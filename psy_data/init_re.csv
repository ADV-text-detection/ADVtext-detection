1,1," According to previous studies, the age at which someone first has sex may influence their life history strategy (LH), and this could be due to experiences and cues during early development. This study looked at whether the experience of sexual debut itself could continue to influence LH strategy throughout adolescence, and found that women who had their first sexual experience between ages 14-18 showed a faster LH speed compared to those who did not. However, this effect weakened by age 23, suggesting that LH-related behaviors can change over time. While other factors may also play a role, the timing of sexual debut may impact LH trajectory and could be further explored in future studies.",0
1,2," LH theory was developed to explain how organisms' reproductive strategies change under environmental constraints. When constraints are loose, organisms tend to have rapid or quantity reproductive strategies, while they adopt more restrained quality reproductive strategies as constraints tighten. This theory applies to various species, including humans, where individual differences in LH strategy covary with factors such as maturation rate, sexual debut, and parental investment. Faster LH strategies involve earlier maturation and sexual debut, more frequent sexual intercourse with less stable pair bonds, and reduced parental investment, while slower LH strategies involve later maturation and sexual debut, lower frequency of sexual intercourse with more stable pair bonds, and increased parental investment.",0
1,3," The earliest models of LH strategy development emphasized the role of childhood experiences in shaping LH-relevant environmental factors across human ancestral environments. Belsky et al. (1991) suggested that the quality of parental attachment in childhood determines whether an individual will be inclined towards a fast or slow LH strategy. Early secure attachment leads to a slow LH strategy focused on delayed maturation and sexual debut, while insecure attachment leads to a fast LH strategy characterized by early maturation, unstable pair bonds, and low parental investment in offspring. Belsky et al. (1991) emphasized that early childhood experiences, particularly within the first 5-7 years of life, play a critical role in determining an individual's developmental trajectory towards a fast or slow LH strategy.",0
1,4," Our theory suggests that one of the main purposes of early life experiences during the first 5-7 years is to teach children about the consistency and reliability of resources available in the environment, the trustworthiness of other people, and the importance of strong interpersonal relationships. Understanding these concepts will impact how individuals distribute their reproductive efforts.",0
1,5," The idea that LH strategy is set and unchangeable by a certain age may not be entirely accurate. While there is evidence of heritability in LH strategy, further research suggests that environmental and somatic cues can also influence LH strategy and that plasticity in LH strategies may persist beyond the first decade of life. However, it is still a debated issue whether early experiences are more important than late experiences in shaping LH strategy. Some studies indicate that environmental predictability in the first five years of life can have a significant impact on LH strategy later in life, while experiences in later childhood and adolescence may not have the same effect.",0
1,6," The theory proposed by Del Giudice in 2009 outlines the impact of factors beyond the age of seven on LH strategies. Early adolescence, specifically adrenarche, is suggested to be an additional switch point that affects the development of LH strategies. This idea has been further extended by Ellis et al. and Del Giudice and Belsky, suggesting the period of cue-based plasticity extends through puberty and into later adolescence. Dunkel et al. found evidence supporting the idea that LH strategies may continue to be adjusted throughout development, even beyond the age of 5 to 7, and that maternal authoritative parenting during adolescence predicts later LH strategy.",0
1,7," The authors of the current investigation are looking at how LH strategy in adolescence continues to evolve through plasticity. They decided to study the age of sexual debut as a potential factor in the development of LH strategies during adolescence. While sexual debut has been used mostly as a dependent variable, it may also serve as an LH cue that can impact LH speed. A study by Vigil et al. (2005) found that childhood sexual abuse can accelerate LH speed, potentially because the act of intercourse itself plays a role in LH development. Women who were victims of childhood sexual abuse also had earlier menarche, earlier first intercourse, and earlier first childbirth.",0
1,8," The main idea of the study is that starting sexual activities speeds up the LH (life history) strategy. The hypothesis is that this response is due to internal cues associated with the experience of having sex, which were functional and relevant for reproductive success in the past. The study suggests that internal cues may be more reliable predictors than external cues from the environment. Consequently, the loss of virginity may trigger a shift in investment from growth towards increased reproductive effort, promoting the acceleration of LH speed.",0
1,9," The costs of losing virginity are higher for females than males and this tradeoff between growth and reproduction is more noticeable for ancestral women. Therefore, we predict that the start of sexual activity will affect LH (life history) speed more in adolescent females than males. This prediction is based on data from a longitudinal study conducted by Block and Block (2006a), which includes information on LH strategy and timing of sexual debut.",0
1,10," The Block and Block study, conducted over a 30-year period, involved multiple waves of data collection and testing. The files and documentation for the study were downloaded from the Henry A. Murray Research Archive. Participants were recruited from two preschools in Berkeley, CA, and demographic information was collected during the first wave of data collection, including sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.",0
1,11," The study analyzed data from three different waves of participants' lives, at ages 14, 18, and 23. The researchers were interested in how participants' LH strategy changed over time, so they used the age 14 data as a starting point. There were 106 participants at age 14, with slightly more females than males. The majority were White, with a small percentage of Black, Asian-American, and ""Other"" participants. Since there were very few non-Black minorities, these participants were grouped together with the White participants for analysis.",0
1,12," The California Q-sort (CAQ) was used to measure the LH strategy by sorting a set of 100 items based on their description of an individual. A template was created by Sherman et al. to measure LH strategy using this method, which was later validated and modified by Dunkel et al. using the Block and Block data.",0
1,13," Between the ages of 14, 18, and 23, trained raters used a personality test called the CAQ to rate each participant's personality. These ratings were then compared to a LH strategy template, and participants were given a score based on how closely their ratings matched the template. Higher scores indicate a slower LH strategy, with items like ""sympathetic/considerate"" reflecting slow LH speed and items like ""unable to delay gratification"" reflecting fast LH speed.",0
1,14," At 18 years old, the participants were asked if they had engaged in sexual activity in the past three years. 42 participants said yes while 60 participants said no.",0
1,15," The study included three demographic covariates: sex, ethnicity (classified as White and nonWhite due to limited sample size), and socioeconomic status (measured by Warner's Index of SES at age 4).",0
1,16," The study included four additional variables besides demographic factors, including intelligence, parenting style of both mother and father, and the level of intimacy with the partner with whom the participants lost their virginity. Intelligence was measured at age 18 to control for the impact of cognitive ability on decision-making about sexual consent. Authoritative parenting was also included as a covariate as it affects the development of LH strategies during adolescence. Finally, the level of intimacy with the partner was measured to explore its impact on the effect of losing one's virginity.",0
1,17," The article presents data in Table 1 showing mean and standard deviation of LH scores by age, sex, and sexual debut. The LH scores increase after age 14, indicating normative development from adolescence to adulthood. Males exhibit a faster LH strategy at all ages. A repeated measures ANOVA confirms the within-subjects effect of age and the between-subjects effect of participant sex. The interaction between variables is not significant. Correlations between sexual debut and LH strategy at the three focal ages vary.",0
1,18, The study aimed to investigate if early sexual debut accelerates LH speed and if it affects females more than males. The researchers used partial correlation to examine the relationship between sexual debut and LH strategy at ages 18 and 23 while controlling for the variance in both variables. Partial correlation was chosen as it was a more suitable method than repeated measures ANOVA or regression in testing the hypothesis.,0
1,19," The study first adjusted the partial correlations for LH speed at age 14 and then added additional covariates one by one such as SES, ethnicity, IQ, maternal and paternal authoritative parenting, and intimacy level with partner. The results were recorded in Table 2. It was found that when only controlling for LH strategy at age 14, there was a correlation between LH strategy at age 18 and sexual debut, but not at age 23. Moreover, the association between sexual debut and LH strategy at age 18 changed as more covariates were added.",0
1,20," The analysis revealed that when looking at females specifically, the relationship between sexual debut and LH strategy remained consistent at age 18 and appeared to strengthen as additional factors were considered at age 23. Researchers also computed change scores to assess the impact of sexual debut on LH speed over time. Results showed that those who had sexual intercourse during adolescence experienced slower LH speed compared to those who did not, but statistical power was limited in between-subjects change score comparisons. These findings helped to interpret the significant correlations observed in the study.",0
1,21," Recent research has suggested that plasticity in the development of life history strategies continues beyond early childhood. Studies have hypothesized that the timing of sexual debut can affect the development of LH strategies, specifically accelerating LH speed during adolescence. It was also theorized that females may be more impacted by this effect. To test these hypotheses, the connection between sexual debut and LH strategy at ages 14, 18, and 23 was investigated.",0
1,22," The research results present multiple options. The study found that for females, having their first sexual experience could impact the trajectory of their LH strategy. When controlling for various factors and LH strategy in early adolescence, girls who had sex during their teenage years had a faster LH speed in late adolescence and young adulthood. These findings are interconnected with the raw LH score's developmental changes over time, where the score increases with age. Furthermore, those who did not engage in intercourse during adolescence showed a smaller increase in LH scores compared to their counterparts who did have sex.",0
1,23," The idea that sexual debut prompts women's engagement in risky tactics of intrasexual competition and/or mate attraction in line with a fast LH strategy, which depends on an individual's degree of investment in mating effort. Sexual intercourse would have served as a cue for progressing into a LH stage, during which acquiring reproductive benefits would have become a crucial adaptive problem. However, it is unclear whether virginity loss results in a longer-lasting developmental shift toward a fast LH speed that persists into adulthood. Women's sexual debut between 14 and 18 initiates a temporary shift toward investment in mating effort, subject to further recalibration as developmental events unfold. Further life stage-linked shifts in LH after age 18 are expected to weaken the association of events in early adolescence with later outcomes.",0
1,24, The study suggests that LH variation is regulated by early and later cues during development. Biometric measures have previously been used to indicate different LH strategies in individuals. Correlational findings support the idea that sexual debut may influence LH speed and investment in mating effort. The timing of sexual debut and LH development in adolescence appear to be connected.,0
1,25," Nonetheless, there are certain restraints that must be acknowledged. While several factors were taken into account, the role of genetics in both the timing of sexual initiation and LH strategy cannot be completely ruled out. Additionally, considering that LH strategy at 14 years was one of the controls, genetic factors must look beyond fundamental additive models, and additive impacts seem to account for most of the heredity in psychological traits. Another limitation is that the influence of sexual debut on LH strategy velocity tends to fade away as individuals progress into adulthood. Therefore, future research is essential to explore the associations between biometric and psychosocial events and the evolution of LH strategy from adolescence to later adulthood.",0
1,26," The Henry A. Murray Research Archive, located at Harvard University's Institute for Quantitative Social Science, made this project possible. The data used in this study came from a 30-year longitudinal study conducted by Jack and Jeanne H. Block, which involved assessing the personality and cognitive life of 128 3-year-old boys and girls through nine assessments that consisted of different measures such as observational, test, and self-report measures.",0
2,1," The latest technology for recording pigeons' pecking behavior are contact switches and touch screens. However, other behaviors require different sensors, and some behaviors are difficult to record. To address this issue, a novel image-based approach that utilizes Microsoft's Kinect sensor is presented. This approach can detect and count other pigeon behaviors besides pecking, such as feeding activity. The system, called BehaviorWatch, was tested on five pigeons and showed reliable results. Consequently, BehaviorWatch could be an excellent solution to record multiple behaviors in pigeons.",0
2,2," Documenting the pecking behavior of pigeons by using a pigeon key that is connected to a contact switch is a typical method for studying animal behavior and learning. This method only documents whether a peck happened or not at a particular moment and place. Nowadays, touch-sensitive screens that provide more precise information about the location of the peck are frequently employed. Additional information could be obtained if a video were used, including:'.",0
2,3," The relevant factors during pecking, such as when it starts, how fast it moves, head position during and after, pecking behavior towards the key, and attempted pecks. Additionally, the overall body and head posture, including head, body, and feet positions. Lastly, the subject's behavior in response to stimuli, such as turning and flapping wings.",0
2,4," The sensing technology used is noncontact and reduces the occurrence of mechanical wear. This allows for sensing to be done at different locations without the need for specific instrumentation, thus allowing for flexible experimental design. Touch screens are an alternative, but they may not be able to prevent visible damage to the screen or other forms of wear. There are also additional costs associated with touch screens, and software for learning experiments is not readily available. Aside from all this, both touch screens and pigeon keys can only detect certain behaviors, limiting the scope of studies to pecks and other behaviors, like treadle pressing, head bobbing, and so on. Other forms of naturally occurring behaviors are challenging to study.",0
2,5," The use of a standard video camera for automated behavior counting is complicated due to loss of depth information of objects in the scene. The intensity of each pixel in the image is created by light arriving along a single ray, making it difficult to determine the distance at which the object rests. To address this issue, a carefully calibrated camera with precise extrinsic and intrinsic parameters should be used. However, loose animal hair or dirt may affect the calibration, thus requiring frequent repetition.",0
2,6," Despite the challenges of using image analysis to track animal movements, there have been some successful attempts at automating video information extraction from a camera. For instance, image recognition criteria have been used to monitor pigeon behaviors like courtship, while image analysis has been utilized to classify avian observations according to species. However, computer vision packages like the Sensory Orientation Software (SOS) have been found to be sensitive to disturbances of camera pose during measurements. Recently, a more affordable and versatile solution has been developed in the form of the Kinect, a camera and distance sensor that generates both visual and depth images by registering pixel coordinates from both images.",0
2,7," An image can be represented by a map of its intensity called I, where I(u,v) represents the intensity at row u and column v. The depth image retrieved using the IR range sensor can be represented by a map called D, where D(u,v) shows the distance between the object responsible for the intensity reading I(u, v) and the sensor. Using the camera focal length, x and y coordinates can be projected from u and v scene coordinates and z = D(u, v) to develop a point cloud. The Kinect sensor, widely used in the consumer video gaming market, is cheap and widespread, and has software support from both Microsoft and Open source communities. The sensor is designed for indoor unstructured settings and can be easily mounted to an experimental enclosure. It includes software that allows the generation and tracking of human body features using a skeletal model. Such models have been a topic of research for some time, and extracting them from distance sensors like the Kinect has been described in a number of studies.",0
2,8," The article discusses a flexible method to use the Kinect for Windows sensor to extract 3-D body information of a pigeon viewed within an experimental enclosure. The method is embodied in a program called BehaviorWatch, which uses a simple skeletal model to represent key body locations. The approach is capable of estimating pecking behavior and identifying ""treadle pressing"" or ""head bobbing."" The results of the approach were compared with a standard contact-switch-based approach and showed similar measurements for pecking. Additionally, feeding behavior can be detected with close timing when the signal is sent to provide a food reward.",0
2,9," The evidence shows that mealtimes can be stressful for patients with Anorexia Nervosa. These patients often experience fear and anxiety when eating and gaining weight. They may feel psychologically and physically uncomfortable after meals, and may be preoccupied with thoughts of purging or guilt. To alleviate this distress, support from staff or family during mealtimes is important. In-patient staff typically facilitate supported mealtimes, but there is little research into effective interventions for reducing meal-related anxiety in a hospital setting.",0
2,10," Participation in music therapy has been shown to enhance the overall life quality, interpersonal relationships, and social skills of individuals with mental illnesses. It enables patients to improve their self-determination and fosters collaboration with their caregivers by focusing on their strengths and resource-oriented approach. Research also supports the effectiveness of music therapy in mental health recovery and patient-led processes that promote empowerment and self-efficacy. Inpatient mental healthcare settings may provide little opportunity for self-determination, which makes music therapy an essential tool for promoting feelings of empowerment and equality.",0
2,11," The use of music therapy has been found to provide positive effects on recovery from eating disorders. It can help with distraction from negative thoughts and feelings, boost motivation, encourage creative expression, and provide a sense of empowerment. Patient experiences have also shown increased self-confidence and engagement through participation in music therapy. Although there is limited research on the role of music therapy during meal times, a study aims to evaluate the potential benefits of post-meal music therapy among inpatients with AN.",0
2,12," The research was conducted in a specialized inpatient eating disorder program consisting of five beds within a psychiatric unit. This program is mostly for adults with severe anorexia nervosa who have not been successful in outpatient treatment. The average age of patients admitted to the program is 22 years old, predominantly young women. The approach used is patient-centered and focuses on individualized treatment utilizing collaborative conceptualisation-based therapy. The treatment also includes a supported mealtime with post-meal distress tolerance and support provided by team members every lunchtime.",0
2,13," The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of post-meal music therapy for inpatients with AN by gathering both quantitative and qualitative data. The study involved using a mixed method approach, where participants were asked to self-report on their experiences and their levels of distress during post-meal support. The authors chose to focus on the quantitative component of the study, which involved comparing the effectiveness of music therapy with standard treatment following mealtime. This design was viewed as a fitting way to evaluate an existing music therapy program and gather initial indicators of its effectiveness, while also testing the feasibility of conducting a larger-scale study.",0
2,14," The researchers gathered quantitative data using a scale called Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS). The participants underwent the intervention twice a week, and their progress was recorded before and after each session. They continued with their usual ward program for the rest of the week. The project was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at Austin Health.",0
2,15," Adults who were admitted to the eating disorders program at the Mental Health Clinical Service Unit of Austin Health were asked to take part in the study. The main researcher, Bibb, provided patients with a statement and consent form when they were admitted to the hospital. A total of 18 patients consented to participate in the study out of 32. Throughout the study, 89 intervention sessions and 84 control sessions were recorded.",0
2,16," The researchers taught the participants how to use the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS), which is a tool used to measure how anxious or distressed someone is feeling. Participants rated their anxiety on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating a complete absence of anxiety and 10 indicating the highest level of distress ever experienced. A 'feelings thermometer' was used to visually represent these ratings.",0
2,17," The study involved weekly music therapy group sessions lasting for an hour each, held after lunch. A qualified music therapist facilitated the sessions where participants were encouraged to sing, listen to and share music, and even compose songs together. The group aimed at providing a distraction and an opportunity for participants to practice coping skills using music. A humanistic approach was followed whereby participants collaborated instead of a directive approach used in cognitive behavioral therapy groups. The therapist maintained an attitude of unconditional positive regard, and members were encouraged to discuss song lyrics and eating disorder recovery-related topics.",0
2,18," The control group received structured post-meal support therapy, which involved a one-hour group session after meals three times a week. The sessions focused on discussing feelings, achieving admission goals, and participating in group activities like games and art. Nursing and allied health staff took turns facilitating the therapy.",0
2,19, The data was analyzed using the statistical software SPSS. The pre and post scores were compared in both the intervention and control groups to determine the mean differences and standard deviation. An unpaired t-test was used to compare the differences between the music therapy and control interventions.,0
2,20," The study included 18 patients, with the majority being females. Their ages varied from 20 to 58 years old, and the length of their hospital stay varied from 21 to 90 days. The participants attended a total of 173 sessions between the music therapy and control conditions. Results showed that the mean pre-test and post-test scores for the intervention group were 8 and 5.6 respectively, with a pre-post test difference of 2.4 integers and a standard deviation of 1.9 integers. The control group's mean pre-test and post-test scores were 8.1 and 7.1 respectively, with a pre-post test difference of 0.93 integers and a standard deviation of 1.7 integers. These results are summarized in Table 1.",0
2,21," The study found a significant difference between the control and intervention conditions with an ANOVA score of f=28.5 and a p-value of <0.0001. The average anxiety scores were higher among all participants in the pre-test (mean of 8.1) compared to the post-test (mean of 6.3) across 173 occasions. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant difference (p=<0.0001) between pre-test and post-test scores for all 173 occasions combined.",0
2,22," The study aimed to compare the levels of distress and anxiety in patients with AN before and after group music therapy was provided after meals, as opposed to standard post-meal support therapy. The results showed strongly positive outcomes, indicating that music therapy can be helpful for AN inpatient care. Both groups experienced decreased anxiety after the music therapy sessions compared to before, which supports previous research indicating that meal-related distress and anxiety is a major concern for AN patients. Similarly, participants in both conditions reported reduced anxiety after therapist-facilitated support after meals, which is consistent with previous studies.",0
2,23," The current study found that group music therapy is more successful in reducing meal-related anxiety than standard post-meal support therapy in an inpatient setting for eating disorder patients with an average age of 22. This could be due to the engaging and non-threatening nature of music therapy, which may act as a cognitive distraction for patients, allowing time for digestion while the mind is occupied with something enjoyable.",0
2,24," The condition known as AN involves avoiding and controlling emotions, which can lead to feeling emotionally numb. Music therapy can be used as a distress tolerance technique, allowing patients to experience emotions through music instead of discussion. In this case, the musical process itself is the therapy, which could have wider implications for using music therapy as an alternative coping technique for patients who struggle with distressing emotions.",0
2,25," The use of music therapy in inpatient meal support programs has been found to significantly decrease anxiety in participants with eating disorders. This is important because, while it was previously known that support after mealtime was helpful, the interventions that were effective in reducing anxiety during this time were unclear. Incorporating music therapy into these programs can give patients an alternative technique to cope with distress that they can use after discharge. This study is the first to use music therapy post meal-time and offers support for further research in this area.",0
2,26," The study has positive implications for using music therapy to reduce meal-related anxiety in patients with AN. Limitations of the study include the research design, which was quasi-experimental, and the fact that participants were not randomized. Additionally, participants were recruited from only one site, which may limit the generalizability of the results. To improve future research in this area, larger numbers of participants should be involved and randomization to control and intervention conditions should be included. Recruitment from different hospital sites would also be beneficial.",0
3,1," The study investigated how attentional focus and perceived hole size affect radial putting error in experienced golfers. The golfers were randomly assigned to either the Hole task or Club task after completing a putt and were tested under no pressure, pressure phase, and no pressure posttest. The results showed that golfers differed in their response to pressure, with some showing significant changes in kinematic variables and heart rate (Choke group) while others showed no changes (Clutch group). The Choke group had increased putting error and decreased accuracy on the Hole task, while the Clutch group had no significant changes in any of the variables. These results support the attentional accentuation hypothesis of action-specific effects.",0
3,2," Recent studies have shown that skills which involve interacting with objects to achieve a goal can affect a person's perception of that object. For instance, individuals who perform better at hitting a ball tend to judge the ball as larger than those who perform poorly. Similarly, studies have found similar effects in golf, football, dart throwing, archery, and aviation. These findings suggest that perception is influenced by an individual's ability to interact effectively with goal objects in the environment, rather than being solely based on the object's physical properties. This is consistent with Gibson's theory that perception directly specifies the relationship between a person and their environment, rather than simply being based on the object itself.",0
3,3," Despite the fact that research has shown action-specific effects on perception, the specific mechanisms behind these effects are not well understood. There are alternative explanations, such as those based on experimental demands and memory effects, but the present study focuses on attentional accentuation as another possibility. This hypothesis suggests that when someone intends to act on an object and directs their attention to it, that object becomes more noticeable, which has been supported by previous research on golfers perceiving changes in the size of a golf hole.",0
3,4," The theory is further supported by research that investigated action-specific perception in situations with high levels of anxiety, where participants threw darts at a target and assessed its size. Under low anxiety conditions, target size and throwing performance had a positive correlation, but this was not the case with high anxiety conditions, where attention was drawn away from the target, consistent with distraction theory and self-monitoring.",0
3,5," The aim of this study was to explore how attention affects perception in relation to performing certain actions, building on research previously done on anxiety and performance outcomes. Earlier research failed to produce direct evidence that changes in action-specific perception were caused by shifts in attentional focus. However, investigations into how attention affects movement and performance have found links between successful performance, attentional focus, and movement kinematics under pressure conditions, such as in a study on baseball batters.",0
3,6," The act of focusing on a skill in golf putting can lead to an increase in putting error and changes in putting kinematics. These changes can include an increase in club-ball impact velocity, a decrease in the time to peak speed, and changes in downswing amplitude and putting distance. These changes are typically observed in novice golfers. However, previous studies have not examined how these kinematic changes relate to the perceived size of the target object. Additionally, no previous studies have directly manipulated attentional focus and measured the effect on perceived size, despite the links between attentional focus and perceived size inferred through fixation patterns.",0
3,7," The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived size, performance outcomes, attentional focus, and movement kinematics in a golf putting task. The researchers measured each of these variables while participants performed the putting task under different pressure conditions. The study used a combination of competitive and evaluative pressures to induce performance pressure. The researchers also used an attentional probe method to determine whether participants were focusing on the hole or the movement of their club-head. Time to peak speed was measured as the primary kinematic measure, as it has been shown to be related to skill level and influenced by pressure in golf.",0
3,8," The research included 25 participants consisting of 17 males and 8 females, all of whom were right-handed experienced golfers from the University of Birmingham's School of Sport, Exercise & Rehabilitation Science program. The participants' average age, mean handicap, and competitive playing experience were 20.1 (with a standard error of 0.4), 7.3 (with a standard error of 0.6) strokes, and 6.2 (with a standard error of 0.8) years, respectively. The Science, Technology, Mathematics and Engineering Ethical Review Committee at the University of Birmingham granted ethical approval for the study.",0
3,9," The experiment used a right-handed putter, Wilson Ultra golf balls, and an artificial putting mat of specific dimensions. The task given to participants was to putt towards a red circle on the mat and stop the ball as close to the center of the circle as possible. The putts were made from a set distance and the position of the putter head was tracked using a sensor.",0
3,10," The researchers used a method similar to one used in a previous study to estimate how big the participants perceived the hole to be. They asked them to draw a life-sized circle on a computer screen using PowerPoint and positioned the screen at the same distance as the putting distance. They also presented auditory stimuli using speakers placed at the end of the putting surface, 10 cm away from the hole, which had been determined in pilot experiments.",0
3,11, The heart rate was measured to indicate the activity of the sympathetic nervous system using a heart rate receiver unit connected to a transmitter with electrodes placed on the lower mid thorax. The average heart rate was then calculated during different phases.,0
3,12," The researchers conducted an experiment that consisted of four phases which were practice, pretest, pressure, and posttest. Each phase was completed within a 1.5-hour session, and participants had 10-minute breaks between each phase. During all the test phases, the participants were shown the final position of the ball on the green.",0
3,13," In this stage, the participants were given 20 opportunities to putt the ball normally without any additional task. The purpose of this phase was to help them get comfortable with the sensor attached to the back of the club and familiarize them with the putting exercise. They didn't have to estimate the size of the hole during this phase. After every putt, the experimenter measured the distance between the center of the target and the ball's final position in centimeters.",0
3,14, The researchers used data from practice trials to determine the timing of participants' putting strokes. This information was later used to control one of the secondary tasks. The researchers determined the start and back stroke times for each putting stroke and calculated the mean values for each participant.,0
3,15," The participants were first explained about the hole size estimation task in this phase and were given practice sessions five times without hitting the ball. Then, they were introduced to two secondary tasks, where auditory cues were presented in the form of pure tones with a frequency of 500Hz and duration of 150ms via one of the two speakers placed on either side of the hole. These two tasks were modelled after Beilock and Gray (2012) and were performed by the participants by detecting the tone during their backswing. The data from those trials were discarded where the tone was not presented in the appropriate interval, and the trial was re-run.",0
3,16," The participants were asked to decide if the tone they heard was coming from the left or right speaker or from the hole by making a forced choice. They had to say ""Bleft"" or ""Bright"" after they hit the putt.",0
3,17," The club task involved participants making a decision regarding where the tone occurred during their backswing by saying ""Bstart"" or ""Bend"", indicating if it was near the start or end. This task was chosen because previous studies have shown that this phase of the putting stroke is particularly sensitive to attentional manipulations and golfers can perform well in this capacity.",0
3,18," Participants were asked to complete 30 putts after finishing all the practice trials. For each putt, they hit the ball and saw where it landed, then estimated the hole size. After each attempt, they were given instructions on what secondary task response to provide by a researcher. The putts were broken down into 12 with the Hole Task prompt, 12 with the Club Task prompt, and 6 with no prompt. The order and speaker side for each task were randomized. There was no feedback given to participants during the experiment.",0
3,19," The researchers wanted to ensure that the secondary task did not affect the estimate of hole size, so they had participants complete it after making the estimate. Some trials did not involve a secondary task to measure where participants were focusing their attention. The participants did not know which task they would have to perform, so there was no bias in their attentional focus. These tasks were selected to compare with previous research, and their interaction with the hole size estimation task is discussed later.",0
3,20," The pressure phase was the same as the pretest phase, but the participants were given additional instructions to make them feel more competitive and evaluated. They were told these instructions before starting to putt, and they had to read a script explaining the changes.",0
3,21," The next stage of the activity is a competition where the aim is still to putt the ball as close to the marker as possible, but you will lose 10 points for every putt that finishes more than 5 cm from the marker. The prize money of ?50, ?25, and ?10 is available for the top three places. Your position on the leaderboard will depend on the number of points you accumulate. The results will be sent to all participants via email and displayed on the school's notice board, so everyone will know how others performed. The speaker jokingly mentions that there is no pressure, but good luck.",0
3,22," The method being used is the same as the one used in a previous study on how pressure affects golf performance, and it has shown to have notable effects.",0
3,23," To evaluate the intensity of cognitive and somatic anxiety among participants, the Immediate Anxiety Measures Scale (IAMS) was used. The two-item questionnaire asked participants to rate their levels of cognitive anxiety and somatic anxiety on a 7-point scale ranging from not at all to extremely. The scale was completed at the conclusion of each phase of the experiment.",0
3,24," The researchers performed a manipulation check in order to see if their pressure manipulation had the intended impact. They analyzed cognitive and somatic anxiety ratings, as well as heart rate data, using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA, with pretest, pressure, and posttest phases as the independent variable.",0
3,25," The researchers analyzed four dependent variables which included the mean radial error, mean perceived hole size, percentage correct for the Hole secondary task, and percentage correct for the Club secondary task. Each variable was examined using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA with phase as the independent variable.",0
3,26," The results of the experiment are presented through Figure 2, which displays the MRE for two groups during different phases. The data was analyzed using a 2x3 mixed ANOVA with group and phase as factors. The analysis showed significant main effects of the phase and the group x phase interaction. Post-hoc t tests indicated that MRE was significantly higher in the pressure phase for the Choke group, whereas other comparisons were not significant.",0
3,27," Although it has been shown that the way a performer interacts with an object can affect how big it appears to them, the mechanism behind this has not been fully understood. One question that has not been answered is whether attention plays a role in these effects. Some previous studies suggest that attention may mediate the effects, but a direct link has yet to be established.",0
3,28," The study aimed to investigate the phenomenon of choking under pressure in skilled motor performance by examining the relationship between perceived hole size, performance outcome, and attentional focus in a golf putting task. The secondary goal was to explore the connection between movement kinematics and perceived target size, which has not been thoroughly investigated in previous studies.",0
3,29," The researchers found that adding pressure to some golfers resulted in significant changes in their putting technique. Specifically, 11 out of 25 golfers had a shorter time to peak speed (TTPS) and higher velocity. This typically occurs in novice golfers who have a more symmetrical putting stroke, while expert golfers have an asymmetrical stroke with a later TTPS.",0
3,30," The benefit of using an asymmetric putting stroke with a longer time period of solid contact between the club-head and ball is that it results in a smoother roll across the green. In the present study, the golfers in the Choke group showed a decrease in this time period, indicating a regression in skill acquisition due to pressure. This idea is supported by the higher MRE in the pressure phase for the Choke group.",0
3,31," The study found that golfers who experienced choking under pressure had a change in their putting style, and this change was linked to a shift of their focus towards executing the skill and away from external factors. The golfers also showed a decrease in accuracy for tasks related to the external environment and an increase in accuracy for tasks related to the internal execution of the skill. These findings support theories that suggest pressure causes golfers to focus inwardly, resulting in a control strategy similar to that of a less experienced golfer.",0
3,32," The study had important design choices that could have affected the results and need to be studied further. One of the choices was allowing participants to see the final position of the ball after each putt, which could have influenced their judgment of the size of the hole. However, previous studies have shown that perceived target size remained stable even when performance outcome variability was directly manipulated. Further research is needed to examine whether the findings of this study hold true when performers are not given knowledge of results.",0
3,33," The timing of the secondary task used to measure attentional focus during the putting stroke could not be used to directly assess attentional focus before the initiation of the putt. However, research suggests that attentional focus patterns are similar before, during, and after the stroke, and attentional shifts during the stroke can spill over into behavior before and after the movement.",0
3,34, The study contributes to our knowledge of how specific actions affect our perception. It shows that the amount of attention an object receives from an actor is directly linked to how big they perceive it to be. This supports the attentional accentuation hypothesis. The study also found that changes in putting kinematics were observed alongside changes in attentional focus and perceived size.,0
4,1," The theory of Signal Detection assumes that likelihood ratios are used to make decisions in recognition memory, and previous research has shown that this assumption leads to the Mirror, Variance, and z-ROC Length Effects. A study of data from 36 studies validated these effects, but noted that bias can obscure the Mirror Effect. This paper examines how bias affects the regularities at a theoretical level and offers four ways to counter the obscuring. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the three regularities govern individual and group performance, and that Signal Detection Theory provides a simple explanation of recognition memory data.",0
4,2," The authors of a previous study (Glanzer et al., 2009) showed that the ability to recognize things is in line with the standard Signal Detection Theory (Green & Swets, 1966/1974) by using likelihood ratios (LR). They demonstrated this through three different stages.",0
4,3," The LR assumption is proven to result in three regularities - the Mirror Effect, Variance Effect, and the z-ROC Length Effect. The regularities are explained and examples are given to demonstrate how LR decisions lead to these patterns. Finally, a survey of recognition memory data proves that these regularities are widespread.",0
4,4," In a 2009 paper, two topics were briefly discussed: how bias can obscure the Mirror Effect and how to counter it. The current study provides a more detailed analysis of these two topics. The authors demonstrate that the Mirror Effect, which is usually measured, is affected by bias. To counter the bias effect, they suggest four different strategies. The first is to use a more informative index of the Mirror Effect, the second is to cancel the bias with a pay-off arrangement, the third is to use a between-list design, and the fourth is to increase the difference in accuracy between the two experimental conditions (familiar vs. unfamiliar names).",0
4,5," The objection to the survey in Glanzer et al. (2009) is that the data was collected from groups rather than individuals, which may not accurately represent the underlying processes. This issue of disagreement between group and individual data has been extensively discussed by Estes (1956) and Estes and Maddox (2005). However, the results presented in this study show that the three regularities hold true for individual performance.",0
4,6," The recognition memory experiment involves showing participants a list of items to study and a test list which includes some items previously seen and some new ones. Participants then have to indicate if each item is old or new, or rate their confidence in their decision.",0
4,7," The use of two different types of items or conditions in experiments can produce a difference in accuracy. These experiments demonstrate three patterns resulting from LR decisions: the Mirror Effect, Variance Effect, and z-ROC Length Effect.",0
4,8," If there are two groups of objects in a recognition test that have different accuracy rates and the choices are made using LR, the S group will perform better in identifying old and new items correctly. The difference is often noticeable in a yes/no test where there is a similar ratio of hits and false alarms.",0
4,9," The accuracy of recognition tests can be affected by two sets of items or conditions. When decision-making is based on likelihood ratios (LR), there is a novel general effect on the relative variances of the new and old distributions. The new distribution of the superior condition will have a larger variance than the weaker, lower accuracy condition. The same effect also applies to the old distributions. The effect is measured using the slope of the z-ROC of new and old items ratings. If decision-making is based on LR, the slope will be less than 1.0.",0
4,10, The length of z-ROC contracts varies based on accuracy when making decisions using LR. The z-ROC becomes shorter as the condition becomes more precise.,0
4,11," The log likelihood ratio, ¦«, will be used going forward because it makes equations simpler. ¦«, which is a function of random variable X, is also a random variable with its own distribution, mean, and variance. The distribution of ¦« is determined by the distribution of X and the function ¦Ë().",0
4,12," The authors used linear regression to estimate linear fits and slopes for the computed examples of the models. There is no problem using linear regression in this context because the ROC curves represent theoretical distributions, and neither axis is subject to random error.",0
4,13, The article presents an example of a Normal Equal Variance Model to explain the regularities and their generation. They assume a recognition memory model based on normal equal variance distributions as the equations and the displays are simple. The article shows that the unequal variance normal model generates the same regularities as the equal variance case. The regularities also apply to recognition memory models based on binomial and exponential distributions. The article adds that converting LR to log LR doesn't change the effects discussed but helps to present simpler equations and plots.,0
4,14," In this specific scenario, the variables SN and WN are both following a Normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Meanwhile, the variable WO follows a Normal distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 1, and SO follows a Normal distribution with a mean of 1.75 and a standard deviation of 1. As for decision making, the model takes into account the likelihood ratio.",0
4,15," Figures 2A and B show the model's theoretical level, while Figures 2C and D illustrate observable data based on the model. Figure 2A reveals the initial distribution of raw information for SN, WN, WO, and SO called ""strength,"" ""familiarity,"" or ""amount of marking."" SO is located to the right of WO, indicating greater precision. SN and WN are not separated because unstudied items may not vary in strength. The new distributions are not separated, and the LR transformation's effects are displayed clearly, indicating that when SO shifts above WO, SN will move in the opposite direction, below WN, on the LR decision axis.",0
4,16," When someone makes a decision using LR, the densities shown in Fig. 2A are rearranged on a logarithmic scale in Fig. 2B. The likelihoods represented by these figures are random variables that follow a normal distribution, according to Glanzer et al.'s research. The three regularities are demonstrated in Figures 2B, C, and D.",0
4,17," Figure 2B illustrates that by using a log likelihood decision axis, the distributions SN and WN become separated, which were previously in the same position in Fig. 2A. This separation causes the Mirror Effect to appear with the distributions ordered.",0
4,18," Glanzer and colleagues (2009) discovered that the H/FA Mirror Index does not work well in situations where there are biases present. This means that the index may show that there is no Mirror Effect, even when the distributions are actually in mirror order. Despite this flaw, we discuss the H/FA Mirror Index extensively in this paper because it is commonly used.",0
4,19, Recognition memory tests can be affected by bias if the observer has misunderstood the likelihood of an item being old. The likelihood-ratio procedure can be used to describe how decisions are made based on past experience and the distribution of effects from stimuli. Overestimating the likelihood of certain alternatives can lead to bias in decision making. This was discussed by Wickens in 2002.,0
4,20," The second component represents the benefits and drawbacks of different accurate and erroneous answers. If the cost of a false alarm goes up, then the person is expected to raise their threshold for making a decision and become more cautious in responding ""Yes.""",0
4,21," The authors presented five experiments that demonstrate three LR regularities and the impact of bias. The first experiment explored the normality of word frequency as a strength variable, while the subsequent four experiments examined familiarity of names as a strength variable.",0
4,22," The regularities were observed in all five experiments. However, the second experiment revealed that the H/FA Index may not accurately measure the Mirror Effect due to bias. Nevertheless, the Distance Mirror Index was still able to show the effect. To counter the bias effects on the H/FA Index, the third, fourth, and fifth experiments introduced three other methods.",0
4,23," The experiment results are presented in four stages. Firstly, the pooled results of confidence ratings of all individuals are reported, which provides a general view of regularity results but does not allow standard statistical analysis. However, the measures derived from this stage correspond closely to those obtained from subsequent standard analyses. Secondly, the conventional analysis of the Mirror Effect is presented using the H/FA Index. Thirdly, the three LR regularities based on ROCs computed for each individual are reported, providing distributions of measures that can be statistically analyzed. Lastly, a more detailed analysis of each individual's performance is presented.",0
4,24," The authors want to demonstrate three LR patterns in a straightforward example without any influence of bias. They are doing this by revisiting and analyzing data from a study that looked at the effects of word frequency on recognition. Specifically, they are comparing high frequency words (H) to low frequency words (L), where L is considered the stronger or more accurate condition, while H is considered the weaker or less accurate condition.",0
4,25," The study involved 16 undergraduate participants who completed a task where they had to decide if 248 words were real or not. Then, they were given a test where they had to recognize 248 old words, half of which had high frequency and half had low frequency, and 248 new words. They had to rate their confidence in their recognition on an eight-level scale. More information about the methods and steps taken can be found in the initial research document.",0
4,26," The results of the study, based on ratings from 16 participants, are presented in figure 4A and B, which show the z-ROCs. These graphs reveal certain patterns that were previously identified in a theoretical model (see Fig. 2C and D). The researchers also analyzed these z-ROCs using various measures, such as examining the distances between the underlying distributions and measuring the slopes of certain z-ROCs. These measures were obtained using a statistical program and were used to analyze the Mirror Effect, Variance Effect, and z-ROC Length Effect.",0
4,27," The outcomes of the statistical assessments of the participants' answers are presented in three steps. Firstly, the typical analysis of the H/FA Index of the Mirror Effect, followed by the analysis of the three LR patterns. Lastly, an individual response analysis is conducted with regards to the three LR patterns.",0
4,28," The common way of analyzing the Mirror Effect is by comparing the accuracy of two situations and checking the difference between them. This difference is required for the occurrence of this effect. It is also essential to compare the hit and FA rate for each situation. All the important measures are listed in Table 3, including bias measures.",0
4,29," The question of whether regularities hold for individuals alone was previously mentioned. To address this, the presence of regularities in each individual's data was tabulated and displayed as ratios in the first row of Table 5. All 16 participants showed SN < WN (dnn negative), and all regularities were found to differ significantly from chance (.50) by a binomial test. These results fully support the analyses in Table 4.",0
4,30," In the following section, the authors describe four studies that use familiarity of names as the variable instead of word frequency. The reason for using this variable is to provide additional evidence for the three regularities previously discussed. Additionally, using familiarity allows for the evaluation of an alternative explanation of the Mirror Effect. The four experiments all demonstrate the three LR regularities and illustrate how the bias effects that obscure the mirror effect as measured by the H/FA Index can be addressed.",0
4,32," The study and test list for each participant were created using two main lists, one consisting of well-known individuals from the fields of acting, sports, and politics (F list) and the other consisting of names from a local phonebook (U list). The F list had a mean rating of 1.14, indicating high familiarity among the participants, while the U list had a mean rating of 4.83, suggesting low familiarity. Additional U names were used as practice and filler items to eliminate primacy and recency effects. List names were randomly selected and individually randomized for each participant.",0
4,33," In the study and test, names were shown in capital letters at the center of the screen. For each name during the study, it was shown for 1250 ms and then there was a 750 ms blank screen before the next name. The test was then given with 120 ""F"" names and 120 ""U"" names, half of them being previously studied and the other half being new. The participant could take their own time to respond to each name during the test.",0
4,34," The participants were given a list of names and asked to decide whether each name was old or new using a 6-point confidence rating scale. The confidence ratings ranged from very sure old to very sure new. The participants were able to see the scale on the monitor during the experiment. A practice session was conducted before the actual experiment, which consisted of a 6-item study list followed by a 12-item test list, containing both old and new items.",0
4,35," The information of 38 college students is shared, except for one person whose responses were less than expected. All students had been using English as their language from the age of 10 or earlier, and they took part in the experiment as part of their class. This information is also relevant to the participants in Experiments 3, 4, and 5.",0
4,36," The experiment results in Table 3, second row, indicate a significant difference in accuracy, suggesting the presence of the Mirror Effect. The bias indices for familiar and unfamiliar items also differ significantly, with participants exhibiting a strong conservative bias towards unfamiliar items and a slight liberal bias towards familiar names. This differential bias affects false alarm rates and the H/FA Mirror Index, which only shows a significant difference between HWO and HSO. However, the FAFN versus FAUN comparison is not significant, leading to the conclusion that there was a failure of the Mirror Effect if only the H/FA Index is considered.",0
4,37," The results in Table 4's second row indicate that the Mirror Effect exists, shown by the significant dnn and doo Distance Index (entries 1 and 2). The mean distance between the two new distributions is negative, while the mean distance between the two old distributions is positive. The Distance Index confirms that the Mirror Effect is present, with the distributions ordered as FN < UN < UO < FO. The H/FA Index fails to show this pattern when there is differential bias, whereas the Distance Index reveals its presence.",0
4,38, The frequency of each regularity displayed by individual participants is shown in the second row of Table 5. All three regularities are present and verified as significant by a binomial test. These findings strongly support the analyses presented in Table 4. The number of participants used to compute the ratios varies due to inadequate data from two individuals who did not use enough confidence categories. This same denominator variation occurs in the subsequent experiments due to participants' responses not allowing for the calculation of specific z-ROCs.,0
4,39," To summarize, we have shown that individuals exhibit three regularities in their performance, specifically in terms of their familiarity with names. Additionally, we have found that the conventional H/FA Index for the Mirror Effect is not effective when differential bias is present, and instead should be replaced with the Distance Index that utilizes dnn and doo. We delve into this topic further by detailing how to handle differential bias when using the H/FA Index.",0
4,40," The previous experiment showed that participants were less likely to say ""yes"" to unfamiliar names than to familiar names, which made it difficult to observe the Mirror Effect when using the H/FA Index. To overcome this bias, the experimenters used differential payoffs to cancel out the observed bias and induce a counter-bias. The success of this experiment is important because any failure to observe the Mirror Effect is likely due to such biases. The relationship between bias and the Mirror Effect is that biases hide the effect, especially when using the H/FA Index. Another possible explanation is that the Mirror Effect simply doesn't exist with the materials used in Experiment 2.",0
4,41," In order to determine which interpretation is accurate, we will conduct Experiment 2 again, but this time we will use a feedback system and pay-offs to eliminate any biases. If our original interpretation is correct, we should see the full Mirror Effect, even when accounting for the H/FA Index.",0
4,42," The second experiment was conducted using the same materials, procedure, and participants as the first experiment, with an additional instruction given to the participants regarding the scoring system. They were informed that identifying old, unfamiliar names as ""old"" correctly would earn them +50 points, while incorrectly identifying them as ""new"" would result in a deduction of ?50 points. Any other correct responses would earn them +10, and any incorrect responses would earn them ?10. The total score would be given to the participants at the end of the test.",0
4,43," The diagram in Figure 6 shows the z-ROCs for the group. There are three LR regularities that can be observed. In Figure 6A, the z-ROC for F is higher than U, with dF = 1.45 and dU = 0.77. The length of the F z-ROC is shorter than U, which is known as the zROC Length Effect. In Figure 6B, the old/old z-ROC is located above the main diagonal, while the new/new z-ROC is located below it. This is known as the Mirror Effect, with doo = 0.61 and dnn = -0.40. The slopes for both z-ROCs are less than 1.0, which is known as the Variance Effect.",0
4,45," The sensitivity measures dF and dU have significantly different values, with a pattern observed in the regularities across the two conditions. The mean bias indices cF and cU do not show any difference, indicating that the mirror pattern is not disrupted. The H/FA data shows a mirror pattern, which is statistically evaluated and found to be significant. The experiment's introduction argument is supported by the results, indicating that the Mirror Effect was obscured due to differential bias in Experiment 2. However, removing this bias revealed the effect even when measured by the weaker H/FA index.",0
4,46," Table 4 presents regularity measures based on the z-ROC. The Distance Mirror Index has two means, dnn and doo. The mean dnn is negative and the mean doo is positive, both significantly different from zero. The Variance Effect regularity is indicated by means of the new/new and old/old z-ROCs slopes, which are both significantly less than 1.0. The means for dnn and doo are 0.75 and 0.76, respectively.",0
4,47," The lengths of the standard zROCs for F = 2.75 and U = 3.60 are not the same, according to the statistical test. The z-ROC Length Effect is still valid.",0
4,48, The third row of Table 5 shows the ratios of participants displaying the three regularities. A binomial test confirms that all regularities are significant. These results align with the statistical analyses presented in Table 4.,0
4,49," The three experiments before showed the same patterns, but in Experiment 2, a significant difference in bias removed the Mirror Effect as measured by the H/FA Index. In Experiment 3, this bias issue was fixed through a pay-off system and the H/FA Mirror Effect returned. Another solution is to use a between-list experiment rather than within-list, meaning separating the two conditions into different study-test sequences.",0
4,50," Hoshino conducted experiments to investigate the impact that separate test lists have on bias. Using Japanese kanji and a yes/no procedure, he attempted to replicate the word frequency Mirror Effect with the H/FA Mirror Index. The first two experiments did not show the desired effect, with a higher incidence of ""old"" response for H rather than L words. Hoshino believed that the lack of success was due to differential bias. In a third experiment, two separate test groups were used, with one group being subjected to the same conditions as the first two experiments. The second group showed similar results in line with Hoshino's initial findings, indicating that the H/FA Index was violated due to differential bias.",0
4,51," The diagram in Figure 7 displays the z-ROCs group, which illustrates three LR regularities. The standard z-ROC (Fig. 7A) exhibits a z-ROC length effect, with length F = 2.12 and length U = 3.26, and has dF = 2.26 and dU = 1.02. The old/old z-ROC (Fig. 7B) is positioned above the main diagonal with doo = 1.16 and the new/new z-ROC lies below the main diagonal with dnn = -0.80, which is known as the mirror effect. The slopes of both z-ROCs are less than 1.0, with 0.54 and 0.75, respectively, known as the variance effect.",0
4,52, The first two sets of data in row 4 of Table 3 show differences in accuracy means. The bias indices in the next set of data do not differ significantly. The mixed-list experiment showed a bias difference that disappeared in the between-list paradigm. The H/FA Index demonstrated a clear Mirror Effect when the bias was eliminated.,0
4,53, The regularity measures for Table 4 are listed in the fourth row. The first two values represent the Distance Mirror Index and show a significant Mirror Effect with negative mean dnn and positive mean doo. The next two values are slopes of z-ROCs for new/new and old/old and show a significant Variance Effect with values less than 1.0. The next two values represent a significant length difference with mean length F being less than mean length U. The z-ROC Length Effect is also observed.,0
4,54, The fourth row of Table 5 displays the percentage of individual participants demonstrating each of the three regularities. A binomial test confirms that each regularity is noticeable and significant. This data complements the statistical analysis presented in Table 4.,0
4,55," The bias effect of Experiment 2 will be tackled by enhancing the accuracy of familiar names over unfamiliar names. This will be achieved by reducing the number of familiar names in the study and test lists. Previous experiments that studied the composition of the list have shown that by decreasing the number of items from one sub-list, recognition accuracy for those items can be improved.",0
4,56," Experiment 5 had the same setup as Experiment 2, but with a reduced number of familiar names in both the study and test lists. The study lists had 30 familiar and 60 unfamiliar names, while the test lists contained 30 familiar old, 30 familiar new, 60 unfamiliar old, and 60 unfamiliar new items. Apart from this change, everything else in the experiment, such as the construction of lists and participant characteristics, remained the same as Experiment 2.",0
4,57," The z-ROCs group is illustrated in Figure 8, showing all three LR regularities once again. The standard z-ROC in Figure 8A has dF=2.18 and dU=0.83, indicating the z-ROC Length Effect with the length F=1.78 and U=3.55. Additionally, the Mirror Effect holds as the old/old z-ROC lies above the Main Diagonal with doo=1.61 and the new/new z-ROC lies below the main diagonal with dnn=-1.12. Furthermore, both z-ROC slopes are less than 1.0, at 0.41 and 0.55, respectively, indicating the Variance Effect.",0
4,58," Row 5 of Table 4 presents the regularity means. The first two values indicate a significant Mirror Effect for the Distance Mirror Index with mean dnn < zero, t(40) = 14.93, SE = 0.09, and mean doo > zero, t(34) = 18.37, SE = 0.06. The next two entries, the slopes of the new/new and old/old z-ROCs, show a significant Variance Effect with both values less than 1.0. The mean length F is significantly different from mean length U, F(1, 42) = 76.47, MSE = 0.76, and this is supported by the z-ROC Length Effect.",0
4,59," The accuracy of recognizing items increased when the number of familiar names was reduced. This increased the difference in accuracy between familiar and unfamiliar items and recovered the Mirror Effect. However, it also made responses to familiar names more liberal, which was unexpected. This double effect of experimental operations on both accuracy and bias may be related to the salience of familiar names, which generates relatively liberal responses. When the number of familiar names was reduced, their salience increased, leading to further liberal responses.",0
4,60," The authors argue that the three regularities in SDT can be explained by its three basic concepts: sensitivity, bias, and LR decision axis. SDT can also account for situations when mirror regularity does not appear. Process models of recognition memory that use SDT and LR component do not contradict the general SDT model because they operate at different levels of theory.",0
4,61," The data from a simple memory experiment can be explained without invoking LR decisions, by assuming that decisions are made based on unprocessed strength. However, for more complex experiments with two conditions, strength-based decisions no longer work and LR conversion must be included in the computations to observe regularities in the data.",0
4,62," The Mirror Effect can be explained by making up additional assumptions to support strength decisions. Two ideas, Criterion Shift and Two-Process, have been proposed to explain this effect with their own set of assumptions.",0
4,63," It has been proven through experiments that WN and SN are not fixed and can vary. In these experiments, participants had to choose between WN and SN items, resulting in null choices. The results showed that the two new distributions SN and WN are separated, and SN is less than WN. This was found in all five experiments discussed in the article, where dnn value was negative, indicating that the two new distributions have a separation, and SN is less than WN with distance -dnn.",0
4,64," The Mirror Effect is often explained through the two-process explanation which is limited to the word frequency Mirror Effect. The explanation assumes that individuals use a familiarity/strength decision axis and that low frequency new words start out less familiar than high frequency new words. However, low frequency words are learned and recollected much more effectively than high frequency words, which results in the Mirror Effect inequality, HO < LO.",0
4,65," The Mirror Effect is demonstrated in a standard condition and then disrupted with an operation like presenting stimuli more quickly. This causes a disruption in recollection, as seen through the H/FA Index. However, the two-process explanation only applies to the word-frequency mirror effect and not the name familiarity mirror effect shown in later experiments. Furthermore, this two-process explanation does not cover the Variance Effect and the Length Effect.",0
4,66," The interpretation of mirror disruption caused by speeding varies depending on whether L words or H words are being processed. L words take longer to process than H words, and so speeding affects L words more than H words. This results in decreased accuracy for both types of words, but more so for L words, which in turn reduces the difference in accuracy between the two word types. This difference in accuracy is crucial for the H/FA Index in mirror effect studies. If the difference in accuracy is smaller, then the H/FA Index is less likely to show the mirror effect in two-factor mirror disruption studies. Glanzer et al. (2009) and Experiment 5 demonstrate this effect.",0
4,67," SDT, using its LR decision axis, can explain the data supporting the two-process explanation without assuming any extra processes like familiarity and recollection. It is not limited to explaining the effects of word frequency, which is the case with the two-process explanation.",0
4,68," Experiments 2, 3, 4, and 5 provide evidence against the two-process explanation and any other explanation that indicates a decision axis based on strength/familiarity. These explanations suggest that unfamiliar new names (UN) should have lower values than familiar new names (FN) on the decision axis, resulting in no mirror effect. However, SDT with its LR decision axis predicts the opposite order, with FN having lower values than UN, resulting in a full mirror effect.",0
4,69," The Mirror Effect that is produced by familiarity is supported by five other studies on recognition. These studies have looked at different levels of familiarity of words, names, faces, and tunes. Although the familiarity variable is referred to by different names by the different investigators, it is clear that in each study, there was a difference in initial familiarity between the two sets of items used.",0
4,70," Rouder and his colleagues have raised concerns about the legitimacy of claims linking the asymmetry of ROCs to the underlying distribution's variance. Their challenge stems from Mickes et al.'s (2007) study, which supported the relationship between slopes and variance in the unequal variance SDT model. Rouder et al. introduced z-ROCs from other models with other variances that matched Mickes et al.'s findings, but they concluded that no method exists to evaluate the relative variability of latent mnemonic strength distributions. However, Wixted and Mickes (2010) have contested this conclusion, and the controversy requires further research to resolve.",0
4,71," The authors Pratte, Rouder, and Morey (2010) are worried about a different issue that may occur when interpreting ROC asymmetries, which happens when the z-ROC slopes are less than 1.0. They fear that this phenomenon may be a result of data averaging and thus not reflect a real pattern. However, after applying a hierarchical unequal-variance signal detection model, they found that the asymmetries are indeed a real occurrence and not a distortion caused by averaging data.",0
5,1," The study of eye movement behavior has led to an interest in understanding its spatial and temporal aspects, resulting in the development of multiple new methods to compare scanpaths. In this article, the authors discuss various scanpath comparison measures that were designed to solve specific problems and require different data-processing techniques. The authors applied these methods to data from an experiment and compared their abilities to reveal similarities in scanpaths within and between individuals. The results are discussed in terms of the different aspects of scanpath behavior that each method quantifies, and the article ends with recommendations for choosing an appropriate scanpath comparison measure.",0
5,2," The methods for comparing scanpaths are explained in this article, but for further information, readers should refer to the original sources. The Appendix contains additional mathematical information.",0
5,3," The string-edit distance method is used to compare scanpaths by measuring the dissimilarity of character strings. This involves transforming one string into the other using a sequence of transformations, such as insertions, deletions, and substitutions, and counting the number of transformation steps between the two strings. A grid is overlaid on an image, and each cell in the grid is assigned a unique character for fixation sequences to be transformed into a sequence of characters. The dissimilarity of two scanpaths is then represented by the number of transformations required to convert the string corresponding to the first scanpath to the string corresponding to the second scanpath.",0
5,4," The string-edit measure was previously used on a similar dataset in a study by Foulsham and Underwood (2008). This study found that the similarity between scanpaths generated by the same person looking at the same image was the highest. Foulsham et al. (2012) also found that similarity in shape was highest for the same person looking at the same image. The string-edit distance measure is most sensitive to similarities in shape and sequential information, so it is expected that string edit similarity scores would be high between scanpaths of the same person looking at the same image for a second time. These findings are consistent with the earlier results.",0
5,5," The authors of a study proposed a way to compare eye movement patterns that improves upon the limitations of previous methods. They use a bioinformatics algorithm to align eye movement sequences and create a sequence of letters that retains fixation location, duration, and sequence information. This sequence is then compared using a substitution matrix that can incorporate semantic information and assign scores for matching letter pairs and gaps.",0
5,6," ScanMatch is anticipated to perform effectively in exposing similarities in scan patterns within a participant, incorporating information on spatial, sequential, and duration factors. It is expected to particularly highlight the similarity among observers when they view the same image twice, as demonstrated in a study by Foulsham et al. in 2012.",0
5,7, Shepherd and her colleagues (2010) came up with methods to determine how similar two scanpaths are. The scanpaths are first adjusted to have uniform time intervals and are then matched to the shorter length. These methods are based on samples and do not need pre-processing of eye-tracking data using saccade and velocity thresholds to separate fixation-saccade sequences.,0
5,8," The overlap between two scanpaths is measured using a similarity measure that captures temporal and spatial differences between fixation locations. However, this method does not consider fixation duration and instead relies on resampling to assess temporal similarity. Therefore, it preserves the order of fixations but not the differences in their durations. As a result, two scanpaths may have the same spatial positions but different fixation durations, leading to a lower similarity score. One of the drawbacks of this approach is the use of an arbitrary radius threshold, which is similar to other grid-based quantization methods like string-edit and ScanMatch.",0
5,9," Fixation overlap is greatly affected by the variation in timing of two scanpaths, while the variation in position has a lesser impact since the radius is considered. This indicates that the performance of this measure is likely to be similar to that of the ScanMatch measure, which also considers spatial and temporal similarities between scanpaths.",0
5,10," The measurement is highly sensitive to variations in time and space between the two scanpaths. This sensitivity is advantageous when timing is crucial, especially when the stimuli change over time. The correlation measurement is also sensitive to slight differences in fixation positions, without any spatial quantization of the fixations. This method uses a simple and easily understandable correlation analysis, making it more sensitive to position similarities compared to the fixation overlap method, while simultaneously considering sequential information. However, this strong spatial-temporal sensitivity may not be as reliable with noisy data as other methods that use a grid or radius.",0
5,11," The study by Shepherd and colleagues in 2010 developed a measure called gaze-shift which measures the saccade times and amplitudes between two scanpaths. The measure uses the correlation between the first derivative of each scanpath and is computed similarly to the temporal correlation, but uses the derivative instead of position.",0
5,12," The scanpaths are smoothed and their derivatives are computed using a Gaussian filter. The gaze shift depends on both the size and timing of saccades and reflects the similarity of scanpaths in terms of these features. This can help capture overall viewing strategies, as different subjects may have different patterns depending on their tendency to make large or small saccades in different areas of the visual field. The technique is useful for analyzing responses to dynamic stimuli like videos.",0
5,13," The gaze-shift measure calculates how similar amplitudes are, and this may align with the MultiMatch measure that measures likeness in the length of eye movements. Nonetheless, studies have shown that likeness in length is only consistent within/between-image comparisons. It is uncertain whether the gaze-shift measure would have a similar outcome, as it quantifies temporal similarity alongside other sample-based measures.",0
5,14," The linear distance method is advantageous because it doesn't require quantization like the string-edit method. It compares fixations based on their spatial similarity rather than order, but it may ignore sequential information. A modified version of Mannan et al.'s method enforces a one-to-one mapping between two scanpaths, but the original method averages out clusters of fixations. Linear distance compares fixation positions in two scanpaths regardless of order and has shown an advantage for within-participant similarity in previous studies.",0
5,15," Recently, a method called MultiMatch was introduced by researchers Jarodzka, Holmqvist, and Nystr??m in 2010, and Dewhurst et al. and Foulsham et al. in 2012 for comparing scanpaths. MultiMatch involves five measures that capture the similarity between different aspects of scanpaths, including shape, direction, length, position, and duration. To calculate each MultiMatch measure, the scanpath is simplified by iteratively combining successive fixations within a certain distance or directional threshold. This simplification process helps to reduce the complexity of the scanpath while maintaining its spatial and temporal structure.",0
5,16," The process starts with simplifying the scanpaths followed by an alignment based on their shape using dynamic programming. It optimizes the difference between the scanpaths, which reduces the effect of small variations and helps the algorithm find the best match. The similarity measures are then computed on these simplified and aligned scanpaths. The MultiMatch similarity computations are based on Dewhurst et al. (2012).",0
5,17," Vector similarity is a way to compare two sequences of fixations and saccades. It works by calculating the difference between aligned saccade pairs, then normalizing that difference based on the screen size. This measure is useful because it doesn't rely on pre-defined quantization, which can be limiting. Instead, it looks at spatial differences in fixation positions. The resulting value indicates how similar the two sequences are in terms of their overall shape.",0
5,18," The similarity between lengths is determined by calculating the difference between the size of the aligned saccade vectors, with respect to the diagonal of the screen, and averaging them over the scanpaths. This calculation only takes into account the size of the saccades, not their direction or duration.",0
5,19," The direction similarity is calculated by finding the difference in angle between saccades that are aligned, with the output normalized by ¦Ð and an average taken over scan paths. This measure only takes into account the direction of saccades, and not their amplitude or the location of any fixations.",0
5,20, Position similarity is determined by measuring the distance between fixations that are aligned and then normalizing the distance by the screen diagonal. This calculation takes into account both the distance and direction of saccades and is then averaged across scanpaths.,0
5,21," The duration similarity measures the difference in fixation durations between aligned fixations and normalizes it by the maximum duration, then averages it over scanpaths. This measure is not affected by the position of the fixation or the distance of the saccade.",0
5,22," The MultiMatch method has a major benefit of offering multiple measures to evaluate scanpath similarity, with each measure highlighting a unique aspect of the scanpath. However, since there are so many measures to choose from, it can be challenging to determine which measure or set of measures is most suitable for a specific situation. Additionally, since each scanpath is first simplified, it is unsure how strong each measure is against scanpath changes.",0
5,23," Considering that the MultiMatch measures have been tested before with a dataset that is quite similar to the one used in this study, we anticipate that the previous findings will be reproduced. These previous results showed that when comparing within-participant versus between-participant data, saccade direction, fixation position, fixation duration, and shape similarity were significantly greater in the former case.",0
5,24, The authors created ways to analyze gaze patterns of one person using recurrence quantification analysis. These methods are briefly mentioned and further explained in the Appendix.,0
5,25," The article discusses two fixation sequences, f and g, that are of equal length, with the longer sequence being truncated if they are of unequal length. Any two fixations, fi and gj, are considered to be cross-recurrent if their distance is below a certain threshold or if they match or are close together. The article goes on to introduce a few different measures that can be used to describe cross-recurrent patterns.",0
5,26, The cross-recurrence measure of two fixation sequences is a way of measuring how similar they are in terms of the percentage of matching fixations. This measure takes into account the spatial similarity of the two sequences and is not affected by the order in which fixations occur. Cross-recurrence is most closely aligned with measures of linear distance and position similarity.,0
5,27, The determinism measure is a way to determine how similar two scanpaths are based on the percentage of cross-recurrent points that form diagonal lines in a recurrence plot. This measure looks at the overlap of specific sequences of fixations and preserves their sequential information. It is unique in that it can show similarity between two scanpaths even if their overall shapes or fixation positions are quite different. This measure is useful because it can identify smaller sequences that may be shared between two scanpaths.,0
5,28," Laminarity measures the frequency of fixations on a specific area that occur in both scanpaths. It is related to determinism and both measures high indicate clusters of fixations in a particular region. If the laminarity is high but the determinism is low, it means that the number of fixations on a specific area was different between the two sequences. Laminarity is a measure of fixation clustering in two sequences.",0
5,29," In simple terms, the center of recurrence mass (CORM) measures the dominant lag time of cross-recurrences between fixations in two visual sequences. The CORM value is small when the same fixations in both sequences occur close in time while large CORM values indicate a significant lag between cross-recurrences. The positive or negative lag can indicate whether one sequence leads or follows the other, and the CORM value is used to determine this. The present work uses the absolute value of CORM, as there are no specific predictions about which sequence will lead or follow. Low CORM values are expected for within-image and within-participant comparisons when participants consistently lead or follow a similar scanpath closely on later viewings of the same image.",0
5,30," The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of different scanpath measures in detecting similarities and differences within and between individuals when viewing natural scenes. Participants completed a task where they first viewed the scenes and then recognized them. The researchers predicted that scanpaths of the same person viewing the same image multiple times would be more similar compared to those of different people viewing different images. To test this prediction, the researchers used several scanpath comparison techniques and evaluated their ability to capture similarities between observers and images.",0
5,31," The visual stimuli were displayed on a 19-inch monitor with a refresh rate of 60 Hz, filling the entire screen. Participants were seated 60 cm away from the monitor and their head was firmly placed in a chin rest. The viewing angle was approximately 32.7¡ã ¡Á 25.7¡ã. Eye movements were captured using the Eyelink 1000 eyetracker from SR-Research, and responses were given using a regular keyboard.",0
5,32," The researchers chose 36 images from a dataset provided by Foulsham and Underwood in 2008. The resolution of the images was 1024 ¡Á 768 pixels and they contained pictures of buildings, interiors, and landscapes. Half of the images were shown during both encoding and recognition, while the other half were only shown during recognition to serve as new images. More details can be found in Foulsham & Underwood's paper.",0
5,33, The sample-based methods involve re-sampling signals at 60 Hz. Two fixations are considered overlapping if they are less than 3.5¡ã visual angle apart for the overlap method. A temporal Gaussian filter with ¦Ò = 100 ms is applied for the gaze-shift measure. Fixations are discretized on an 8 ¡Á 6 grid for the string-edit distance measure. The substitution matrix is used for defining similarity in distance between grid locations for the ScanMatch measure. The MultiMatch measure combines fixations that are closer than 3.5¡ã visual angle or successive saccades with a difference in direction of less than 45¡ã. Two fixations are considered cross-recurrent if they are less than 1.9¡ã visual angle apart for the recurrence-based measures. A minimum line length of 2 is used for the determinism and laminarity measures.,0
5,34," Instead of simply comparing the effectiveness of different measures in detecting the main effects and interaction in the analysis of variance, the use of effect sizes was chosen. For instance, a high effect size for the main effect of image in the recurrence measure indicates its sensitivity towards this factor in assessing the similarity of scanpaths. Generalized eta squared (¦Ç2 G ) was utilized for the comparison, which is comparable across various within-participant and between-participant variables in repeated-measures designs. This allows for a direct comparison of the effects of participant and image, which cannot be done using partial eta squared (¦Ç2 p ). To assess effect size, similar guidelines were followed as that for ¦Ç2 p , where an effect size of 0.02 is considered small, 0.13 medium, and 0.26 large.",0
5,35," The article provides tables and figures that show the statistical results of measuring scanpath similarity. Table 2 presents the F-ratio and p-values for the main effects of participant, image, and participant-by-image interaction. Table 3 shows the mean scanpath similarity for each measure in the four conditions. The article then focuses on the ¦Ç2 G values obtained for each term in the analysis of variance, which are shown in Figures 1-3. Figure 4 provides the means of significant participant-by-image interactions and the corresponding post-hoc comparisons are discussed in the paragraph below.",0
5,36," The researchers conducted various types of comparisons on scanpaths created during an experiment. They used different measures to compare similarities in scanpaths across images and participants to understand the influence of individuals generating the scanpath and the stimulus on resulting similarities. Additionally, they compared methods used to compute scanpath similarity in general, and evaluated their performance based on the type of information they quantify. The study reviewed the contributions of each measure to understanding scanpath similarity in participant and image similarities.",0
5,37," The results of our study support previous research that shows when the same person looks at the same image, they are more likely to have a similar scanpath. We found that the within-image and within-participant comparison had the highest similarity scores. It's worth noting that different comparison techniques reveal different aspects of scanpath similarity.",0
5,38," The methods that were most effective in identifying unique scanning patterns within individuals were those that measured similarity in both shape and position, such as overlap, linear distance, ScanMatch, and recurrence. Interestingly, measures that also accounted for sequential order, like ScanMatch and determinism, were particularly useful in distinguishing between individuals. The determinism measure specifically revealed that some individuals have a tendency to repeat certain short scanpath sequences consistently, regardless of the image they are viewing. Overall, differences in scanning behavior can be observed in the shape and order of scanpaths.",0
5,39," The image had a strong impact on the similarity of scanpaths, which was detected by most measures. The measures that assessed the shape, position, and sequential order of the scanpaths were particularly effective in distinguishing between images. Interestingly, measures with configurable grid or radius sizes performed well in detecting these effects. It would be worthwhile to investigate the impact of different radius/grid sizes on these results in future research.",0
5,40," The study focused on the comparison of different measures computed using author-recommended or previously-used parameters. The size of the radius and granularity of the grid used in the measures could impact the results. As the radius size increases, the chance of similar spatially sensitive scanpath measures also increases. The Overlap method used a larger radius compared to recurrence-based measures, which could result in spurious similarity due to radius size. Future research could investigate the impact of multiple radius and grid sizes on scanpath quantification and comparison. A sensible radius size reflecting the size of the region of foveal or parafoveal vision is recommended based on previous studies.",0
5,41, The different methods used to compare scanpaths have varying requirements. Some methods require the scanpaths to be trimmed or resampled which may result in loss of data or the specifics of fixations and saccades. Simplification may be performed to increase processing speed but it is not necessary. Future research can investigate the effect of simplification on scanpath comparisons.,0
5,43," The choice of scanpath measure depends on the research question, but there are some general recommendations. Scanpath comparison has improved over the years, with recent advancements such as ScanMatch and MultiMatch. Cross-recurrence measures like determinism offer new ways to understand eye movement behavior. These methods represent the current state-of-the-art in scanpath comparison, but there are still many techniques being developed.",0
5,44," The methods discussed in this study are remarkable because they are accessible to anyone- they can be obtained by contacting the authors or found online for free. Certain measures, such as ScanMatch and MultiMatch, come with user-friendly interfaces and tutorials which make them easier to use. A list of URLs where these available methods can be found is given below.",0
5,45," The researchers compared various scanpath comparison measures by applying them to one data set and evaluating their ability to reveal differences in scanning behavior across participants and images as well as the aspects of scanpaths that they quantify. The purpose of this analysis was to provide a framework for other researchers to determine which comparison technique is the most suitable for their application. The hope is that this overview and results will assist those interested in studying eye movement behavior, specifically the spatial and sequential aspects of it.",0
6,1," The article examines various studies that looked at interventions for inappropriate sexual behavior in children and teenagers with developmental disabilities. The searches resulted in 12 studies that met the necessary criteria, and each one was summarized according to specific aspects. All 12 studies showcased a decrease in the target behavior as a result of the intervention. The most common intervention method utilized multi-component behavioral strategies. Finally, the article concludes by discussing potential clinical implications and future research suggestions.",0
6,2," The exploration of sexuality, including masturbation, is a normal part of human sexual behavior during prepubescent years. Masturbation behavior can occur as early as in the womb and during childhood. Masturbation commonly occurs at four years old and during adolescence. The context in which the behavior occurs, cultural and familial norms, and developmental stages should be considered in defining normal or abnormal sexual behavior. Masturbation in a private setting and not excessive is considered normal. However, sustained or public masturbation may require intervention.",0
6,3," Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) tend to exhibit inappropriate sexual behaviors, including public masturbation, fetishistic behavior, and inappropriate touching of others. There are several reasons for this behavior, including a lack of sex education for individuals with disabilities, the predisposition of those with ASD to engage in self-stimulatory behavior, and difficulties in acquiring social and behavioral skills. Children with ASD may have difficulty distinguishing between public and private settings and may struggle with understanding appropriate behaviors in social relationships. Attention from others in response to their inappropriate behaviors may also reinforce this behavior.",0
6,4," The meaning of ISB is not unanimously agreed upon in the literature. However, based on existing research, ISB is defined as sexual behaviors that are excessive, obsessive, occur in public, violate others, are aggressive in nature, and/or imitate adult acts that are socially inappropriate.",0
6,5," When people engage in inappropriate sexual behavior, it can have profound effects on their relationships with family and community. Parents of children with disabilities often express concern about their child's behavior and may seek advice on how to address it. However, there is limited research on the treatment of childhood masturbation and even less on ISB among children with developmental disabilities. As a result, there is little agreement among clinicians on the best approach for treating ISB, and the services available in this area are often limited.",0
6,6," Mallants and Casteels (2008) reviewed literature on assessment and treatment strategies for childhood masturbation in typically developing children. They suggest starting with an assessment that considers the child's development, behavior, medical history, cultural background, and more. If the assessment reveals no underlying issues, the authors recommend educating parents and providing support rather than punishment for the child's behavior. Additionally, children should receive developmentally appropriate sex education to help them understand appropriate sexual behaviors.",0
6,7," Besides the recommendations given by Tarnai in 2006, other studies indicate that treatment for Inappropriate Sexual Behavior (ISB) in people with disabilities should involve providing them with sex education that is tailored to their specific needs. Koller, for instance, suggests that sex education for those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) should be brief, repetitive, and explicit. This education should also include disciplines on appropriate sexual behavior, response to unacceptable behavior, and scheduling of personal time for sexual activity.",0
6,8," Although it is beneficial to provide sex education for children who have disabilities, it is apparent that more research needs to be done to establish evidence-based practices. Schaafsma and colleagues(2013) investigated the creation of sex education programs for individuals with intellectual disabilities and found that the programs lacked clear objectives, did not have a solid theoretical foundation, had not undergone a proper evaluation, and were not developed by consulting relevant groups.",0
6,9," Understanding the life course trajectory of ISB is crucial. It can significantly affect the development of relationships, social participation, and education settings in early childhood and prepubescence. If ISB persists in adulthood, it can also impact the formation of social and intimate relationships, home living, and community integration. Without appropriate treatment, children with ISB may be at risk of sexual abuse, which is a concern given the higher risk for sexual violence that children with disabilities face.",0

They combined search terms such as Bmasturbation, Bsexual behavior, and Bgenital stimulation with Bautism, BASD, Bdisabilities, Bdevelopmental disabilities, and Bintellectual disabilities. The PubMed search produced the highest number of results, with 122 articles. They conducted ancestry searches of each article found and also searched Google Scholar using the same search terms but found no additional articles. All identified articles were examined to determine if they met criteria for inclusion in the review.",0

6,17," The studies in this paper were evaluated based on their treatment effects, which were categorized as positive, negative, or mixed following the method outlined in the Mulloy et al. (2010) review. Positive effects were seen when all participants in within-subject studies had positive outcomes or when group studies showed significant differences between treatment and control groups. Mixed effects were recorded when some individuals benefited from treatment while others did not, or when positive outcomes were observed for some but not all measures. Negative effects were observed when no positive effects were seen in a within-group design, or when group differences were not statistically significant in studies using a between-groups design.",0
6,18," The study found 18 articles that could potentially be included in the review. To make sure the database search was accurate, the first and second authors reviewed each article and agreed that only 12 of them met the criteria for the review.

6,25," Three studies utilized medication to treat inappropriate sexual behavior, specifically by prescribing mirtazapine, a type of antidepressant that may cause sexual dysfunction. Mirtazapine is commonly used in treating clinical depression among adults and the elderly, and has also been suggested to alleviate symptoms of ASD and other pervasive developmental disorders. Coskun et al. (2009) chose mirtazapine for its potential antilibidal effects.",0
6,26," In 9 out of 12 studies, public masturbation was identified as a behavior that needed to be addressed through treatment. Some of these studies also included the public display of genitalia. Three studies also included inappropriate and uninvited sexual touching of another person as a target behavior. In two studies that provided group intervention, several target behaviors were identified, including uninvited and inappropriate sexual touching of another person, public self-stimulatory behavior, exhibitionist behavior, and the inappropriate and public use of sexual language. Target behaviors in another study included public masturbation, inappropriate touching of others, public disrobing, arousal resulting from specific body parts or inanimate objects, and observation of others disrobing or bathing.",0

6,40," The research has several limitations that need further analysis. Most of the studies have suggestive levels of certainty, while only one reached a conclusive level. One of the primary causes of this is the experimental design used in the studies, which includes a single-case AB research design used in many studies examined in this review. Using an AB design and other limitations in the studies make it difficult to conclude that the positive treatment effects reported occurred as a result of intervention. Although implementing a reversal design for behaviors of this nature can be unethical, further research is necessary to determine the true effectiveness of the treatments.",0
6,42," The study's design limitations and the small number of participants in each study could affect the validity of the findings and make it hard to apply the study results across different groups. While some studies used a multiple baseline design which strengthened the research, most studies only had one participant.",0
6,43," The studies that used behavioral treatment also included time sample and frequency recordings to gather IOA data. Many studies, like Barmann et al. (1981), Cook et al. (1978), Foxx et al. (1986), Fyffe et al. (2004), Luiselli et al. (1977), and Polvinale and Lutzker (1980), used these methods, and as a result, they became highly certain and effective approaches to intervene with ISB.",0
6,44," Despite a change in how society views the sexual behavior of people with developmental disabilities, treatment for ISB has not changed much between 1977 and 2009. Most treatments used during this time rely on applied behavior analysis, although there have been a few recent studies that have explored the use of medication as a treatment option. However, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks of relying solely on medication as a treatment without also teaching individuals how to manage their behavior over the long term.",0
6,45," It is crucial to take into account the effect of learning to control impulsive and aggressive behavior not only in direct terms of clinical implications but also in terms of its effects on the home and the community for children and adolescents with developmental disabilities. The impact of such behavior can have consequences on social relationships with family, friends, and school inclusion, which hinders community access and engagement. Therefore, it is necessary to develop interventions that teach functional alternatives that can be applied in various settings and to different people.",0
6,46, The studies conducted had very few female participants and it's important to note that there may be gender differences in sexual behavior. There is little research on how ISB differs between males and females but it's suggested that social and cultural factors and anatomical differences may lead to bias in treating males more frequently than females. The lack of research in this area leads to difficulty in drawing conclusions about any gender differences in ISB expression and response to treatment. This raises questions about whether there are differences in rates and manifestation of ISB between males and females.,0
7,2," Over time, there has been a change in perspective regarding sexual behavior displayed by those with disabilities. While it is no longer considered abnormal behavior, there are still some concerns with regards to the timing, appropriateness, and location of such behavior. However, there has been insufficient research done on treatments for individuals with developmental disabilities who display inappropriate sexual behavior. Conducting more thorough research can lead to better understandings and implementation of evidence-based treatments that can improve social and developmental outcomes for this population.",0
7,4," It is crucially important to understand the significance of testing as a learning tool, especially with the increasing implementation of high-stakes testing in education. The impact of information learned during testing versus studying the material is particularly intriguing. While testing has its benefits, such as better retention of information, there are also negative consequences, such as impaired retrieval of other items from a set and decreasing performance over the course of a test list. This decrease in performance is referred to as output interference and can be attributed to the updating of existing memories or the addition of new traces to episodic memory during testing.",0
7,5," The Annis et al. (2013) study showed that using semantic memory did not increase OI in an episodic task. However, this does not address whether OI occurs within a semantic task. While the two memory systems have different functions and structures, they rely on each other heavily. Episodic memory benefits from semantic information, and vice versa. Semantic knowledge starts as episodic but becomes more generalized over time. This creates a lasting, resistant semantic memory that is less prone to interference from episodic events.",0
7,6, The researchers used a Bayesian multiple linear regression developed by Kruschke (2011) and cross-checked it with a frequentist regression to analyze test performance. They chose this approach because it allowed them to determine the amount of evidence in favor or against a null effect. The researchers focused on the change in performance over test trials and examined whether there was a nonzero slope for performance change. They also investigated whether the slope of performance across trials changed from Test 1 to Test 2. The interpretation of the Bayesian model parameters was the same as that of a typical regression from the frequentist tradition.,0
7,7," The 150 test trials for each participant were divided into ten blocks, consisting of fifteen trials each. The standardized performance data for each block, the block number, and whether it was Test 1 or Test 2 were entered into a regression model, along with the interaction between block number and test number.",0
7,9," The Savage-Dickey method involves comparing the likelihood of observing a zero slope in the posterior distribution to that of the prior distribution. A Bayes Factor (B01) less than 1 indicates that a zero slope is more likely in the prior distribution and supports the null hypothesis. On the other hand, a BF greater than 1 supports the alternative hypothesis that the slope is nonzero. These analyses were conducted using the JAGS software and Brjags package in R.",0
7,10," The results for Test 1 and Test 2 are presented in Fig. 2, and the data shows that performance on Test 1 is consistent throughout successive trials, while performance on Test 2 decreases with each trial. The profile plot in Fig. 2a illustrates the performance for a given test block of Test 1. The interaction term between the two tests indicated that Test 2 had a higher value (¦Â = -.007, 95% HDI: -.013, -.0004) and there was strong evidence that Test 2 performance declined over the test block while Test 1 remained consistent. There was some support for a difference between the slopes of the two tests.",0
7,11," The reason for the observed OI in Test 2 could be a combination of searching for knowledge and recent memory, with the latter being more influenced by OI. To test this theory, the accuracy of the Test 1 response was evaluated, and if it was correct, OI may not be observed. However, if the response was incorrect, participants may generate a correct Test 2 response on occasion by guessing or using successful semantic memory search. The use of episodic memory for Test 1 feedback to generate a correct Test 2 response is also possible, as Test 2 accuracy was significantly higher. Under these circumstances, OI should be observed.",0
7,12," The results in Fig. 3a show that when participants correctly answered a question in Test 1, their performance on Test 2 remained consistent across test position. On the other hand, when they answered incorrectly on Test 1, their performance on Test 2 decreased greatly across test position, as shown in Fig. 3b. The Bayesian analysis confirmed these patterns, with a positive interaction term indicating a steeper slope for Test 2 when Test 1 was answered incorrectly. The slope for Test 2 when Test 1 was answered correctly was flat, with evidence for both zero and nonzero values. Therefore, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected or accepted in this case.",0
7,13," The results obtained from Bayesian analysis were supported by a frequentist multiple regression on the data combined from all participants. Test Block and Test 1 accuracy were found to have a significant impact on performance, and the change in performance across Test Block for Test 2 was influenced by the correctness of Test 1 response. When Test 1 response was correct, the slope of change was lower than when it was incorrect.",0
7,14," The way participants responded to a set of questions changed based on whether it was the first or second time they had answered the questions. During the first test, there was no pattern of output interference (OI) observed, meaning participants were likely relying on their semantic memory. During the second test, after receiving corrective feedback, there was a strong OI effect observed, particularly for questions that were answered incorrectly during the first test. This suggests that participants were relying on their episodic memory, which resulted in more OI.",0
7,15," Based on the data, it seems that people rely on two types of memory- episodic and semantic- to answer questions correctly. Episodic memory may be more likely to be affected by testing conditions, while semantic memory is less vulnerable. Interestingly, trying to remember the context of how information was learned, as often recommended by textbooks, might actually be harmful for tests that measure knowledge. This is because focusing too much on context can cause interference from other information that is similar to the context being recalled.",0
7,16," To put it simply, we discovered that OI does not affect continuous knowledge searches when using a group of common knowledge questions. However, OI remained strong when participants used corrective feedback given during Test 1, indicating that episodic information may have an impact on semantic memory. These results offer restrictions on the connection between episodic and semantic memory.",0
8,1," The current issue of Psychological Studies is published to coincide with two significant events reflecting the progress and development of psychology as a field of study and research. Firstly, Calcutta University is commemorating the centenary of Psychology Department established in 1915. Secondly, this journal is celebrating the completion of 60 years of its publication. Both these occasions demonstrate the advancement and growth of psychology in India over the last century. The editor of this journal, who has completed 15 years, acknowledges the challenging and rewarding experience of editing this journal with consistent and collaborative effort by the scholars' community. Due to personal reasons, the editor finds it difficult to continue and therefore resigns from the post, expressing gratitude to NAOP officials and the community for the trust and support shown. The editorial, administrative and production team have contributed significantly towards journal publication.",0
8,2," In recent years, there has been a significant growth in the field of psychology in various aspects such as theory development, research, and practical applications. Although subfields such as psychometric, clinical, and organizational psychology still receive a substantial amount of research attention, there is a small yet robust group of researchers who are changing their research agenda by embracing indigenous concepts and methods. This shift demonstrates a greater cultural awareness in their choice of research topics and problems.",0
8,4," The current issue of Psychological Studies includes an interesting article on diversity and presentism in psychology by Adrian Brock, which is followed by comments from various scholars. The discussion aims to contextualize psychology in socio-historical and cultural settings, while other articles in the issue focus on issues in the Indian context. The overall goal is to promote cultural awareness in psychological discourse.",0
8,5," When the writer reflects on their past time as an editor, their only regret is not being able to be more innovative with handling manuscripts. While they attempted to reduce publication lag, they believe there is potential for improvement in the process. The support from their colleagues has made the publication procedure easier, however. The writer is confident that the new editor, Professor Damodar Suar, will do a great job and continue to promote psychology. They welcome him and his team, wishing him success in his new role.",0
9,1," The research suggests that while retrospective studies show crying can be beneficial for improving mood, laboratory studies consistently report negative effects on mood. The study aimed to explain this paradox by evaluating the mood of criers and non-criers after watching an emotional movie in a laboratory setting. It was found that criers experienced an initial negative mood increase, followed by a recovery that led to an improvement in mood compared to pre-film levels. This suggests that crying can lead to more long-term mood recovery.",0
9,2," Humans are the only species that have the ability to cry emotional tears, which is a widely observed behavior across various cultures. Despite its prevalence, research on the functions of crying has been limited. Theories on the functions of crying can be categorized into two categories - the catharsis effect which emphasizes the personal benefits of crying, and the inter-individual functions of crying which focus on communicating one's helplessness and need for support. Both positions are not mutually exclusive, and crying may be considered as a coping behavior that serves several functions, from facilitating emotional recovery to persuading others to act on the situation.",0
9,3," The discrepancies in findings about the effects of crying may be due to the methodology used in retrospective studies, where participants choose which crying episodes to describe. This may lead to a bias towards reporting crying experiences that support the idea that crying makes one feel better. Another issue is the lack of a precise definition of the time interval between crying and reported feelings. Participants are asked to report how they feel after crying, without specifying the time frame. However, it is possible that people experience a dip in their mood immediately after crying, followed by an improvement, but we currently have insufficient information to understand this process.",0
9,4," The study aims to investigate the immediate and delayed effects of crying on mood in a controlled laboratory environment. To ensure the results are applicable to a wide group of people, stimuli that elicit tears for negative and positive emotions were used. The study predicts that negative mood would be more prominent in individuals who cry after potentially emotional films. The study also anticipates that individuals who cry would experience a greater improvement in mood compared to those who did not cry, in terms of both initial mood downturns and overall mood improvement. Finally, the researchers expect a relationship between the frequency of crying and changes in negative affect.",0
9,5," The study began with 46 female and 26 male students, who were between the ages of 19 and 33, with an average age of 23.80 and a standard deviation of 3.19. All participants agreed to take part in the study and signed informed consent forms. However, six participants were removed from the study due to incomplete or missing data from equipment failure or incomplete questionnaires.",0
9,6," The researchers used a shortened Emotional States Scale to measure negative affect (NA), which included 18 items rated on a five-point Likert scale. The items evaluated a range of emotions such as anxiety, sadness and anger, and the scale demonstrated good internal consistency.",0
9,7," The participants were placed in a soundproof room with a monitor, speakers, and video camera. They completed a mood rating before being randomly assigned to watch one of two films. After watching the film, they filled out a questionnaire about their emotional response. They completed two more mood ratings and additional questionnaires before leaving the lab. They were instructed to complete a final mood rating after receiving an SMS message on their mobile phone, without any further instructions for behavior during the 60 minutes prior to this rating. The results were sent to the experimenter via text message.",0
9,8," The study conducted several statistical tests, including independent samples t tests, Chi square tests, and Pearson correlation coefficients, to investigate the relationships between relevant variables and to identify any potential confounding variables that needed to be controlled for. To compare changes in negative affect (NA) between participants who cried and those who did not cry, a mixed ANOVA was conducted with time period, group, age, and gender as factors. The changes within groups and specific measurements were analyzed, and an additional ANOVA was conducted to validate the possibility that low mood in criers stimulated successful mood enhancing behaviors. Bonferroni post hoc tests were also used.",0
9,10," The study found that there was a significant difference in mood changes over time and a significant interaction between time and group, indicating that the crying and noncrying groups had different patterns of mood changes. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups overall. This supports the hypothesis of different emotional responses to crying.",0
9,11," The researchers conducted two separate ANOVAs to determine whether there was a significant change in mood in each of the two groups. They found that there was no significant change in the group of non-criers throughout the four measurements, but in the group of criers, there was a significant effect of time. Post-hoc comparisons showed that NA increased from T1 to T2 and decreased from T2 to T3 and T4, supporting their initial hypothesis. They also found a significant decrease in NA from T1 to T4 in the criers group, indicating overall mood improvement following crying. Finally, the predicted decreases in NA remained significant when NA change from T1 to T2 was included as a covariate in an additional ANOVA.",0
9,13," The idea that crying brings relief is possibly due to the strong improvement in mood experienced by those who cry. The decrease in negative affect (NA) in these individuals may be attributed to the return to baseline levels after initial increases. This suggests that people may feel better after crying, despite an initial deterioration in mood. These findings support the hypothesis that crying has cathartic effects and are in line with previous research on the effects of emotion expression on mood and well-being. However, it remains unclear if the long-term mood-enhancing effects of crying are due to the same mechanisms.",0
9,14," The decrease in negative affect (NA) at the final measurement reported by those who cried could be argued to be caused by the increased tension and nervousness that participants experienced at the beginning of the study. This is because they were in a new and unfamiliar situation. However, it is unclear why noncriers did not experience an improvement in mood at the final measurement. Furthermore, both groups had similar levels of NA at the beginning of the study.",0
9,15," The researchers are uncertain whether the decrease in NA is due to a change in mood caused by crying or a shift in how the participants perceive their emotional state. This response shift is a known phenomenon among cancer patients who often report an improved quality of life after their diagnosis, but a retrospective comparison reveals a decreased quality of life. Future studies should consider this methodological issue by directly comparing participants' current mood state to their pre-film measurement and considering factors that influence memory of emotional events and mood regulation processes.",0
9,16," The findings suggest that there is a straightforward explanation for why different studies on crying and mood show contradicting results. Although crying initially causes a drop in mood in laboratory settings, it eventually leads to an improvement in mood that exceeds the original level. This aligns with retrospective studies on the topic.",0
10,1," The connection between incentive information and improved cognitive control may not only be due to temporary brain responses to potential rewards. There is evidence that information about rewards can influence cognitive processing and brain activity throughout the task, in a more consistent manner. Recent research has found that motivation-related state effects can impact cognitive function, demonstrated by increased sustained activations across blocks of trials with incentive information. This suggests that rewards can enhance cognitive control through both cue-related responses and sustained responses.",0
10,2," According to research, offering rewards or incentives may not affect behavioral performance and brain activity in everyone. This is because individual differences in reward-related sensitivity can affect how people respond to both primary and secondary rewards. Various studies have found a link between personality traits related to reward drive and neural responses to rewards. For instance, some studies have found that people with higher scores on measures of behavior inhibition and approach are more likely to show greater neural responses to appetizing foods in certain regions of the brain, while those higher in extraversion tend to show greater neural responses to monetary rewards. Overall, understanding these individual differences in reward sensitivity may be important for predicting how people will respond to incentives and make decisions.",0
10,3," Another personality trait that affects reward processing is anhedonia, which is the reduced ability to feel pleasure. Experiencing rewards as positive or pleasurable is crucial for individuals to approach their goals and maintain positive emotions. Individual differences in anhedonia are present in both clinical and nonclinical populations, and those who find rewards less pleasurable are less motivated to change their behavior to achieve them. People who report higher anhedonia levels may have less improvement in cognitive control, less modulation for incentive-related brain activity, or potentially both.",0
10,4," The study aimed to replicate previous research on how rewards improve cognitive control and examined sustained and incentive cue-related effects on cognitive control using fMRI. The focus was on the DLPFC and striatum due to their previous involvement in the influence of rewards on cognitive control. The response conflict processing task was modified to fit a mixed state-item design, allowing for examinations of sustained context-dependent effects and transient reward-related cue effects. Participants performed in baseline conditions before additional reward blocks where they could win money on some trials. The study predicted that motivational states induced by reward contexts would produce greater sustained activity in the DLPFC than in nonincentive baseline blocks and that incentive cues would generate increased transient neural activity in both reward-related cortical and subcortical regions.",0
10,5," The researchers had two goals for their study. First, they wanted to see if receiving rewards would improve cognitive control, and if so, how it would affect the brain's activity. Second, they wanted to test if the level of self-reported anhedonia (lack of pleasure or enjoyment) in individuals would have an impact on how rewards improved cognitive control and brain activity. They used two measures of trait anhedonia to assess this.",0
10,6, The individuals who took part in the study did not have any prior psychiatric or neurological conditions in themselves or their family history. They were recruited from the Conte Center for the Neuroscience of Mental Disorders at Washington University and agreed to participate by providing written consent. The ethics board at the university approved the study protocol. Participants were compensated with up to $20 as a reward for their performance and an additional $25 per hour for completing the experiment.,0
10,7," The baseline blocks consisted of two runs with 18 trials per trial type, intermixed with congruent, incongruent, and neutral trials. BTASK and BDONE cues were presented at the start and end of each task block for 2 seconds, respectively. Each trial began with a BXX cue for 1 second, followed by a fixation period ranging from 2 to 6 seconds before the onset of stimuli. Participants responded to the target stimulus within 0.5 seconds, followed by visual feedback for 1 second. ITI ranged from 2 to 6 seconds.",0
10,8," Participants completed four additional runs where they had the chance to win money for correct and fast responses. A reaction time threshold was determined individually for each person based on their second baseline run. During these runs, some trials were preceded by a reward cue indicating points could be earned, while others had no potential for reward. Participants received feedback on their point earnings and their accumulated points were converted into real money.",0
10,9," The imaging data was analyzed and processed using software developed by Washington University called the FIDL analysis package. The first four images of each run were not used to allow for signal stabilization. The functional-imaging data preprocessing involved various steps: slice-dependent time shift correction, removal of the first four images of each run, elimination of odd/even slice intensity differences due to interpolated acquisition, realignment of data to compensate for rigid-body motion, image intensity normalization, registration of the 3-D structural volume to the atlas template in the Talairach coordinate system, coregistration of the fMRI volume to the structural image, transformation of fMRI data to voxel atlas space, and spatial smoothing. Head movement during scanning was assessed by using the output of the rigid-body rotation and translation algorithm, and if the standard deviation of the root-mean-square movement exceeded 20, the BOLD runs were not included in the analysis.",0
10,10, The researchers conducted multiple ANOVAs to assess response time and accuracy in different trial types and reward conditions. They then used post-hoc paired t-tests to further investigate significant interactions. The team calculated two behavioral indices to measure the effects of reward context and cue on response time. They used these indices to perform a Pearson correlation analysis to investigate the relationship between individual differences in anhedonia trait and how rewards impact cognitive tasks.,0
10,11, The researchers used different statistical methods to analyze the data. They looked at sustained estimates and cue-related activity separately. They focused on regions that showed interactions with time points and used post-hoc ANOVAs and ttests to further analyze these regions. They extracted mean percent signal change for each time point to visualize the pattern of activity. They focused on Time Point 4 for the statistical analyses because it corresponded to the initial peak in the hemodynamic response. They conducted post-hoc paired ttests to compare the three trial types and parse the significant effects.,0
10,12," The researchers conducted two different ANOVAs to analyze the relationship between targets and rewards. The first ANOVA looked at target activation across trials with the potential to earn reward, while disregarding the trial type. A post-hoc analysis was conducted on any significant findings. The second ANOVA included trial type and compared target activation across trials with the potential to earn reward in the reward context. Factors such as Reward Context, Trial Type, and Time Point were taken into consideration in this analysis. This was an attempt to replicate prior research from Padmala and Pessoa (2011).",0
10,13," The authors limited their examination to specific brain regions known to be involved in the processing of reward, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and basal ganglia (BG). They used established anatomical markers to create masks of voxels within these regions and conducted voxel-by-voxel analysis within them. To ensure accurate results, statistical activation maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using combined p-value and cluster thresholds. The DLPFC mask included Brodmann's areas 9 and 46, while the BG mask combined several structures. Follow-up analyses were conducted by extracting BOLD response values and importing them for further correlation analysis.",0
10,14," The study investigated if differences in anhedonia influenced both behavior and brain function when rewards were presented. They examined specific regions of the brain that showed sustained and transient effects as well as the relationship between individual differences in anhedonia and brain activation during reward and cue contexts. The researchers also looked at two specific measures of anhedonia and their correlation with brain-personality traits, which were corrected using small volume procedures.",0
10,15," The ANOVA analysis showed that trial type had a significant impact on the error data, with more errors on incongruent trials than on congruent ones. However, there was no significant effect of reward on the error data and no interaction effect between reward and trial type. Therefore, further analyses were conducted on the RT data.",0
10,16," The study found that individuals who reported more anhedonia (the inability to feel pleasure) on the Chapman scales had lower levels of activation in the lateral globus pallidus when presented with cues predicting rewards. On the other hand, those who reported higher levels of hedonic tone on the SHPS had greater activation in the same region when presented with similar cues. However, the correlation for hedonic tone did not pass the Bonferroni correction.",0
10,17," The study found that certain regions in the brain showed different patterns of activation in response to reward-related tasks. Some regions in the DLPFC and BG showed reduced activation on RC trials compared to RCXT and BCXT trials. Other regions in the DLPFC showed greater activation on RC trials relative to BCXT trials. Subcortical regions showed no difference in activation among reward-related tasks at Time Point 4, but showed greater deactivation on RC trials at Time Point 7.",0
10,18," The study found that the DLPFC and several subcortical regions, such as the lateral globus pallidus and caudate, showed increased activation in response to incentive cues compared to no-incentive cues. These findings are consistent with previous research that found an increase in activation in regions associated with cognitive control in response to incentive cues.",0
10,19," The DLPFC is typically viewed as a fundamental element of cognitive control, but recent evidence suggests that it also encodes both reward-related and task-related value information. Moreover, research has shown that the DLPFC is strongly linked to essential regions that are involved in value representations, such as the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. Additionally, the DLPFC sends projections to the BG, which includes the caudate nucleus and the globus pallidus, and these striatal regions send back projections to the thalamus, which in turn projects to the DLPFC, premotor and motor cortices. As a result, the increased activations observed in the DLPFC and striatum in response to incentive cues may show improved neural representations of reward value via top-down control of activations in this circuit.",0
10,20," The study found that certain areas in the brain show sustained activity during reward contexts, which extends previous research suggesting that regions in a fronto-parietal network can exhibit sustained increase in response to reward information. The present study used a hypothesis-driven analysis approach that may have offered greater power to detect sustained effects in the prefrontal and striatal regions. The sustained activity observed in the BG may reflect its role in reward-based learning and goal-directed behavior. The increased activity in the dorsal striatum during reward contexts may represent increased effort to maintain reward-related information, which can facilitate preparatory responses throughout reward contexts.",0
10,21," In this study, we discovered that individuals with greater anhedonia had lower neural activation in response to reward-predicting cues. However, there was no significant connection between anhedonia and sustained, context-dependent activation in reward contexts. These results suggest that anhedonia may affect how rewards impact brain activation and behavior in response to explicit reward cues, but it does not seem to influence more comprehensive incentive effects. Additionally, these findings suggest that anhedonia may affect goal-directed behavior by making it more challenging to pursue rewards due to a lack of positive experiences or expectations.",0
10,22," The study provided insight into one possible neural mechanism that causes anhedonia, but there were some limitations. The study did not find any significant reductions in conflict effects, although there was a speeding in RT in relation to reward. The study focused on the DLPFC and basal ganglia, and the analysis did not show any significant regions displaying interaction effects. Future studies are required to understand how the difficulty level of tasks affects the engagement of the DLPFC in reward contexts. The study also found that self-reported anhedonia trait in healthy adults had transient neural activity during reward predictions linked to the lateral globus pallidus, but not with sustained DLPFC activity.",0
10,23," The study had a limitation in that the fixed-order presentation of the conditions could have led to practice-related effects influencing the sustained context-dependent effect. However, previous empirical evidence, such as the findings from Chiew and Braver's study, suggests that this is unlikely. Chiew and Braver used a similar design with randomized incentive trials and found that practice effects disappeared after the first epoch, whereas incentive effects remained. Therefore, the differences between the reward conditions in this study are unlikely to be due to practice effects. Additionally, the interleaved RCXT and RC trials could not have been affected by practice effects.",0
10,24," The current study was able to differentiate between prolonged and immediate effects of rewards. However, future research could use other methods to distinguish these effects further. The study design used did not show the impact of continued rewards in the ability to provide incentives for improved performance throughout a block of trials. Therefore, a future study could include conditions where participants are notified of a bonus at the end of a set of trials for an overall increase in performance, but without individualized trial reward cues. Using this manipulation would create a design that would display both a general, sustained effect of an incentive in comparison to the presence or absence of transient reward cues.",0
10,25, The funding for this research came from National Institute of Mental Health Grant Number R01-MH066031. The authors do not have any financial interests or potential conflicts of interest. The Cognitive Control and Psychopathology Laboratory members and study participants are appreciated for their contribution in making this study possible.,0
11,1," The study followed 74 children with Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified for 7 years. The researchers examined the rates and stability of comorbid psychiatric disorders using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children: Parent version at ages 6-12 and then again at ages 12-20. They also looked at childhood factors that predicted the stability of these psychiatric disorders. The study found that the rate of comorbid psychiatric disorders decreased from childhood to adolescence, and that behaviors like stereotyped behaviors and reduced social interest predicted the stability of these disorders. The study suggests that clinical practice should consider re-evaluating psychiatric comorbidity since some individuals shifted in their comorbid diagnoses.",0
11,3," The study participants were required to meet two inclusion criteria. Firstly, they should have met the research criteria for PDD-NOS in childhood, as outlined in previous studies. Secondly, their parents needed to have taken part in the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children: Parent version during their childhood and again seven years later during adolescence. The study involved 94 participants during childhood and 74 participants during adolescence. The average time between the two interviews was around 7 years and took place when the participants were 6-12 years old and 12-20 years old, respectively.",0
11,4," 74 individuals who had both parents participate in the study did not differ from those with only one parent participating in terms of their gender, age, nationality, socio-economic status, and number of DISC-IV diagnoses. However, those with both parents participating had higher IQ scores than those with only one parent participating.",0
11,5," The DISC-IV-P is a tool used to assess psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents through a structured parent interview. Trained research assistants conducted interviews with parents via phone. The DISC-IV-P measures internalizing disorders (anxiety and mood disorders) and externalizing disorders (disruptive disorders) using internet software. The anxiety disorder module includes nine disorders, while the mood disorder module includes three. The disruptive behavior category is further divided into ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, and CD.",0
11,6," The study used a parental questionnaire called the CSBQ, which has 49 items scored on a three-point scale measuring characteristics typical of autism spectrum disorder. The questionnaire has six subscales and has been found to have good reliability and consistency. The study aimed to investigate whether the level and type of parent-rated ASD symptoms in childhood were associated with the stability of comorbidity.",0
11,7, The study used the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) to investigate if IQ scores in childhood were linked to the stability of comorbidity. The WISC-R has a verbal scale (VIQ) and a performance scale (PIQ) to make up the total scale (TIQ). The Dutch version of the WISC-R has been proven to be reliable and valid.,0
11,8," The researchers used a questionnaire given to parents to evaluate the use of mental health care and medication between two waves of the study. The questionnaire contained eight questions pertaining to mental health care and was scored with a 0 or 1 depending on whether it was used or not. If any of those items were scored as 1, the child was considered to have received mental health care. In addition, parents were asked about their child's use of psychotropic medication in the past two weeks, which was also scored with a 0 or 1.",0
11,9," Firstly, the rates of having multiple psychiatric disorders at two different time points were calculated and tested for significance using statistical methods. Then, a table was created to examine if these disorders remained stable from childhood to adolescence, and whether they were specific to certain domains. The results were also presented graphically to better understand the patterns of stability and change.",0
11,10," The study aimed to investigate whether factors such as gender, age, IQ, level and type of parent-rated ASD symptoms, intermediate mental health care and medication were related to the stability of psychiatric disorders. The research compared groups with persistent disorders, those who changed from disorder to no disorder, persistent absence of disorders and those who changed from no disorder to disorder. T-tests and Chi Square tests were used for continuous and categorical variables respectively. Nonparametric testing was used for smaller groups using Mann-Whitney U test and Binomial test.",0
11,11," The diagram in Figure 1 displays the percentages of individuals who fall under different groups based on their psychiatric conditions in childhood and adolescence. Among those with comorbid psychiatric disorders in childhood, 63% still had the conditions in adolescence, while 37% no longer did. Similarly, half of those without psychiatric disorders in childhood continued to be free of such disorders in adolescence, but the other half developed at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder.",0
11,12," To gain more clarity on the research findings, an additional test was conducted to determine potential predictors that are specific for persistent externalizing disorders as opposed to persistent internalizing disorders. The test showed that in both cases, only stereotyped behavior reported by parents was a significant factor that predicted the persistence of the same psychiatric comorbidities. This was evidenced by statistically significant results for both externalizing disorders (t(40) = -2.953, p = .005) and internalizing disorders (t(39) = -3.287, p = .002).",0
11,13," The study compared the childhood traits of two groups known as ""persistent absence"" and ""absent to present"" in terms of factors linked to the stability of coexisting psychiatric disorders. However, no significant distinctions were identified in terms of age, gender, IQ, the degree or type of ASD symptoms, intermediate mental healthcare, or the use of psychotropic medication.",0
11,14," The incidence of MDD rises slightly from childhood to adolescence, going from 8% to 11%. These values are consistent with what is known in the literature, although there have been reported higher rates (up to 16%) and lower rates (as low as 1%) in individuals with ASD. There is also an increase in depression from childhood to adolescence in the general population, indicating a comparable developmental process.",0
11,15," The prevalence of ADHD comorbidity decreases as individuals with PDD-NOS transition from childhood to adolescence, although relatively high rates are still observed. The hyperactivity and combined types of ADHD decrease while the inattentive type increases in adolescence. This change aligns with the expected trajectory of ADHD development, with attentional demands in adolescence potentially amplifying previously unnoticed problems. Lower rates of ADHD comorbidity have been reported for individuals with ASD in other studies.",0
11,16," The overall occurrence of multiple psychiatric disorders reported by parents decreases between childhood and adolescence. Differences in methodological approaches, including diagnosis and sampling, could explain variation in the frequency of comorbidities in various studies. Our own research shows that the conversion from one kind of comorbidity to another is limited. There is little indication of cross-domain transitions, and domain stability seems to be the most consistent pattern. However, our dataset has limitations.",0
11,17," The study found that children with stable psychiatric comorbidity had higher levels of parent-reported stereotyped behavior and reduced contact and social interest. These behaviors were also predictive of the persistent presence of either internalizing or externalizing disorders. However, the study did not find any significant predictors for the persistent absence of comorbidity. The findings suggest that parent-reported stereotyped behaviors might be an indication for persistent comorbidity. Future research is needed to confirm these findings.",0
11,19," The children in our research were diagnosed with PDD-NOS, but it is unclear how these results relate to individuals diagnosed with ASD according to DSM 5 standards. Additionally, our sample was part of a larger study on the phenotypic profiles of children with PDD, which discovered that around 30% of the sample had a profile more consistent with the DSM-5 diagnosis of Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder. As a result, readers should examine our conclusions in light of this context.",0
11,20," The YSR self-report data was analyzed to gather information on how adolescents are dealing with their internalizing comorbidities. Surprisingly, the study found that parents reported higher rates of anxiety in their children compared to the self-reported rates. However, adolescent self-reports did show a higher rate of subclinical depressive symptoms. It's important to note that DISC-P and YSR data cannot be directly compared due to their differences, and more research is needed to fully understand the comorbidities in this group over time.",0
11,21," The authors express their gratitude towards the children and parents who took part in the project. The Sophia Foundation for Scientific Research (SSWO; Grant 586, 2009) and the NutsOhra Foundation (Grant 0803-53) provided financial support for the research.",0

11,24," The parents of the children involved in the study signed consent forms before wave 1, and both the children and their parents signed the forms before wave 2. The study was also approved by the local Medical Ethics Committee (MEC-2008-388).",0
12,1," In two experiments, rats were exposed to the flavor of almond paired with either fructose or maltodextrin, and their preference for almond was tested. The rats were split into two groups, with half having prior exposure to almond and half having none. During the first experiment, hungry rats showed a greater preference for almond in the nonpreexposed group regardless of which sweetener was used, indicating latent inhibition. In the second experiment, rats that were not food-deprived showed no latent inhibition and had a greater preference for almond in the preexposed group. These results suggest that different types of learning control behavior depending on hunger levels, but do not support the idea that different types of reinforcers generate different types of learning.",0
12,2," The previous experience with an event, which is used as the conditioned stimulus in classical conditioning, often slows down the acquisition of the conditioned response. This is known as latent inhibition effect and is seen in most conditioning techniques, except for the flavor-preference conditioning procedure. In this method, rats are given a choice between plain water and water with a flavor they have previously consumed with a positive substance. The rats tend to choose the flavored water more, suggesting conditioning has occurred. Exposure to the conditioned stimulus before training does not always produce the same effect, and there are varying results in the literature.",0
12,3," The findings suggest that the preference for sucrose can be established through multiple mechanisms. Sucrose has both a sweet taste and nutritive consequences, making it capable of supporting preference conditioning. A non-nutritive substance like saccharin can still be effective in preference conditioning, while intragastric infusion of a nutrient can form a preference regardless of its taste properties. Sucrose supports both flavor-taste and flavor-nutrient learning.",0
12,4," The interpretation of the results from Garcia-Burgos et al. (2013) could be tested by using separate procedures to examine flavor-nutrient and flavor-taste learning. The former is expected to show latent inhibition, while the latter is not. Previous experiments have provided some information, but they used unorthodox procedures. For instance, Weingarten and Kulikovsky (1989) reported results from a study that investigated rats' response to sham-feeding, suggesting that preexposure to a flavor restricts the learning of an association between the flavor and the postingestive consequences of feeding. However, in a study by Galef and Durlach (1993), no latent inhibition was found, and the enhanced flavor preference induced by this training was not prevented by preexposure to the flavor. In the experiments reported here, the researchers attempted to isolate flavor-taste and flavor-nutrient learning by using substances other than sucrose as the unconditioned stimuli and the standard preference-conditioning procedure.",0
12,5," The effects of different USs may be more complex than described in the paragraph. Intragastric fructose can support preference learning to some extent, but not as strongly as sucrose. Flavor-nutrient learning can occur with fructose, as demonstrated by a taste reactivity test on rats. Comparing fructose with maltodextrin has been successful in addressing other issues in flavor-preference learning. Looking for latent inhibition in rats trained with either fructose or maltodextrin as the US can help determine if different mechanisms underlie the preferences established by these USs. Finding evidence of an effect with maltodextrin but not fructose would support the hypothesis that the mechanism engaged by fructose is not susceptible to latent inhibition.",0
12,6," The researchers divided the rats into four separate groups. Two of these groups were familiarized with the taste of almonds while the rest were not. The rats were then given two different mixtures containing almond along with either fructose or maltodextrin. During the final test, all the rats were given two bottles, one holding the almond solution and the other holding water. To ensure that the rats drank the fluids provided, they were deprived of water during training but had access to food. However, prior to the test, all access to food was removed to ensure that the hunger of the rats did not affect any preference towards a specific solution.",0
12,7," The University of Granada Ethics Committee approved all experimental procedures. The experiment began by removing water bottles 24 hours before and allowing the rats to adjust to a deprivation schedule for three days. Each day, rats were randomly assigned to either an almond or water group and given access to the corresponding liquid for 10 minutes, followed by 30 minutes of free water access twice a day. After the exposure phase, rats were divided into four groups based on their average almond or water consumption for the conditioning phase.",0
