12,8,"The absolute scores for the consumption of water and the almond solution, on which the ratios were based, are presented in the top panel of Fig. 2. The pattern is the same for both reinforcers, with both NPre groups drinking less water than almond, but both Pre groups drinking less almond than water. There was substantial within-group variability in the absolute consumption scores, and an ANOVA on those for the consumption of almond, with preexposure condition and reinforcer as the variables, showed only a marginally significant main effect of preexposure, F(1, 28) = 3.03, p = .09, 灰p 2 = .10; other Fs < 2. The water scores showed no significant differences (all Fs < 1).",1
12,9,"The subjects were 32 male na?ve Wistar rats (Janvier, France) with a mean body weight of 355 g at the start of the experiment. The housing, general maintenance, solutions, and apparatus were the same as we described for Experiment 1, with the exceptions mentioned below.",1
12,10,"As in Experiment 1, the subjects in the Pre groups received eight sessions of preexposure to almond, and the NPre subjects received unflavored water, prior to conditioning with either the almond + fructose compound or the almond + maltodextrin compound, and then the choice test. Food was available throughout, except for the 30-min duration of each conditioning and test session. In our previous experiments investigating preferences in nonhungry rats (Garcia-Burgos et al., 2013), we gave two conditioning每test cycles (i.e., after the first test, the rats received two further sessions of conditioning, followed by another test), and this procedure was followed here.",1
12,11,"As in Experiment 1, the rats drank readily during preexposure, and we found no differences among the groups. The mean consumptions (in grams) of almond over the course of this phase were 8.2 for group Pre/M and 8.3 for group Pre/F. The mean consumptions of water were 8.4 for group NPre/M and 8.2 for group NPre/F. As we assessed by an ANOVA with preexposure and reinforcer as the variables, no significant effects were present, largest F(1, 28) = 1.54, p = .225, 灰p 2 = .05.",1
12,12,"Mean preference ratios pooled over the two tests for each group appear in Fig. 1 (right; the groups are now labeled TTT, for being only thirsty in all stages of the study). Scores were somewhat higher for maltodextrin than for fructose, and, in striking contrast to the results of Experiment 1, the preexposed groups showed a higher, rather than a lower, preference for almond, irrespective of the reinforcer. This reversal of the latent inhibition effect was quite unexpected. An ANOVA conducted on the average preference ratios, with preexposure and reinforcer as the variables, yielded significant main effects of preexposure, F(1, 28) = 5.17, p = .031, 灰p 2 = .16, and of reinforcer, F(1, 28) = 5.48, p = .027, 灰p 2 = .16; the interaction was not significant (F < 1).",1
12,13,"Although the patterns of preference scores were the same for fructose and maltodextrin, inspection of the absolute consumption scores shows marked differences. The lower panel of Fig. 2 shows the group means for consumption of almond and water, pooled over both test trials. For maltodextrin, consumption levels of water and almond were approximately the same in subjects given no preexposure, but more almond than water was consumed by the preexposed animals. For fructose, on the other hand, the preexposed subjects were the ones to drink equal amounts, whereas the nonpreexposed subjects drank more water than almond. Rats conditioned with maltodextrin drank more almond than did those conditioned with fructose. An ANOVA on the scores for consumption of almond, with preexposure condition and reinforcer as the variables, showed a significant effect of the nature of the reinforcer, F(1, 28) = 6.48, p = .017, 灰p 2 = .08; the main effect of preexposure, F(1, 28) = 2.57, p = .120, and the interaction (F < 1) were not significant. Water consumption, by contrast, was sensitive to the effects of preexposure, with preexposed subjects drinking less than nonpreexposed subjects. An ANOVA showed a significant effect of preexposure, F(1, 28) = 6.03, p = .021, 灰p 2 = .18; the main effect of reinforcer, F(1, 28) = 1.54, p = .225, and the interaction (F < 1) were not significant.",1
12,14,"Latent inhibition is a powerful and well-documented effect, and any failure to observe retarded conditioning after extensive preexposure to the CS requires attention. The absence of latent inhibition in rats conditioned with sucrose as the US and tested when not hungry (Garcia-Burgos et al., 2013) prompted the hypothesis that a preference supported by flavor每taste learning is not susceptible to latent inhibition. In the present experiments, we attempted to test this hypothesis by making use of maltodextrin and fructose as the reinforcers and by testing preexposed and nonpreexposed subjects either in a state of hunger (Exp. 1) or when sated (Exp. 2). On the basis of the evidence presented in the Introduction, it was supposed that maltodextrin would engender flavor每nutrient learning, the effect of which would be evident in the preference shown by hungry animals, and that fructose would engender flavor每 taste learning, capable of producing a preference even in nonhungry animals.",1
12,15,"The results of the experiments did not support these suppositions. We found, for subjects not given preexposure to the CS, that both USs were capable of generating a preference when the rats were hungry during the test, and when the rats were not hungry, neither produced a clear preference. If the proposed distinction between flavor每taste and flavor每nutrient learning is to be maintained, we must suppose that, with the stimuli and procedures used in our experiments, both USs are capable of producing flavor每nutrient learning, and that the effect of flavor每taste learning is weak for both reinforcers. This would impose limits on the strategy of using these two reinforcers to distinguish between two kinds of flavorpreference learning, suggesting that, at least under the conditions used in the present experiments, they may be functionally equivalent (for related results in the case of blocking, see Gonz芍lez, Garcia-Burgos, & Hall, 2014).",1
12,16,"To an extent, therefore, these findings confirm those of Garcia-Burgos et al. (2013), from their experiments using sucrose as the US, in that latent inhibition was evident in flavorpreference conditioning when the subjects were hungry during the test, but not when they were sated. An obvious interpretation of this pattern of results, at least at first sight, is that hunger promotes the expression of a preference (whatever the US), allowing conditioning to be seen clearly, and thus, the effect of preexposure to be observed. It might be argued that the absence of latent inhibition in the study by Garcia-Burgos et al. was merely a consequence of a low sensitivity to appetitive conditioning in nonhungry animals. But this cannot explain the results of the present Experiment 2, in which nonhungry rats showed a significant reversal of the latent inhibition effect. Other factors must be at work.",1
12,17,"In summary, the use of maltodextrin and fructose as USs does not allow the clean separation of flavor每taste and flavor每 nutrient learning that we had hoped for, but the manipulation of motivational state has a marked effect on latent inhibition. With both USs, preexposure retards the development of a conditioned preference for animals tested in a state of hunger, consistent with the conclusion that both generate flavor每nutrient learning that is susceptible to latent inhibition. When the subjects are not hungry during the test, there is an apparent reversal of latent inhibition. The source of this effect is complex and debatable, but we have offered a possible explanation that is consistent with the original proposal that flavor每taste learning is not susceptible to latent inhibition.",1

When I was eight years old I went to an afterschool dance class. There I discovered a place that was congruent with my nature. Instead of being admonished to sit still, I was encouraged to move, to dance out my fanciful dreams and my darkest fears. The teacher, Edith Siegel, was my first model of a free spirited woman and a political activist. We danced war, poverty, peace, and freedom ＃ When those dance classes were over, I asked my parents to enroll me in a dancing school. They said, ＆No.＊ I remember crying all day and into the night. They still said, ＆No.＊ Not because they were mean spirited, but because they were poor. They wanted to see me get a job with security, minimally a pension. That day was a turning point when I realized that my parents could not meet my needs. In order to be myself I would have to forego parental approval. (ADTA, 1987, p. 5)",1

Plans had been made to hold the ADTA＊s third annual conference, in 1968, in Chicago.

Held on November 10, at New York City＊s Postgraduate Center for Mental Health under the auspices of its Director and Associate Director of Research, this was the first event ever organized around research on dance therapy. Among the speakers and presenters representing DMT were Sharon Chaiklin and Mary Whitehouse who presented their work on film.

13,18,"In the early seventies I raised the unpopular notion of approval for graduate programs. This was met with outrage and resistance. It took about five years to become accepted. In my next foray I urged that we adopt a single title for the graduate degree. I thought it should be an MS in Dance Therapy; Beth [Kalish] thought it should be in Movement Therapy. This time I lost the battle but won the war.

17,46,"According to language control models, several of the described processing stages could be a locus of language control. Yet, there seems to be a divide among these models with respect to the functional locus or loci that they propose. Some models assume that the functional locus of language control can be found at the concept level (La Heij, 2005; Poulisse & Bongaerts, 1994; see also Schwieter & Sunderman (2008) with highly proficient bilinguals). La Heij (2005), for example, assumed that language cues at the concept stage allow for additional activation of the target representation in the correct language. Consequently, target representations in the corresponding language should be selected.",1
17,47,"Other models assume that the functional locus of language control can be found at the lemma level (Declerck et al., 2015a; Grainger et al., 2010; Green, 1998; see also Schwieter & Sunderman (2008) with second language learners). In the modified ICM (Declerck et al., 2015a), bilingual language processing starts with the activation of language schemas, which are mental devices that are implemented to achieve task-specific goals, like speaking in a certain language. Once the lemmas have been activated by their respective concepts, each language schema activates their corresponding language node and an inhibitory competition process occurs between these language node(s). In turn, the language nodes inhibit lemmas of the other language. Finally, competition between the target lemma and the translationequivalent lemma results in selection. So, language control occurs between language nodes and between lemmas (both located at the lemma level) according to this model. Furthermore, this model also includes stronger connections from concepts to the respective L1 lemmas than from concepts to their respective L2 lemmas for second language learners (cf. Kroll & Stewart, 1994; see also Schwieter & Sunderman, 2008).",1
17,48,"Since the modified ICM (Declerck et al., 2015a) is based on the original ICM (Green, 1998), a similar progression is assumed in the latter. The main difference is that language control is presumed to occur between language schemas and between lemmas, according to this model, instead of between language nodes and lemmas in the modified ICM. Interestingly, the schemas proposed to control for language interference are similar to those used for more general cognitive control according to the ICM. Hence, the ICM assumes that language control occurs at the lemma level and outside of language processing",1
17,49,"In the BIA + (Dijkstra & van Heuven, 2002), a similar process is proposed to occur during comprehension-based language control as in the BIA, with the most important distinction being the differentiation between the word identification system, which entails linguistic influences, and a task/decision system, which entails nonlinguistic task schema influences. The latter being a processing stage outside of language processing.",1
17,50,"Thus, several loci of language control have been proposed, ranging from the concept level, lemma level, and a processing stage outside of language processing (i.e., cognitive control processes). Interestingly, several models have even proposed more than one locus of language control (Declerck et al., 2015a; Dijkstra & van Heuven, 2002; Green, 1998), both within and outside of language processing. In the next sections we will discuss whether there is empirical evidence for any of these potential control loci, and some that have not yet been considered (i.e., phonology and orthography).",1
17,51,"Since several models of language control proposed an important role for the concept level (Declerck et al., 2015a; La Heij, 2005; Poulisse & Bongaerts, 1994; Schwieter & Sunderman, 2008), either by differently weighed connections to the corresponding lemmas or as a functional locus of language control, one would assume that manipulations on this level would affect language switching. Declerck et al. (2015a) found that concepts and concept activation can have an impact on switch costs. In this study, German每English bilinguals could prepare through predictable information for several aspects of language switching (i.e., language, concept, or both). When concepts could be prepared, smaller L1 switch costs were observed than when concepts could not be prepared, whereas the effect of concept preparation on L2 switch costs was much smaller. This finding was explained by a stronger connection between concepts and L1 lemmas than between concepts and L2 lemmas (Kroll & Stewart, 1994). Hence, when a concept could be prepared, more activation was sent to the respective L1 lemma than to the L2 lemma, making it easier to select the former in a switch condition. These differently weighed connections have been implemented in several language control models (Declerck et al., 2015a; Grainger et al., 2010; Schwieter & Sunderman, 2008).",1
17,52,"Hence, while the study of Declerck et al. (2015a) indicates that language control could already initiate at the concept level, little to no further research has been conducted in this field. This demonstrates the pressing need for additional research into the role of the concept level during language control.",1
17,53,"Even though many models assume that language control occurs, at least partially, at the lemma level, very few studies have investigated this. Some evidence for the involvement of lemmas during language control comes from studies that investigated language switching with sentences instead of single words, since each lemma includes the syntactic information of the word, and sentence processing is assumed to occur at the lemma level (for a review on bilingual models of sentence processing, see Hartsuiker & Pickering, 2008). Tarlowski, Wodniecka, et al. (2013), for example, asked Polish每English bilinguals to describe a scene on a picture, either in a present progressive or a present perfective phrase. Their results indicated that language switch costs can be obtained when switching between sentences (for a similar result within sentences, see Bultena, Dijkstra, & van Hell, 2015). Furthermore, asymmetrical switch costs were obtained with progressive phrases and symmetrical switch costs with perfective phrases. From the latter finding it appears that different aspects of sentence processing, and thus lemma processing, can have an impact on language switching.",1
17,54,"Declerck and Philipp (2015a) also found evidence for the influence of sentence processing on language switching. Their results indicated no switch costs with the SBLS paradigm when German每English bilinguals produced words in sentences that were syntactically correct when translating it word-to-word to the other language (for other studies that found no switch costs with sentences, see also Dussias, 2003; Gullifer, Kroll, & Dussias, 2013; Ib芍?ez, Macizo, & Bajo, 2010; Zhang et al., 2014). On the other hand, substantial switch costs were still observed in scrambled sentences or sentences that were not syntactically correct when translating it word-to-word. These results further support the influence of syntactic sentence information on language switching.",1
17,55,"The earliest studies that manipulated characteristics of phonology in language switching tasks were studies that investigated cognate status.2 Although studies exploring the role of cognates on switch costs found an effect, a discrepancy in the switch cost pattern has been observed between studies that implemented cognates or noncognates in individual blocks (e.g., Declerck et al., 2012) compared against studies that used cognates and non-cognates in the same block (e.g., Christoffels et al., 2007; Filippi et al., 2014; Thomas & Allport, 2000). In the former, switch costs are smaller with cognates, whereas in the latter switch costs are larger for cognates relative to noncognates.",1
17,56,"Taken together, while the present findings are encouraging, due to the small amount of studies it is hard to come to any final conclusions. More research in this theoretically important field of language control should help our understanding of the role of lemmas.",1
17,57,"Interestingly, Broersma (2011) found that switch trial interference was smaller after cognates than after non-cognates. This would explain the smaller switch costs with cognates than noncognates when they are both implemented in separate blocks (i.e., Declerck et al., 2012) as a persisting effect on the phonological level (e.g., persisting activation/inhibition). The larger switch costs when cognates and noncognates are presented in the same blocks could then be explained with withintrial control processes.",1
17,58,"Whereas the previous studies mainly manipulated phonological features within trials, Declerck and Philipp (2015b) investigated the effect of phonological overlap across trials. More specifically, words with the same first two phonemes as the word in the previous trial were compared against words that did not phonologically overlap with the word on the previous trial. The results showed that phonological overlap changed the switch cost asymmetry between L1 and L2. Hence, this study indicates that due to a phonological manipulation, persisting control effects were affected in language switching, providing additional support to the idea that phonological processing has an effect on language control.",1
17,59,"Yet, not all language switching studies find a clear effect by manipulating phonological characteristics. Declerck et al. (2013) found no switch cost difference between words that consisted solely of phonemes that occur in both languages (e.g., Bein, meaning Bleg^ in German) and words that contained language-specific phonemes (e.g., Katze, meaning Bcat^ in German). This study seems to indicate that differences in phonological aspects of the stimulus words (i.e., language-specific vs. language-unspecific phonemes) do not always have an effect on language control in language switching. It should be noted, however, that there was a numerical difference due to language-specific phonemes in L2 trials: The data showed larger L2 switch costs for words with language-specific phonemes (switch costs: 80 ms), relative to words without language-specific phonemes (switch costs: 48 ms). Hence, even in this study it appears that there is some indication for a role of phonology during language control",1
17,60,"There are several interpretations of these phonological studies: Some assume an indirect effect of the phonological level on language control at the lemma level (Declerck & Philipp, 2015b; Goldrick et al., 2014), whereas others assume that language control, next to the lemma level, also occurs at the phonology level (Olson, 2013). Goldrick et al. (2014) proposed that the difference in lemma activation, caused by language control in favor of the target language, spills over into the respective phonemes and thus allows for differences in phonology. Declerck and Philipp (2015), on the other hand, argued that there could be phonological feedback loops from the phonological representations back to the lemmas (see also, e.g., Bernolet, Hartsuiker, & Pickering, 2012; Costa, Roelstrate, & Hartsuiker, 2006; Dell, 1988). This would entail that the activation of lemmas would be influenced by phonology. In turn, language control at the lemma level would be influenced by phonology.",1
17,61,"Despite the discussion as to whether the phonological level plays a direct or indirect role in language control, the consensus seems to be that the phonology level plays an important role during language control. Further research into this area of language switching should help us narrow down the exact role.",1

The study revealed that the ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales have a one-dimensional structure in both samples, along with good internal consistency, test-retest reliability in the community sample, and excellent convergent and divergent validity. The ECBI Intensity Scale proved to be an excellent discriminant measure for differential diagnosis between various symptomatic conditions including ADHD, ODD, CD, and no diagnosis. The findings confirmed that the ECBI is a reliable measure of disruptive behavior in the Dutch population, though suggestions were made regarding how best to use the scale for research and screening purposes, along with additional research into the validity of the test for cross-cultural use.",0
16,3," 

Intervening early is crucial to lessen the chances of severe disruptive conduct in adolescence and adulthood, as cited by Aos et al. (2004) and Heckman (2006). The most effective means of therapy for young kids and their parents are psychosocial treatments, according to Comer et al. (2013) and Eyberg et al. (2008). However, a reliable early screening process for behavioral issues in children is prerequisite to give such therapy. The most commonly used and efficient way of screening behavioral problems in young children is through parent rating scales (Funderburk et al. 2003).",0
16,4," The ECBI, a parent rating scale designed to measure disruptive behavior in children aged 2 to 16, is widely used for early screening in clinical and research settings. Its strengths include sensitivity in measuring the effect of treatment on such behaviors, its brevity and ease of completion, and its utilization of two scales to assess disruptive child behavior. The ECBI is particularly suitable for screening in less educated families and less demanding than more comprehensive instruments.",0
16,5," The ECBI is utilized in various locations around the world such as the United States (US), Europe, Japan, South Korea, and China, with translations available in multiple languages. The ECBI's reliability and validity have been supported by over 20 studies conducted across different cultures and countries. High internal consistency has been demonstrated in different sociodemographic subgroups through the two scales with alphas greater than .90. The ECBI has good retest reliability with evidence suggesting a correlation coefficient of .75 over a 10 month period. Normative data from community samples indicate that the mean scores on the ECBI are lower in Northern European countries including Sweden and Norway compared to the US as shown through studies conducted by Colvin et al. in 1999 and further explored by Axberg et al. in 2008 and Reedtz et al. in 2008.",0
16,6,"

There are indications that the ECBI Intensity Scale is strongly associated with other widely used questionnaires that evaluate child behavior issues, such as CBCL (Achenbach and Rescorla 2000) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman 1997), demonstrating satisfactory construct validity. In a non-clinical sample of Swedish children aged between 3 and 10 years, the correlation between the ECBI Intensity Scale and the total difficulties scale of the SDQ was found to be 0.68 (Axberg et al. 2008). In a clinically referred sample of US children between the ages of 4 and 16 years, the correlation between the ECBI Intensity Scale and the CBCL Externalizing Behavior scale was 0.75 (Boggs et al. 1990). As expected, the correlations with scales that measure externalizing behavior issues were higher than the correlations with scales that measure internalizing behavior problems (Axberg et al. 2008; Butler 2011). In terms of the discriminative validity of the ECBI, a clinically referred US sample studied by Weis and others (2005) found that the Intensity Scale was able to differentiate between groups of children with no significant externalizing problems, kids with inattentive and oppositional behavior symptoms, and children with more severe behavioral issues.",0
16,7,"

Although the ECBI has a wide usage and strong validity evidence across countries, there is no evidence of its psychometric properties in the Netherlands and other European countries. Thus, it is crucial to have the knowledge of its psychometric properties for screening and treatment evaluations, especially in a Dutch community and clinical population. The present study aims to assess the psychometric qualities of the ECBI scales, including internal consistency, test-retest reliability, reproducibility, convergent, divergent, and discriminative validity, in both community and clinical samples. As the Intensity and Problem Scales of the ECBI have shown good psychometric properties in international studies, we expected similar results in this study.",0
16,8," After initial findings supported the use of the ECBI as a three-factor measure for child behavioral problems, subsequent research by Gross et al. in 2007 provided backing for its validity as a one-dimensional measure. However, Butler's 2011 study in a community sample of low-income families from diverse cultural backgrounds and ethnicities failed to reproduce the three-factor structure and suggested that these factors were unsuitable for screening or treatment outcome research.",0
16,9," 
Previous studies have utilized factor analysis to determine the factor structure of the ECBI. However, this approach is heavily reliant on the sample used, which can result in varying outcomes. While the three-factor structure of the ECBI has not been utilized in treatment outcome research, there remains a preference for the use of the ECBI as a single-dimensional measure of child disruptive behavior. Nonetheless, further exploration with a larger sample is necessary to better understand the optimal use of the ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales. Modern scale validation methods, such as Rasch analysis or Item response theory (IRT) analysis, that produce less sample-dependent outcomes could be used in this research.",0
16,10," The study's second objective was to utilize modern test analysis techniques to verify the one-dimensional structure of the ECBI scales, thereby supplying additional insight into the ECBI's dimensional structure.",0

A total of 326 parents, mostly mothers (86.8%), with children aged 2 to 8 years (M=5.54, SD=1.40) completed the ECBI. Of the children, 165 were boys and 161 were girls. Ethnic backgrounds were classified using Statistics Netherlands' (2013) criteria, resulting in three categories - 90.8% of the children were classified as Dutch, 4.9% as other western, and 4.3% as non-western. Parental education was divided into three categories: low (no or primary education), middle (secondary education), and high (higher academic education), based on Statistics Netherlands' (2014) classification.",0
16,21," The ECBI scales showed high internal consistency in both the community sample (COS; IS & PS; 帢=.93) and the clinical sample (CLS; IS; 帢=.93, PS; 帢=.91). Father reports in the clinical sample were almost equal (IS; 帢=.93, PS; 帢=.92), and corrected item-total correlations were similar in both samples. The coefficients ranged from 0.09 to 0.73 for the ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales, with the median scores ranging from 0.46 to 0.55. Overall, the item-total correlation was satisfactory.",0

Moreover, in the clinical sample, child ethnicity had a significant effect on the mother ECBI Intensity Scale (F=(2165) 10.88, p<.01), as revealed by one-way ANOVA.",0
16,24," There were weaker correlations between measures completed by fathers compared to mothers across all scales, with mothers reporting more similar behavior problems on the ECBI and SDQ. As expected, the externalizing behavior SDQ scales had higher correlations than the Emotional Symptoms Scale and Peer Problems Scale. Additionally, the ECBI scales (especially the IS) had negative correlations with the SDQ Prosocial Behavior Scale.",0
16,25," The aim of this study was to analyze the psychometric attributes of the ECBI in Dutch kids. The study looked at dimensionality, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent, divergent, and discriminative validity. The results revealed that the ECBI possesses good psychometric characteristics in the Netherlands. These results align with our hypotheses and earlier international studies.",0
16,26," The ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales showed good convergent and divergent validity with the SDQ in a clinical sample, which is consistent with previous studies. The strong correlations between the two scales and the similarity of patterns across different informants suggest the possibility of combining them into a single scale. However, Eyberg (1992) emphasized the importance of distinguishing between the two scales as they capture related but distinct dimensions of disruptive behavior in children. Parental perceptions may be the underlying construct of the separate scales, and they could be particularly useful in understanding parental tolerance.",0
16,27," Parents who score low on Intensity but high on the Problem Scale may be experiencing high levels of parenting stress and intolerance towards their child's behavior. Conversely, those with a high Intensity score but a low Problem score may have a high tolerance for their child's behavior or may be hesitant to acknowledge any behavioral problems. While the ECBI scales are useful for understanding parental perceptions, future research should focus on the effectiveness of utilizing both scales in treatment and screening. It is recommended to use additional measures like observational methods and the Parenting Stress Index to assess child behavior problems and parental distress.",0
16,28," The findings imply that weighing items during screening may be useful. For instance, if parents report frequent occurrences of a behavior on an item with significant weight, such as temper tantrums (item 13), the child is likely to score high on the ECBI Intensity Scale. Simply inquiring about the frequency of temper tantrums could help identify young children at risk for disruptive behavior issues and refer them for preventive treatment. This approach is innovative in using the ECBI scales and warrants more research on the item weighting system.",0
16,29," The Dutch ECBI version may benefit from minor changes as per Axberg et al.'s (2008) suggestions. To reduce missing items, a checkbox for sibling items (25 & 27) would be useful where raters can signify if it applies to their child. Furthermore, low item statistics on item 36 (bedwetting) imply that an explanation of this item and a checkbox for applicability may be necessary. However, these changes could impact the total ECBI scores and require further consideration.",0
16,30," The mean scores of the ECBI Intensity and Problem Scale for the overall community sample were considerably lower compared to the US norms discovered by Colvin and colleagues (1999) regarding normative data.

16,31," The study has several limitations, including underrepresentation of ethnic minority groups in the community sample, an unknown response rate, and a high attrition rate. Therefore, there is a lack of information on the generalizability of the results. Further research should focus on psychometric properties, mean scores, response rates, and attrition prevention in multi-ethnic community samples. Additionally, the non-normal distributions of scores in the ECBI scales in the community sample were attributed to more frequent selection of low answer categories. Due to limited variation and small sample sizes, data from both samples were combined in the IRT analysis.",0
16,32," The clinical diagnoses in the study were limited by the lack of a standardized procedure to assess significant symptoms of ADHD, ODD and CD in Dutch children. Therefore, the term classifications was used instead of diagnoses. However, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results regarding the classifications, as is common in Dutch clinical practice.",0
16,33," The study's findings support the reliability of the ECBI as a measure of disruptive behavior in Dutch children. The ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales showed consistency and correlated with the established SDQ questionnaire. The Intensity Scale also distinguished between diagnostic groups in externalizing behavior. The ECBI's one-dimensional structure makes it practical for screening and intervention research, especially with the original scales. Incorporating weighted items could further enhance the efficacy of the ECBI, but this concept requires additional exploration.",0

17,1," Language control, which restricts bilingual language processing to the target language, has been a key area of investigation in language switching. In this review, we delve into the mechanisms and loci of language control in language switching. We detail a range of empirical markers of language switching and their association with inhibition, an important mechanism of language control. Although some markers suggest inhibition during language switching, not all do. We then explore the potential loci of language control and the role of different processing stages. Studies indicate the involvement of several processing stages, suggesting a complex control mechanism or multiple loci of language control. Based on these findings, various established and new theoretical pathways are explored.",0
17,2," Non-target language words can be accidentally activated and selected while processing language for bilinguals, leading to the need for language control to restrict production and decrease interference during comprehension. Language control is effective in preventing the selection of non-target language words during production, as shown in studies by Gollan et al. (2011) and Poulisse & Bongaerts (1994). A common task used to explore language control mechanisms is language switching. (Rephrased for clarity and coherence)",0
17,3," The purpose of this review was to examine the mechanisms of language control in language switching and explore the significance of various processing stages (including concept level, lemma level, phonology, orthography, and outside language processing) in regulating language switching. Behavioral outcomes were the primary focus for both of these issues, and their correlation with language control models was evaluated. (For nonbehavioral language switching analyses, see Abutalebi & Green, 2007, 2008; Luk, Green, Abutalebi, & Grady, 2012).",0
17,4," The cue language switching paradigm is widely used in language switching literature. This paradigm presents visual stimuli such as digits or pictures to indicate the concepts that must be named. Due to the implementation of multiple languages in language switching, visual language cues are utilized to signify the language in which the concepts need to be produced. As this procedure primarily applies to production studies, comprehension studies use written words instead. These inherently contain information about the necessary target language, negating the requirement for an additional, explicit visual cue.",0
17,5," Meuter and Allport's (1999) influential study provides an instance of cued language switching where bilingual participants (speaking English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, or Spanish) were given digits to identify the requested concept and colored rectangles (blue and yellow) to indicate the needed language. They were instructed to identify the digits based on the relevant language cue.",0
17,6," Bilinguals had to either alternate between two languages or repeat the same language in consecutive trials. Studies by various researchers, including Meuter and Allport (1999), have consistently shown that there is a higher rate of errors and slower response times during language switching trials compared to repetition trials. This phenomenon is referred to as ""switch costs.""",0
17,12," In order to perform sequence-based language switching (SBLS), bilinguals must memorize a sequence for language and concept. While no visual cues are needed for alternating language switching, SBLS presents visual language cues and stimuli. Bilinguals must follow an alternating language sequence without visual cues, but concepts must follow a specific sequential order. In response, bilinguals hear an auditory response-signal with no visual indication of when to respond. SBLS shows switch and mixing costs despite the predictability of upcoming responses.",0
17,13," It can be inferred from various paradigms that switching languages typically incurs a performance cost, regardless of whether language cues or stimuli are used. This is evidenced by switch costs and/or mixing costs, which are observed in all types of experimental language switching, except for voluntary language switching under specific conditions. Along with this consistency, each paradigm has its own strengths and weaknesses.",0
17,14," Research on language switching in language production tasks has provided a significant amount of information for the cued language switching paradigm. Although comprehension tasks usually do not implement cues, researchers have gained considerable knowledge about the effects and processes involved in cued language switching.",0
17,15," The cued language switching paradigm offers another benefit in the form of altered time-based intervals, including the cue-to-stimulus interval that reflects active language preparation and the response-to-cue interval that reflects passive decay (Kiesel et al., 2010). These intervals cannot be as easily manipulated in other language switching paradigms.",0
17,16," The paradigm of alternating language switching permits preplanning of language, since the bilingual person knows when they will switch to another language, which is akin to preplanning during natural language production. Therefore, they can prepare for the next language by following the predictable sequence.",0
17,17," Even more similar to switching between languages in everyday conversation is the voluntary language switching paradigm. This approach doesn't depend on outside language prompts but on internal ones, which means that bilingual speakers can plan in advance which language to use. Furthermore, voluntary language switching allows for the collection of data on when and how frequently bilingual speakers switch between languages, providing additional perspectives into the intricacies of language control during switching.",0
17,18," The SBLS paradigm enables sequential predictability of language control, which applies to language predictability in alternating and voluntary language switching paradigms, but in SBLS, it covers the entire word. One of the benefits of this paradigm is the broad scope of word categories that can be analyzed due to the memory-based concept sequence that allows for a wide range of words. However, other paradigms can also investigate different word categories if they utilize written words.",0
17,19," There is a wide range of language switching paradigms available, each with its own pros and cons, that can be utilized to investigate language control in language switching. However, all of these paradigms share the same objective of enabling researchers to examine the mechanics of language control and identify the key factors involved in language switching.",0
17,20," The inhibitory control model (ICM) by Green (1998) is an influential theory regarding language control. According to this model, switch costs stem from persisting inhibition. When a trial (n1) requires the production of a certain language, the non-target language is inhibited. In case the previously inhibited language is required for the next trial (n), the inhibition persists and needs to be overcome. However, if the same language is produced on trial n-1 and trial n, there is no need to overcome inhibition as in repetition trials. As per Green, the inhibitory process is reactive and more activation leads to more inhibition. Hence, it is harder to switch between languages due to the presence of persisting inhibition in switch trials.",0
17,21," Whereas the ICM has a production-based focus, the BIA model and its variants concentrate on comprehension-based language control. Switch costs are explained by the bottom-up activation of word representations to language nodes, which are mental language representations, and top-down inhibition of the irrelevant and competing language node. Switch trials activate a different language node, leading to interference with processing, while repetition trials use the same language node, allowing processing to occur without language interference. Therefore, switch costs are expected.",0
17,22," There are alternative language control models that do not depend on inhibition, which include studies by Costa, Miozzo, and Caramazza (1999), Finkbeiner et al. (2006), La Heij (2005), and Roelofs (1998). La Heij contends that a language cue heightens activation in the target language representation, and therefore inhibition is not necessary.",0
17,23," In contrast to the former models, which suggest that there is no inhibition involved in language switching, various studies have proposed inhibition as a key explanation for different language switching measures. These include asymmetrical switch costs, n-2 language repetition costs, and reversed language proficiency in mixed language blocks. The next sections will further explore these markers and their connection to inhibition.",0
