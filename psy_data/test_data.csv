14,2,"Trauma and stressor-related disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related comorbid disorders such as anxiety, depression, and dissociative disorders, are difficult to treat. Mindfulness-based clinical interventions have proven efficacy for mental health treatment in faceto-face individual and group modalities, although the feasibility and efficacy of delivering these interventions via the internet has not been evaluated. The present research developed mindfulness and metta-based trauma therapy (MMTT) as an internet resource to support the practice of mindfulness and metta (lovingkindness) meditations for self-regulation and healing from trauma and stressor-related disorders. In the present Bproof-of-concept^ study, research participants (n=177) recruited online practiced mindfulness and metta meditations and related therapeutic exercises available via the website and rated their perceived credibility as interventions for improving self-regulation and well-being and reducing PTSD symptoms, anxiety, depressive, and dissociative experiences, as well as their experienced ease, helpfulness, and informational value. Results suggest that, independent of level of self-reported current and past psychiatric history and PTSD symptoms, participants considered the MMTT website as a credible and helpful therapeutic intervention for improving self-regulation and wellbeing and reducing PTSD, anxiety, depression, and dissociation. ",1
14,3,"Clinicians and researchers have described a number of ways by which mindfulness-based therapies may exert therapeutic benefits for people with PTSD (Lang et al. 2012; Thompson et al. 2011). These include (1) improving attention and concentration; (2) improving participants¡¯ abilities to focus on the present and away from traumatic memories and other sources of rumination and anxiety; (3) altering of cognitive style (e.g., becoming less judgmental and more compassionate toward oneself and others); (4) lowering psychophysiological arousal; and (5) lowering of anhedonia and emotional numbing. A similar set of potential therapeutic benefits of mindfulness-based therapies for persons with traumarelated dissociative disorders was articulated by Zerubavel and Messman-Moore (2015). However, despite a sound treatment rationale, relatively few studies have examined the efficacy of mindfulness-based treatments for PTSD to date. Moreover, most published studies are limited by small sample sizes, inclusion of traumatized persons both with and without PTSD, and only pre-post (non-randomized) or wait-list control (rather than active control) designs. Acknowledging these limitations, research accumulated to date generally provides support for mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR, Kabat-Zinn 1990) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT, Segal et al. 2002) as interventions for persons with PTSD or PTSD-related symptoms either in combat veterans (Kearney et al. 2012; King et al. 2013; Niles et al. 2012) or women with histories of childhood abuse (Goldsmith et al. 2014; Kimbrough et al. 2010) or intimate partner violence (Bermudez et al. 2013; Dutton et al. 2013).",1
15,1,"In addition to examining mindfulness- and metta-based therapies for PTSD, researchers are examining the efficacy of non-traditional modalities for provision of treatment including internet-based treatment. An advantage of internet therapy is that it requires few clinical resources, with some evaluated programs being entirely automated and others entailing at most only a small number of face-to-face, telephone, or email communications per participant. Moreover, the ability for clinician-to-participant dyadic communication to be completed, if at all, solely through indirect methods can eliminate certain barriers that may otherwise prevent or discourage persons from receiving treatment where indicated, for example, due to social stigma associated with receiving mental health care, time and place accessibility, the financial cost of treatment, and the paucity of appropriately trained mental health professionals to deliver evidence-based treatment (see Boasso et al. 2014, for review). To date, psychological treatments for trauma and stressor-related disorders delivered via the internet generally involve exercises derived from cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), including narrative exposure therapy (structured writing about one¡¯s traumatic experiences) and certain forms of relaxation training.",1
15,2,"Previous studies have found internet service delivery of CBT for PTSD to be both highly acceptable and effective. In fact, research shows that PTSD outcomes for online treatment are often of a comparable magnitude to those found for the same kinds of interventions when delivered face to face, as has been generally found for internet therapy of other affective disorders (Andersson and Cuijpers 2009; Cowpertwait and Clarke 2013; Cuijpers et al. 2011; Spek et al. 2007). Indeed, the first study of internet treatment of PTSD was completed more than a decade ago and demonstrated, among 20 college students previously exposed to interpersonal violence, that providing CBT interventions for emotion regulation in addition to exposure-based narrative writing about traumatic events conducted via email resulted in clinically significant reductions in posttreatment PTSD symptoms (Lange et al. 2000). Since that time, research has suggested that individuals are indeed interested to receive internet-based treatments of PTSD (e.g., Spence et. al., 2011), and a number of additional studies have provided general support for internet CBT interventions for PTSD, although most studies have only compared outcomes via pre-post or non-active control designs (e.g., with supportive counseling; see Boasso et al. 2014, for review). However, we are aware of no internet-based mindfulness or metta interventions for PTSD and related comorbid disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, or dissociative disorders.",1
15,3,"In an effort to increase the availability of mindfulness- and metta-based interventions to persons with trauma and stressorrelated disorders, we therefore developed a self-help internet resource we titled mindfulness and metta-based trauma therapy (MMTT). MMTT is intentioned primarily as a set of selfregulatory practices aimed toward augmenting outcomes associated with existing evidence-based treatments. The present report describes our initial development and Bproof-ofconcept^ evaluation of the MMTT internet resource in the form of assessing participants¡¯ immediate experiences in response to completing the therapeutic exercises contained therein, that is, upon their first visit to the website. Participants were recruited via the internet and varied with respect to the presence or absence of diagnosed history of psychological disorders and self-reported PTSD. A more detailed description of the MMTT website content is given within the methods section. Our research aims were to evaluate the perceived credibility of the website content and interventions, broadly for improving self-regulation and well-being, as well as more specifically for treating PTSD and related comorbid symptoms of anxiety, depression, and dissociation",1
15,6,"The 20-item PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL5; Weathers et al. 2013) was administered. The PCL-5 is a measure of self-reported DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, with responses given on a frequency scale between BNot at all^ (scored 0) and BExtremely^(scored 4). The DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis includes 20 symptoms, hence the 20 PCL-5 items (i.e., the PCL-5 has a symptom to test-item ratio of 1:1). Total scores on the PCL-5 were calculated as the sum of scores for all 20 items, with a score of 38 recommended as a cut-off for probable PTSD (Hoge et al. 2014; Weathers et al. 2013). The internal consistency reliability observed in the present study was excellent (¦Á=0.97).",1
15,7,"In total, data were collected from 640 exercises. On average, participants completed 3.89 exercises (SD=1.09, range 1 [n=9] to 10 [n=1]); most participants completed either three (n=91, 51 %) or four (n=46, 26 %) exercises. PCL-5 scores ranged from 0 to 76 (M=21.37, SD=19.22), with 86 participants (49 %) scoring in the non-PTSD range (PCL-5¡Ü14), 53 (30 %) scoring in a mild-to-moderate PTSD symptom range (i.e., PCL-5 score between 15 and 37), and 37 participants (21 %) scoring at or above the cut-off score of 38 recommended for studies of the population prevalence of PTSD (Hoge et al. 2014; Weathers et al. 2013).",1

One-way ANOVAs indicated no significant differences between groups for ratings for any exercise type, although there were non-significant trends (p",1
15,9,"In general, the results of this pilot study suggest that participants considered the MMTT website as a highly credible and satisfactory self-help resource for meditation practice as well as for the learning and application of mindfulness and metta-related therapeutic principles to daily life. Participants tended to rate the website exercises as highly relevant, calming, enjoyable, and informative. With few exceptions, similar ratings were found irrespective of participants¡¯ selfreported PTSD symptom severity, suggesting that the website exercises were considered potentially helpful not only in the context of treatment for trauma and stressor-related disorders but also more broadly in support of persons seeking to improve their self-regulation and well-being within the general population.",1
16,9,"Two samples were included in the present study, a community sample (n=326) and a clinically referred sample (n=197). Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.",1
16,10,"Attrition analyses on the non-responders from the assessment of test-retest reliability indicated that parents of children with a non-western background were less likely to respond at the 6-month follow-up (¦Ö2 (1)=9.19, p",1
16,11,"In total, 326 parents (86.8 % mothers) of 2 to 8-year old (M=5.54, SD=1.40) children completed the ECBI. The sample included 165 boys and 161 girls. The classification criteria of Statistics Netherlands (2013) were used to classify each child¡¯s ethnic background resulting in three categories. Most of the children (90.8 %) were classified as Dutch, 4.9 % were classified as other western (for example Spanish or French), and 4.3 % was classified as non-western. Parental education was categorized as low (no education or primary education), middle (secondary education) or high (higher academic education) (Statistics Netherlands 2014).",1
16,12,"The overall sample consisted of 277 parents and 197 children (122 boys and 75 girls) aged between 2.5 and 8.5 years (M=5.53, SD=1.36). The dates of birth of four children were unknown. For these children we were therefore not able to calculate their exact age. For all children (N=197) the mother was involved in the study. Additionally, for 79 children (40.1 %) both parents completed the questionnaires, because the father was also involved in treatment. The sample consisted of participants from a range of ethnic backgrounds, 54.7 % of the children were classified as Dutch, 1.8 % was classified as other western and 43.5 % was classified as nonwestern (mainly Moroccan and Turkish families).",1
16,13,"The Intensity Scale (IS) and the Problem Scale (PS) of the ECBI were included in this study The Intensity Scale measures the frequency of child behavior problems using a 7-point Likert scale (1 = never to 7 = always) and the overall score reflects the severity of disruptive behavior. The Problem Scale measures parental tolerance for their child¡¯s misbehavior, which is measured by asking parents whether or not they view each of the described behaviors as problematic, using a dichotomous scale (1 = yes,0= no). The Dutch ECBI was translated and back-translated which resulted in a final version being approved by Psychological Assessment Resources (PAR). In the clinical sample, participant level data from the two treatment evaluation studies were pooled and two slightly different versions of the Dutch ECBI translations were used (i.e., minor differences in the wording of 12 of the 36 items). For example, item 11 (Argues/Discuses with parents about rules). Considering that differences were minor and preliminary analyses revealed no impact, we can assume that there were no effects of combining these two versions for the current study",1
16,14,"For most children in the clinically referred sample (n=137) a diagnostic assessment was conducted as part of the baseline assessment for the treatment evaluation study. For some families no diagnostic information was collected due to differences in clinical practice or practical issues, for example some families were not reached for the diagnostic interview before the start of treatment. Children were assessed for the presence of attention or hyperactivity problems, oppositional defiant behavior and conduct problem behavior based on the diagnostic criteria of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association 1994). Trained clinicians and psychiatrists administered these interviews and observations",1
16,19,"The internal consistency (Cronbach¡¯s alpha¡¯s) of the ECBI scales was high in both the community sample (COS; IS & PS; ¦Á=.93) and the clinical sample (CLS; IS; ¦Á=.93, PS; ¦Á=.91). Also, coefficients of the father reports in the clinical sample were almost equal (IS; ¦Á=.93, PS; ¦Á=.92). The corrected item-total correlations indicated similar results in both samples, with coefficients for the ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales ranging from 0.09 (item 36, Wets the bed) to 0.73 (item 9, Refuses to obey until threatened with punishment). The median of these scores ranged from 0.46 (CLS-PS) to 0.55 (CLS-IS), indicating an overall satisfactory item-total correlation.",1
16,20,"In general, factor loadings of the ECBI Intensity and Problem Scale items on the first dominant factor were satisfactory and ranged from 0.09 (item 36, Wets the bed) to 0.76 (item 10, Acts defiant when told to do something). The median factor loading scores ranged from 0.50 (CLS-PS) to 0.59 (CLS-IS). In both samples ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales factor loadings for item 36 (Wets the bed) were low (",1
16,21,"Table 2 shows the mean scores for the ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales for both samples, organized by children¡¯s age, sex and ethnicity, and informant¡¯s gender and educational level. Subgroup analyses revealed significant sex differences in the ECBI Intensity Scale in the community sample; boys had higher scores than girls (t (324)=2.32, p=.02) and in the ECBI Problem Scale in the Clinical Sample (t (175)=2.50, p=.01). The effect sizes for these differences were small (COS; d=.26, CLS; d=.38). Additionally, in the clinical sample one-way ANOVAs revealed a significant effect for child ethnicity on the mother ECBI Intensity Scale (F=(2165) 10.88, p",1
16,22,"For all scales, correlations were lower between measures completed by fathers than those completed by mothers. Mothers were more likely to report similar behavior problems on the ECBI and SDQ than fathers. As expected, Table 4 shows higher correlations for the externalizing behavior SDQ scales compared to the SDQ Emotional Symptoms Scale (rS=.12 to .37) and the SDQ Peer Problems Scale (rS=.03 to .14). Also, the ECBI scales (and in particular the IS) were negatively correlated with the SDQ Prosocial Behavior Scale (rS=?.10 to ?.44).",1
16,23,"The purpose of the current study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the ECBI in Dutch children. The dimensionality, internal consistency, test-retest reliability (reproducibility), convergent, divergent and discriminative validity were examined and our results provide evidence for good psychometric qualities of the ECBI in the Netherlands. This is in line with our hypotheses and the previous findings from other international studies.",1
16,24,"Good convergent and divergent validity of the ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales were found with the SDQ in the clinical sample. This is similar with results found by Axberg et al. (2008) in a Swedish community sample. Also, in other studies which examined the correlations of the ECBI Intensity Scale and Problem Scale with other scales for child behavior problems (e.g. Boggs et al. 1990; Funderburk et al. 2003). The strong correlations between the Intensity and Problems Scales (ranging from 0.62 to 0.75) found in the present study, the similar pattern of correlations found for the construct validity, and the similarity of the patterns over different informants (mothers and fathers), raise questions about the usefulness of keeping both ECBI scales separate. Given the parsimony criteria, it can be suggested to combine both scales into a single scale. In contrast with this suggestion, Eyberg (1992) stressed the importance of both ECBI scales which measure related but also include distinct dimensions of disruptive behavior in children. Eyberg (1992) suggested that parental perceptions are the underlying construct of the development of the separate scales. The ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales may be especially useful in regard to parental tolerance (McMahon and Frick 2007).",1
16,31,"The results of the current study provide evidence that the ECBI is a psychometrically sound measure for indicating disruptive behavior problems in children in the Netherlands. Data suggests that the ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales are internally consistent and appropriately correlated with another well-established questionnaire (the SDQ). The ECBI Intensity Scale is also able to differentiate between diagnostic groups within the externalizing behavior spectrum. Based on the evidence found for the one-dimensional structure of the ECBI, the original defined ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales are useful for screening and intervention research purposes in a Dutch population. The use of weighted items could also improve the use of the ECBI for screening purposes and clinical research, but further investigation on this new area is recommended.",1
16,32,The current study was conducted with the informed consent of all participants.

16,34,"Language switching has been one of the main tasks to investigate language control, a process that restricts bilingual language processing to the target language. In the current review, we discuss the How (i.e., mechanisms) and Where (i.e., locus of these mechanisms) of language control in language switching. As regards the mechanisms of language control, we describe several empirical markers of language switching and their relation to inhibition, as a potentially important mechanism of language control. From this overview it becomes apparent that some, but not all, markers indicate the occurrence of inhibition during language switching and, thus, language control. In a second part, we turn to the potential locus of language control and the role of different processing stages (concept level, lemma level, phonology, orthography, and outside language processing). Previous studies provide evidence for the employment of several of these processing stages during language control so that either a complex control mechanism involving different processing stages and/or multiple loci of language control have to be assumed. Based on the discussed results, several established and new theoretical avenues are considered.",1
16,35,"When bilinguals process language, words from the non-target language can be activated, and sometimes even selected by mistake (e.g., Costa, Caramazza, & Sebasti¨¢n-Gall¨¦s, 2000; Gollan, Sandoval, & Salmon, 2011; Hermans, Bongaerts, De Bot, & Schreuder, 1998). Therefore, it is crucial to restrict bilingual language production to the target language and to reduce between-language interference during bilingual language comprehension. This restriction process, called language control, appears to be very effective because very few non-target language words get selected during bilingual language production (e.g., Gollan et al., 2011; Poulisse & Bongaerts, 1994). One commonly used task to investigate the underlying mechanism of language control is language switching",1
17,11,"From these different paradigms we can extrapolate that, regardless of whether language cues or stimuli are presented, switching languages usually contains a performance cost (i.e., switch costs and/or mixing costs). Thus, we conclude that performance costs in experimental language switching are a common empirical observation in all variants of language switching, with the exception of voluntary language switching under certain circumstances (Gollan & Ferreira, 2009; Gollan, Kleinman, et al., 2014). Next to this commonality, each paradigm comes with its own advantages and disadvantages.",1
17,12,"The cued language switching paradigm, for example, can rely on a large amount and variety of research on language switching in language production tasks (as comprehension tasks usually do not implement cues, research is much more limited in this domain). Hence, we have extensive knowledge of the effects and processes at work during cued language switching.",1
17,13,"Another advantage of the cued language switching paradigm are the modifications of several time-based intervals, such as the cue-to-stimulus interval, which is assumed to measure active language preparation, and the response-to-cue interval, which is assumed to measure passive decay (e.g., Kiesel et al., 2010). These time-based intervals cannot be manipulated as easily in the other language switching paradigms.",1
17,14,"The alternating language switching paradigm allows for language preplanning, as the bilingual knows when switching to another language will occur, which is similar to preplanning during natural language production. Hence, he or she could prepare for the upcoming language based on the predictable sequence.",1
17,15,"Even closer to natural language switching in this respect is the voluntary language switching paradigm because it does not rely on exogenous language cues but on endogenous (i.e., internal) language cues and thus also allows for language preplanning. Additionally, the voluntary language switching paradigm allows for other measures, namely when and how often bilinguals will switch between languages. These additional measures could give us more insight into the mechanism of language control during language switching.",1
17,16,"Finally, the SBLS paradigm also allows for sequential predictability of language control. Yet, whereas this is restricted to language predictability in the alternating language switching and voluntary language switching paradigms, it encompasses the entire word in the SBLS paradigm. Another advantage of this paradigm is that all word categories can be investigated, since the memory-based concept sequence allows for a large variety of words. Yet, this is also possible with other paradigms when they employ written words.",1
17,17,"Taken together, a large variety of language switching paradigms with individual strengths and weaknesses can be used to study language control in language switching. The common idea of all of the paradigms is that they allow researchers to explore how language control operates and which processes play a crucial role in language switching.",1
17,18,"An influential model of language control is the inhibitory control model (ICM; Green, 1998), which explains switch costs with the notion of persisting inhibition: when on a trial (trial n1) a certain language has to be produced, the non-target language will be inhibited. In turn, when the previously inhibited language is required for production on the next trial (trial n; i.e., switch trial), the inhibition that was exercised on trial n-1 will persist into trial n and thus will have to be overcome. This is not the case when producing in the same language on trial n-1 and trial n (i.e., repetition trial). So, it should be harder to switch between languages than repeating the same language because persisting inhibition has to be overcome in switch trials. Green also assumed that the inhibitory process is reactive, meaning that a larger activation will lead to more inhibition.",1
17,19,"Whereas the ICM is more production-based, the bilingual interactive activation model (BIA; Grainger & Dijkstra, 1992), and later variants of this model, such as the BIA+ (Dijkstra & van Heuven, 2002) or the BIA-d (Grainger, Midgley, & Holcomb, 2010), focused on comprehensionbased language control. This model can account for switch costs by bottom-up activation of word representations to language nodes, which are mental language representations, and top-down inhibition of the irrelevant and, thus, competing language (node). During a switch trial another language node needs to be activated, and in turn interferes with processing, whereas during repetition trials the same language node is activated and thus processing can occur without language interference. Consequently, switch costs should occur.",1
17,20,"Next to these inhibition-based models there are also language control models that do not rely on inhibition (e.g., Costa, Miozzo, & Caramazza, 1999; Finkbeiner et al., 2006; La Heij, 2005; Roelofs, 1998). La Heij (2005), for example, proposed that a language representation of the target language receives additional activation from a corresponding language cue, thus making inhibition redundant.",1
17,21,"While the latter models propose that no inhibition occurs during language switching, inhibition has been suggested as an explanation for several language switching measures, such as asymmetrical switch costs, n-2 language repetition costs, and reversed language proficiency in mixed language blocks. In the following subsections we will discuss these markers and their relation to inhibition.",1
17,22,"A first concern is that several studies did not find asymmetrical switch costs (e.g., Christoffels et al., 2007; Verhoef et al., 2010; for reversed asymmetrical switch costs, see Declerck, Stephan, et al., 2015b), an observation that has also been found in task switching (for a review, see Koch, Gade, Schuch, & Philipp, 2010). This is especially marked in comprehension studies, where typically no asymmetrical switch costs are observed (e.g., Macizo et al., 2012; Thomas & Allport, 2000). Furthermore, symmetrical switch costs are usually observed with highly proficient bilinguals in production tasks (e.g., Costa & Santesteban, 2004; Costa, Santesteban, & Ivanova, et al., 2006). This finding is conceived as evidence that highly proficient bilinguals do not use inhibition during language control (for a more detailed discussion on highly proficient bilinguals and inhibition see below). Hence, asymmetrical switch costs seem to depend on the type of task and on the bilinguals.",1
17,23,"This unclear pattern raises some questions about the reactive inhibitory nature of language control in language switching. Yet, to reconcile the idea of reactive inhibition, language dominance and overall naming speed, one might suggest that language dominance influences the asymmetry of switch costs at an earlier processing stage in language processing than the overall naming speed is influenced (cf. Declerck, Thoma, Koch, & Philipp, 2015c).",1
17,24,"A final, more theoretical, concern is that asymmetrical switch costs can also be explained with mechanisms different from inhibition. For example, the notion of reactive activation (Philipp et al., 2007) entails that L2 requires a relatively larger amount of activation than L1 on trial n-1. This increase of activation will persist into trial n, thus causing a more considerable competitor for L1 than L2 on switch trials. So, asymmetrical switch costs can be explained without the notion of inhibition, using a similar logic as Green (1998) proposed.1 Yet, this interpretation comes with similar concerns as the ICM.",1
17,25,"A different interpretation of asymmetrical switch costs proposes that the initial response of switch trials can be rejected when these are too fast (Finkbeiner et al., 2006). This is meant to prevent errors, as switch trials are supposed to be difficult and thus no fast responses can be given in this difficult situation. Since L1 trials are more dominant, they are generally also easier and thus faster. Hence, more initial L1 switch responses will be rejected than L2 switch responses, leading to larger L1 than L2 switch costs.",1
17,26,"The final account of asymmetrical switch costs was proposed by Verhoef et al. (2009). These authors speculated that the switch cost asymmetry across languages is due to a larger L1-repetition benefit than L2-repetition benefit. This interpretation comes from the assumption that interference of the nontarget language influences all trial types except L1 repetition trials, which are thus always the fastest. To test this hypothesis, Verhoef and colleagues investigated the effect of language preparation time on asymmetrical switch costs. More specifically, they manipulated the cue-to-stimulus interval, which allows for more (long interval) or less (short interval) language preparation. Their results showed that longer language preparation led to symmetrical switch costs with DutchEnglish bilinguals, whereas short language preparation led to asymmetrical switch costs. Furthermore, they found that all trials benefited from longer language preparation time, apart from L1-repetition trials. The latter finding is an indication that all trial types, apart from the L1-repetition trials, suffer from language interference.",1
17,27,"Yet, no preparation-based difference in asymmetrical switch costs was found in other language switching studies that investigated the effect of language preparation (Costa & Santesteban, 2004; Declerck et al., 2015a; Fink & Goldrick, 2015; Philipp et al., 2007). Furthermore, Fink and Goldrick (2015) also looked into the effect of language preparation time on L1 repetition trials. According to Verhoef et al. (2009) these types of trials should be unaffected by language preparation. In contrast, Fink and Goldrick (2015) observed a preparation benefit for these trials. Taken together, the lack of replication of Verhoef et al.¡¯s (2009) behavioral findings seems to put into question the idea that L1 repetition trials are not affected by language interference. Consequently, the idea of an L1-repetition benefit to explain asymmetrical switch costs should be reexamined.",1
17,28,"Taken together, there are several different explanations to account for the switch cost asymmetry, but each of these explanations seems to fall short to account for the observed language switching data. This begs the question of what asymmetrical switch costs really measure. Philipp et al. (2007) have argued that asymmetrical switch costs could be explained by more than one process. Specifically, they argued that a combination of persisting activation and a small role for persisting inhibition could explain most results. We concur with the idea that asymmetrical switch costs might be the sum of more than one process and thus not an ideal measure for solely persisting, reactive inhibition.",1
17,29,"Unlike asymmetrical switch costs, n-2 language repetition costs cannot be explained by persisting activation, since an opposite pattern would be observed (i.e., n-2 language repetition benefit). Further, up to now, there is no alternative explanation for n-2 language repetition costs (for a review of n-2 repetition costs in task switching, see Koch et al., 2010), which makes this a less ambiguous marker for the notion of inhibition in language switching.",1
17,30,"Yet, similar to switch costs, the specific pattern of n-2 repetition costs across languages is not consistent. Both Philipp et al. (2007) and Guo et al. (2013a, Experiment 1) observed an asymmetry of n-2 language repetition costs across languages with larger L1 n-2 language repetition costs than with L3. However, no such effect was observed in the second Experiment of Guo and colleagues and in either experiment of Philipp and Koch (2009). Furthermore, only Philipp et al. (2007) observed larger L1 n-2 language repetition costs than with L2. Moreover, while Guo and colleagues (Experiments 1 and 2) found larger L2 n-2 language repetition costs than with L3, Philipp et al. (2007) found an opposite effect. This mixed data pattern does not speak against persisting inhibition as n-2 repetition costs were consistently found. Yet, we suppose that this data pattern indicates that there are multiple influences on language activation (e.g., language dominance, recency of language use,¡­) and its relation to inhibition. Moreover, the complexity of the data pattern might also indicate that different loci of inhibition could play a role (e.g., Bobb & Wodniecka, 2013; Gollan, Schotter, Gomez, Murillo, & Rayner, 2014; Kroll, Bobb, & Wodniecka, 2006), and that the involvement of specific loci is dependent on the level of language activation. Consequently, different patterns of performance costs can be observed across languages in different studies due to differences in language activation.",1
17,42,"This also leads to an important question¡ªnamely, whether solely inhibition is required for language control or whether other processes, such as activation (Philipp et al., 2007), also play an important role during language control. The implementation of several processes (e.g., inhibition and activation) during language switching could very well be the case even though evidence for inhibition has been found in language switching, because inhibition and activation are not mutually exclusive processes. These different types of language control processes could also occur at different processing stages of language processing (Bobb & Wodniecka 2013; Gollan, Schotter, et al., 2014; Kroll et al., 2006). Regrettably, mainly inhibition has been used to explain language switching results, while other processes have been mostly ignored. So, at this point the involvement of processes other than inhibition remains unclear, making research into this field an important avenue for future research",1
17,43,"The conclusion that bilingual language control appears to rely, at least partially, on inhibitory processes, is not specific to the question of what is inhibited in language control and when this inhibition occurs. Language processing, both in language production and language comprehension, entails different processing stages and each of these processing stages could play a crucial role for language control.",1
17,44,"Spoken word production (e.g., Levelt, Roelofs, & Meyer, 1999) starts with the formation of a nonlinguistic concept, at which stage the to-be-expressed information is formed. Next, syntactic information is included at the lemma level, followed by the addition of sound representations at the phonological level. Finally, articulation occurs, which involves activation of the necessary muscles.",1
7,1," The effects of testing on memory are well-known, but the specific ways in which testing negatively impacts memory are not fully understood. The study focuses on ""output interference"" (OI), which refers to a decrease in accuracy that occurs over the course of testing. While OI has been researched in relation to episodic memory, there has been limited exploration of its impact on semantic memory. In the study, participants were tested twice on their factual knowledge and received corrective feedback during the first test. OI was not observed during the first test, but it was present during the second test, particularly for questions that had been answered incorrectly during the first test. This suggests that episodic memory is more susceptible to interference than semantic memory. Possible explanations for this finding are discussed.",0

Understanding the importance of testing and its use as a learning tool is crucial, especially as high-stakes testing becomes more prevalent in education. What is particularly intriguing about the benefits of testing is the difference in the impact of information learned through testing compared to the same amount of time spent solely studying. For example, individuals tend to retain information better if they complete a free recall test as opposed to simply reviewing the material (Karpicke & Roediger, 2008; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006a). Despite the reliable and robust benefits of testing (see Delaney, Verkoeijen, & Spirgel, 2010; Karpicke, Lehman, & Aue, 2014; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006b for reviews), there are also negative consequences associated with testing (see Malmberg, Lehman, Annis, Criss, & Shiffrin, 2014). For instance, recalling a subset of memorized items based on a specific cue during a test may impede the retrieval of other items from the same group (Malmberg, Criss, Gangwani, & Shiffrin, 2012; Roediger, 1973; Slamecka, 1968). One significant drawback of testing is the finding that performance decreases throughout the test list (Criss, Malmberg, & Shiffrin, 2011; Murdock & Anderson, 1975; Ratcliff & Hockley, 1980; Roediger, 1974; Roediger & Schmidt, 1980). This phenomenon, called ""output interference"" (OI), is thought to occur as a result of encoding during the test, either through updating existing memories with new information gained during testing or by adding new traces to episodic memory. As a result, items tested toward the end of the test list may suffer from additional interference generated by the new information added to memory throughout the testing process (Criss et al., 2011).",0
7,14," The study found that output interference (OI) varied depending on whether it was the first or second time the questions were answered. No OI was observed during the initial test, but a strong OI effect was seen during the second test, where participants had received corrective feedback. This effect was mostly limited to questions that were answered incorrectly on the first test. The authors suggested that this suggests that OI is primarily associated with episodic memory.",0

9,1," The paradox of crying's mood-enhancing benefits in retrospective studies and its negative effects on mood in quasi-experimental laboratory studies is explained by the fact that criers experience an initial deterioration in mood immediately after crying, followed by a recovery that results in even better mood enhancement than non-criers. This was determined through a study of 28 objectively established criers and 32 non-criers who watched an emotional movie and rated their mood before and after the film, as well as 20 and 90 minutes later. While crying frequency did not predict the extent of mood changes, the observed relation between crying and mood recovery supports earlier retrospective studies.",0
9,2," Humans possess the unique ability to cry emotional tears, a behavior commonly observed and culturally prevalent (Trimble 2012; Vingerhoets 2013; Vingerhoets and Bylsma 2015). Despite this, there has been scant attention from researchers, and the understanding of its purpose remains limited. The theories regarding the functions of crying can be divided into two categories (Vingerhoets 2013; Vingerhoets et al. 2009). Firstly, the catharsis effect theory highlights the individual benefits of crying and its ability to promote recovery and homeostasis. Secondly, the inter-individual functions of crying focus on communication of helplessness and the need for support, leading to comfort and succor (Hasson 2009). These positions are not mutually exclusive and receiving emotional support may contribute to an improved sense of wellbeing. Crying could be viewed as a form of coping behavior, serving to facilitate emotional recovery and persuading others to act, from the perspective of stress theory (Vingerhoets 2013).",0
9,3,"

When attempting to clarify contradictory results, it is crucial to consider certain methodological issues. In studies that rely on retrospectively reported data, participants are generally allowed to choose which crying episodes they want to describe, which could skew the results. There is a concern that individuals may have a preference for reporting crying experiences that align with the common belief that crying can lead to feeling better. Another issue with this type of study is that participants usually report their feelings following crying without specifying the precise timeframe. While it may be difficult for participants to recall the exact sequence of mood changes, it is possible that people experience a temporary dip in their mood before experiencing a subsequent mood improvement after crying. Given that we lack detailed information on how mood changes unfold after crying, we are unable to fully understand the common notion that crying leads to emotional recovery.",0
9,4," The study aims to investigate the impact of crying on mood in a controlled laboratory environment. To ensure the findings are applicable to a wider population, a diverse range of stimuli that elicit both negative and positive emotions will be employed. Based on previous research, the study hypothesizes that individuals who cry in response to the emotional films will experience a more substantial increase in negative affect immediately after viewing compared to those who do not cry. Additionally, the study anticipates that individuals who cry will experience greater overall mood improvement in delayed measurements, including recovery from initial mood deterioration. Finally, the study expects that the number of crying episodes will correlate with changes in negative affect over time.",0

The items included nervous, bad-tempered, anxious, weepy, tense, guilty, helpless, sad, angry, miserable, rejected, fearful, cheerful, generous, relaxed, calm, active, and merry (last six items were reversely keyed). Adequate internal consistency was observed, with the Cronbachâs alphas ranging from .77 to .84 over the four measurements.",0

Once the participants signed the informed consent form, they were asked to complete the first mood rating (T1), following which they were randomly exposed to one of two films. After watching the film, the participants were asked to fill in a short questionnaire on their emotional responses, not relevant to the scope of the study. Thereafter, the second mood measurement (T2) was taken, following which the participants were accompanied by the experimenter to another room, where they completed additional questionnaires, also not relevant to the study. 20 minutes post T2, the participants completed the mood questionnaire for the third time (T3). The participants were provided with instructions and an envelope containing the mood scale, which they were requested to complete and return immediately after receiving an SMS via mobile phone. The fourth mood measurement (T4) was taken 90 minutes after the second one and 60 minutes post leaving the laboratory, without any instructions given on behavior until T4. Participants responded to the mood scale items on T4 via text message, sending 18 numbers to the experimenter.",0

Two separate ANOVAs were performed to analyze changes within each group and Bonferroni post hoc tests were used to compare NA between specific measurements. An additional ANOVA was also performed to validate the possibility of low mood in criers stimulating successful mood enhancing behaviors. Covariates used were age, gender, and NA change from T1 to T2.",0

To prepare the data for regression analyses, the frequency of crying episodes (FCE) variable was created by aggregating the crying measure across all observed scenes with crying. Three multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine if FCE predicted changes in negative affect (NA) at relevant points in time. The first block of each analysis included age, gender, and NA at T1 as predictors, while FCE was included as a predictor in the second block. The effects of FCE (i.e. the second block) are reported here. To prevent the inflation of the effects of crying, only crying participants were included in these regression analyses.",0
9,10," Based on the data presented in Figure 1, our hypothesis about distinct mood changes in the crying and noncrying group was confirmed. This is supported by a significant main effect of time [F(3, 53) = 5.64; p = .002; partial g2 = .09] and a significant time by group interaction [F(2, 36) = 5.11; p = .003; partial g2 = .08].

Meanwhile, the criers group showed a significant effect of time on their NA, where it increased from T1 to T2 and decreased from T2 to T3 and T4. The decrease in NA from T1 to T4 in the criers group was significant, indicating overall mood improvements following crying. The predicted NA decrease remained significant even when NA change from T1 to T2 was included as a covariate. Bonferroni correction was applied during post hoc comparisons.",0

Regions in the DLPFC and BG that exhibited a noteworthy reward context effect had two distinct outcomes. The top section of Table 4 indicated that these areas had reduced target-related activation on RC compared to RCXT or BCXT trials. Specifically, decreased target-related activation was observed in the medial portion of the right DLPFC during RC and RCXT trials, when compared to BCXT trials. However, the study noted that certain subcortical regions, such as the lateral globus pallidus, did not show significant variations in target-related activity in Time Point 4. However, Time Point 7 had a greater deactivation on RC than BCXT and RCXT trials. The lower section of the table demonstrated that other larger, more lateral, and posterior areas in the DLPFC exhibited more activation on RC than BCXT trials. Further, Supplemental Fig. 2 presented the time courses of each region in the DLPFC.",0
10,18," The study found that the activation in the bilateral DLPFC and various subcortical regions related to reward, such as the lateral globus pallidus and caudate, increased when presented with incentive cues as compared to no-incentive cues. This result was consistent with previous studies that also showed increases in a network of regions involved in cognitive control, such as the lateral PFC and parietal cortex. (Owen, McMillan, Laird, & Bullmore, 2005; Wager & Smith, 2003; Padmala & Pessoa, 2011; Vassena et al., 2014).",0
10,19," The DLPFC, recognized as a vital part of cognitive control, has been found to represent both reward-related value and task goals. Studies have shown that it is strongly connected to regions that are involved in value representations, such as the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. The DLPFC also projects to the BG, including the caudate nucleus and globus pallidus, with projections terminating in the thalamus, which in turn, projects back to the DLPFC and premotor and motor cortices. Increased DLPFC and striatal activations in response to incentive cues may indicate enhanced neural representations of reward value through a top-down regulation of activations in this circuit.",0
10,20,"

The study found that specific regions in the BG displayed increased activity during reward situations, which builds on previous research indicating that fronto-parietal networks can show sustained elevation in relation to reward information. While earlier studies showed sustained increases in the parietal cortex and PFC in reward contexts, they did not observe effects in the BG. This study used a targeted ROI method, whereas previous studies employed voxelwise whole-brain analysis, which may have made it easier to detect sustained effects in both prefrontal and striatal regions. This prolonged activity may reflect the BG's hypothesized contribution to reward-based learning and goal-oriented behavior. More specifically, the dorsal striatum receives widespread inputs from the DLPFC and other frontal regions, and prolonged activity in this area during reward contexts may indicate an attempt to maintain information relevant to obtaining rewards, improving preparation throughout the reward situation.",0
10,21," The study found that individuals with greater trait anhedonia had less neural activation when presented with reward-predicting cues, but there was no significant relationship between anhedonia and sustained context-dependent activation during reward contexts. This supports the idea that anhedonia affects the experience of rewards and how they alter brain activation and behavior in response to explicit presentation of reward cues. However, it does not support the notion that anhedonia affects global effects of incentives in sustained brain activation or behavioral effects. These findings suggest that individual differences in anhedonia may impact goal-directed behavior due to a lack of positive experiences/expectations of rewards.",0
10,22," The study offers valuable insights into a potential neural mechanism that underlies anhedonia. However, it has certain limitations that may be addressed in future studies. For instance, the researchers did not observe significant reductions in conflict effects in either accuracy or RT. Although they found an increase in RT as a result of reward, there was no compromise in accuracy. Furthermore, the team concentrated their analyses on the DLPFC and the basal ganglia and did not detect any regions exhibiting interaction effects of reward context and trial type in the target phase. While it is not possible to rule out the possibility that the present task may have been too challenging for individuals outside of a clinical population and detrimental to their cognitive control, future studies should explore the difficulty level of performance tasks. In conclusion, the findings show both persistent context-dependent and temporary cue-driven impacts of reward on cognitive control, which the DLPFC and basal ganglia are believed to support. A notable discovery is that self-reported anhedonia trait in healthy adults is linked to temporary neural activity in the lateral globus pallidus during reward predictions but not with sustained DLPFC activity.",0
10,23," The fixed-order presentation of the baseline and reward conditions may have caused a sustained context-dependent effect, but it is unlikely that the differences between reward conditions were due to practice effects. Previous empirical evidence shows that reward incentives have a consistent effect on cognitive control, as seen in the AX-continuous performance task. The differences between RCXT and RC trials are also unlikely to be due to practice effects, as these trials were interleaved.",0
10,24," The current state-item design enabled the separation of sustained and transient effects of rewards to some extent. However, to further distinguish these effects, additional methods could be implemented in future research. Specifically, the current design did not allow for the estimation of sustained rewards in trials lacking transient effects. As an alternative, future studies could incorporate conditions in which participants were informed about a bonus at the end of a set of trials and no individual reward cues. This would produce a crossed design that tests the effects of the overall sustained reward manipulation and trial-specific reward manipulation.",0

They also examined childhood factors that could predict the stability of comorbid psychiatric disorders. The rate of comorbid psychiatric disorders decreased from childhood (81%) to adolescence (61%).

This finding was not aligned with our expectation of higher self-reported rates of internalizing problems. However, we did find a slightly higher rate of self-reported depressive symptoms (18.2% - subclinical range), as opposed to the parent-reported DISC-P wave 2 rate of 10.8%, which was in line with our expectation.

12,1," In two separate experiments, rats were exposed to the taste of almond in combination with either fructose or maltodextrin. The rats' preference for the taste of almond was then evaluated, with half of the rats having prior exposure to the taste on its own, and the other half having no prior exposure. Experiment 1 showed that when the rats were hungry during the test, nonpreexposed subjects had a greater preference for the taste of almond, regardless of whether they were trained with fructose or maltodextrin. This indicates that latent inhibition was present with both reinforcers. In Experiment 2, when the rats were not food deprived prior to the test, there was no latent inhibition observed for either reinforcer. Instead, the preference was greater for preexposed subjects than for nonpreexposed subjects. The results do not provide evidence for the idea that different types of reinforcers promote different types of learning. Instead, they suggest that different forms of learning control behavior when a rat is hungry versus when it is not, and that the form that generates the preference in the latter case is not susceptible to the latent inhibition effect.",0
12,2," In classical conditioning, prior exposure to the event used as the conditioned stimulus (CS) typically slows down the acquisition of the conditioned response. This phenomenon is known as latent inhibition and has been observed in various conditioning procedures. However, the flavor-preference conditioning procedure used in these experiments has shown an exception to this rule. Rats were given a nonpreferred flavor in combination with a sucrose solution, and after training, they demonstrated an increased preference for the flavored water. Exposure to the CS before conditioning produced different results, with some studies showing a reduction in preference and others showing no effect.",0
12,3," Several mechanisms can contribute to the preference established with sucrose as the US. Sucrose has a sweet taste and also has nutritive postoral consequences, which makes each property capable of promoting preference conditioning. A non-nutritive substance like saccharin can serve as an effective US using flavor-taste learning. Additionally, a preference can also develop when a nutrient US is delivered through intragastric infusion known as flavor-nutrient learning. Sucrose supports both forms of learning as it helps create a preference regardless of its taste properties.",0
12,4," To examine the findings of Garcia-Burgos et al. (2013), it would be beneficial to have specific procedures in place that permit the separate inspection of flavor-nutrient and flavor-taste learning. This would help to demonstrate latent inhibition in the former case and not in the latter. Although some preliminary insights have been gained from unconventional methodologies, they are not conclusive. In particular, Weingarten and Kulikovsky (1989) suggested that the pre-exposure to a flavor impedes the association between flavor and food after rats responded to sham-feeding experiments. Conversely, Galef and Durlach's (1993) research involving the demonstration of food flavor by one rat to another yielded opposite results. These studies are suggestive and consistent with the theory under consideration, but alternative conclusions could exist. Therefore, this study aims to standardize preference conditioning techniques and employ non-sucrose-based USs to isolate flavor-nutrient and flavor-taste education.",0
12,5," The effects of different USs may be more complex than stated. Intragastric fructose can lead to preference learning but to a lesser extent than sucrose. Myers and Sclafani found that rats responded positively to flavors associated with sugar infusion, indicating that flavor-nutrient learning could impact the hedonic response to a flavor. Despite this, comparing fructose with maltodextrin has been successful in studying flavor-preference learning. The study aimed to find latent inhibition in rats trained with either fructose or maltodextrin as the US, which could support the hypothesis that different mechanisms create preferences established by these USs. If there's a difference with maltodextrin but not fructose, it confirms that the mechanism of fructose, presumed to be flavor-taste learning, isn't susceptible to latent inhibition.",0
12,6," During the study, four groups of rats were created. Two groups were given preexposure to the almond flavor that was going to be used as the CS, while the other two groups received only water during this stage. In the conditioning stage, one pair of groups consumed a mixture of almond and fructose, and the other pair consumed a mixture of almond and maltodextrin. In the final test, all subjects had access to two bottles, one containing the almond solution, and the other containing unflavored water. To ensure that rats would drink the fluids provided, they were deprived of water throughout training. Although the rats had free access to food during preexposure and conditioning, food access was denied to all subjects before the test to determine the preference based on flavor-nutrient learning, which is more evident in hungry animals.",0

The University of Granada Ethics Committee approved all experimental procedures. The deprivation schedule began by removing water bottles 24 hours before the experiment, and the rats were given three days to adjust to the twice-daily water access schedule. The rats were divided into two weight-matched groups for the flavor exposure phase: group Pre (n = 16) and group NPre (n = 16). During the phase, the rats were given 10 ml of either almond (Pre) or water (NPre) once daily for eight days, followed by free water access. Afterward, the rats were split into four groups based on their almond or water consumption for the conditioning phase: Pre/M (n = 8), NPre/M (n = 8), Pre/F (n = 8), and NPre/F (n = 8).",0
12,8," After two days of conditioning, each day with one trial in the morning session, the rats were given 10 minutes to access 10 ml of either almond + maltodextrin (groups M) or almond + fructose (groups F). To prevent any pairing of the flavor with the standard diet, food was removed during this time. After the last conditioning session, the rats were given a second 30-minute access to water at 5:30 p.m. instead of 1:30 p.m., and food was removed at 6:00 p.m. On the next day, the rats were tested while food-deprived with 15-minute access to two bottles at 10:00 a.m. containing 20 ml of almond solution and 20 ml of water, respectively. The positions of the bottles were counterbalanced across groups.",0
12,14," The figure in the right of Fig. 1 shows the mean preference ratios for each group, now renamed as TTT. The scores for maltodextrin were slightly higher than for fructose. Contrary to the results of Experiment 1, the groups preexposed to almond displayed a higher preference for almond regardless of the reinforcer. This unexpected reversal of the latent inhibition effect led to significant main effects of preexposure and reinforcer on the preference ratios, according to ANOVA results. The main effect of preexposure yielded F(1, 28) = 5.17, p = .031, Î·p 2 = .16, and the main effect of reinforcer had F(1, 28) = 5.48, p = .027, Î·p 2 = .16, while the interaction was not significant (F < 1).",0
