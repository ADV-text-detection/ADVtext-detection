1,1,"Extant research supports the hypothesis that biometric indicators of life history (LH) strategy, such as the timing of sexual debut, are calibrated in response to cues sampled early in development (before age 7). Herein, we theorize that the experience of sexual debut itself may further calibrate women¡¯s LH-related behavioral phenotypes across adolescence by modulating subsequent investment in mating effort, which is associated with faster (vs. slower) LH speed. We tested this hypothesis using longitudinal data, which included Q-Sort LH scores at ages 14, 18, and 23, and a report of whether or not sexual debut occurred between ages 14 and 18. Results demonstrated that women (but not men) who experienced their sexual debut between the ages of 14 and 18 showed greater relative acceleration of LH speed during this period than women who had not debuted by age 18. However, these same effects had weakened by age 23¡ªwhich underscores the broader idea that LH-related behavioral phenotypes exhibit substantial cue-based plasticity across adolescence and into adulthood. Although alternative explanations for the observed patterns remain unfalsified, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that developmental LH trajectory is regulated in relation to the timing of sexual debut in adolescence. This possibility could be further investigated in future research",1
1,2,"Life history (LH) theory originated as an explanation for changes in organisms¡¯ reproductive strategies under conditions of increasing environmental constraints (Pianka 1970) with a rapid or quantity reproductive strategy predominating with loose constraints and a more restrained quality reproductive strategy prevailing as constraints tightened. Promislow and Harvey (1990) proposed that these strategies accounted for a collation of differences between species, finding significant covariance amongst such indices as rate of maturation, litter size, and maternal investment in offspring. Similarly, LH theory was applied to human group (Rushton 1985) and individual differences (Draper and Harpending 1982) such that individual differences in rate of maturation, sexual debut, and parental investment covary forming LH strategies between people. Individual differences in LH strategy are now described as varying in speed along a fast to slow continuum. Faster LH strategies are defined by earlier maturation and sexual debut, higher frequency of sexual intercourse with less stable pair bonds, and reduced parental investment. Slow LH strategies are defined by later maturation and sexual debut, lower frequency of sexual intercourse with more stable pair bonds, and increased parental investment.",1
1,3,"The earliest models on the development of LH strategies stressed the critical influence of early childhood experiences that would have predicted LH-relevant environmental parameters across human ancestral environments (Belsky et al. 1991; Draper and  Harpending 1982; Ellis et al. 2003). For example, Belsky et al. (1991) proposed that the quality of parental attachment in childhood is the key determinant in calibrating developmental trajectories toward a fast or slow LH strategy. Secure parental attachment guides development down the path of a slow LH strategy, with the corresponding phenotypic traits geared toward investment in future reproduction via delayed maturation and sexual debut. Alternatively, insecure parental attachment leads to a fast LH strategy with early maturation and earlier sexual debut, unstable pair bonds, and low parental investment in offspring. At several points in their article, Belsky et al. (1991) reiterate Draper and Harpending's (1982) position that early childhood experiences (explicitly stated as occurring in the first 5¨C7 years of life) are critical in setting the fast (called Type I in the article) or slow (called Type II in the article) developmental trajectories. This position is summarized in the following quote from the article",1
1,4,"A central tenet of the theory we advance is that a principal evolutionary function of early experience¡ªthe first 5¨C7 years of life¡ªis to induce in the child an understanding of the availability and predictability of resources (broadly defined) in the environment, of the trustworthiness of others, and of the enduringness of close interpersonal relationships, all of which will affect how the developing person apportions reproductive effort.",1
1,5,"The position that there is a critical period wherein LH strategy crystalizes in the middle of the first decade may be too strong. While recognizing a significant degree of heritability in LH strategy (Figueredo et al. 2004), additional research and advancing theory on the development of LH strategies in reaction to proximate somatic (Nettle et al. 2013; von Rueden et al. 2015) and environmental (e.g., Brumbach et al. 2009) cues both suggest that significant plasticity in LH strategies remains after the 5¨C7 years of age period identified by Belsky et al. (1991). On the other hand, the issue of the importance of early versus late developmental experience in helping shape LH strategy remains an open question with some findings pointing to the importance of early experiences relative to those experienced later in life. For example, Simpson et al. (2012) found that the level of environmental predictability experienced in the first 5 years of life had a significant effect on LH strategy at age 23, but the level of environmental predictability experienced in later childhood and adolescence did not.",1
1,6,"The most comprehensive model on how factors beyond the age of seven may impact LH strategies has been proposed by Del Giudice (2009), who suggested that early adolescence, specifically adrenarche, acts as an additional switch point in the development of LH strategies. This idea has been advanced further by Ellis et al. (2012) and Del Giudice and Belsky (2011), both of whom extended the putative period of cue-based plasticity through puberty and into later adolescence. In support of the idea that LH strategy may be continually adjusted across development, well past the age 5 to 7 period, Dunkel et al. (2015) recently found that maternal authoritative parenting received during adolescence uniquely predicted later LH strategy above and beyond the calibration effects of maternal behavior in early childhood.",1
1,7,"The current investigation further explores the idea of continued plasticity in the development of LH strategy in adolescence. To that end, we examined another possible contributing factor in developing LH strategies during adolescence: sexual debut (i.e., age of first sex). While sexual debut has most often been used as a type of dependent variable, the timing of which is indicative of LH strategy (see Ellis et al. 2003), there is precedence indicating that it may also serve as an LH cue acting to calibrate LH speed. For example, Vigil et al. (2005) tested the possibility that childhood sexual abuse accelerates LH speed. Vigil et al. (2005) surveyed over 600 women between the ages of 18 and 56 from the Midwestern and Southwestern USA concerning whether or not they experienced childhood sexual abuse, assessed by the single item ¡°I was sexually abused before age 14,¡± and the subsequent ages at which they experienced a number of indicators of LH strategy (e.g., sexual debut). While, as recognized by Vigil et al. (2005), childhood sexual abuse differs from consensual intercourse later in life in many clear and important ways, the authors proposed that the act of intercourse itself may be one reason why childhood sexual abuse accelerates LH speed. Indeed, they found that women who reported being victims of childhood sexual abuse also reported earlier menarche, earlier timing of first consensual intercourse, and giving birth to their first child earlier in life.",1
1,8,"Thus, the primary hypothesis of the present study is that sexual debut accelerates LH speed. The general prediction that LH strategy is facultatively calibrated in ontogeny only holds to the degree that particular developmental cues were ancestrally valid predictors of variable world states (Frankenhius and Panchanathan 2011). Although certain aspects of early environment may contain some valid LH-relevant information, recent theoretical work suggests that internal (e.g., somatic) cues may in many cases have much higher cue validities than external cues (Nettle et al. 2013). This would be especially true for internal cues associated with sexual debut (e.g., psychological experience of having sex; ¡°breaking¡± of the hymen), which provide highly valid information regarding one¡¯s actual progression into a sexually active developmental stage wherein it would have been ancestrally functional to invest in reproductive effort (at the expense of investment in growth, etc.). If so, selection may have favored facultative adaptations designed to accelerate LH speed in response to sexual debut in adolescence, such that the loss of virginity promotes investment in current reproduction via increased allocation of resources toward mating effort.",1
1,9,"Given that the transition from virginity to sexual activity entails much greater potential costs for females than males (Trivers 1972), the tradeoff between growth and reproduction as a function of virginity loss would have been especially pronounced among ancestral women (Vigil et al. 2005). We correspondingly predict that sexual debut will accelerate LH speed to a greater degree in adolescent females than males. We examine these predictions using data from a longitudinal study conducted by Block and Block (2006a) which includes both repeated measures of LH strategy from adolescence and into adulthood based on the California Adult Q-sort (Block 1978; Sherman et al. 2013) and information concerning the timing of sexual debut.",1
1,10,"The Block and Block data (2006b) and documentation files were downloaded via the internet from the Henry A. Murray Research Archive. The Block and Block longitudinal study lasted 30 years with multiple waves of data collection and extensive testing taking place at each wave. Participants were initially recruited from two preschools in Berkeley, CA, when they were 3 to 4 years of age. Demographic information including participant sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status was obtained from data files in the first wave of data collection.",1
1,11,"Data from waves at ages 14, 18, and 23 were also used in the analyses. Because the investigation concerned the transition in LH strategy from age 14 to ages 18 and 23, age 14 serves as the base year for the analyses. At age 14, the sample included 106 participants, of which 54 were female (51 %). Of the 106 participants, 71 were White, 27 were Black, 5 were Asian-American, and 4 were classified as ¡°Other.¡± Due to the small number of non-Black minorities, participants were grouped as White (67 %) and non-White (33 %).",1
1,12,"LH strategy was measured using the California Q-sort (CAQ; Block 1978). The CAQ includes a set of 100 items, and the items are to be Q-sorted or arranged in piles based upon the degree to which they describe an individual. Sherman et al. (2013) developed an LH strategy template allowing LH strategy to be measured using the CAQ, and this measure was recently validated and slightly modified by Dunkel et al. (2014) using the Block and Block data.",1
1,13,"At ages 14, 18, and 23 between four and six, trained raters independently used the CAQ to rate each participant¡¯s personality. The aggregate of these ratings was then correlated with the LH strategy template. The correlation of the participants¡¯sort with the template is their score. Higher scores (i.e., stronger correlations) represent a slower LH strategy. A sample item that is reflective of slow LH speed is ¡°sympathetic/considerate.¡± A sample item reflective of fast LH speed is ¡°unable to delay gratification.¡±",1
1,14,"At age 18, participants responded either in the affirmative or negative as to whether they had ¡°lost their virginity¡± within the last 3 years. Forty-two participants indicated that they had ¡°lost their virginity¡± in the last 3 years and 60 participants reported that they had not.",1
1,15,"Sex, ethnicity (dichotomized as White and nonWhite due to small sample size), and socioeconomic status (SES), measured by Warner¡¯s Index of SES (1949) when participants were 4 years of age, were demographic covariates.",1
1,16,"In addition to the demographic covariates, we included four other covariates: intelligence, maternal and paternal parenting style, and the relationship to the person with whom the participants had intercourse for the first time. Intelligence was measured at age 18 by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). Intelligence was included as a covariate to control for the influence of the participants¡¯ cognitive ability, which could plausibly limit one¡¯s ability to reason about the potential consequences of consenting to intercourse. Maternal and paternal authoritative parenting was measured by the Child Rearing Practices Report (CRPR; Block 1965; Kochanska et al. 1989). The CRPR is a 91-item Q-set that participants used at age 18 to rate both their mother¡¯s and father¡¯s parenting style. Authoritative parenting was included as a covariate because it has been found to influence the development of LH strategies during adolescence (Dunkel et al. 2015). The last covariate was the level of intimacy the participants had with whom they reported having lost their virginity (knew each other a little, friend, going steady, or engaged). This covariate was included to test the possibility that the level of partner intimacy played a role in the effect of losing one¡¯s virginity.",1
1,17,"Descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations for the LH scores) by age, sex, and sexual debut are seen in Table 1. LH scores appeared to increase after age 14, which presumably reflects a normative developmental trajectory in the transition from adolescence to adulthood. In addition, males exhibit a faster LH strategy at all ages. These trends were confirmed in a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the within-subjects variable of LH strategy at ages (14, 18, and 23) and between subjects variable of participant sex. The within-subjects effect was significant, F(2,99)=9.16, p<0.001,¦Çp2=0.16,and so was the between-subjects effect for participant sex, F(1, 100)=5.52,p<.05,¦Çp2=.05.The interaction between variables was not significant and explained little variance, ¦Çp2=0.005.Correlations between sexual debut and LH strategy at the three focal ages were as follows: age 14 rpb(102)=-.06;age 18 rpb(100)=-0.24,p<0.05;and age 23 rpb(99)=-.14",1
1,18,"To test the hypothesis that sexual debut occurring in adolescence accelerates LH speed and that this effect is more pronounced in females, a series of partial correlations was conducted looking at the association between sexual debut and LH strategy at ages 18 and 23. Note that partial correlation is used to control for variance in both the criterion (e.g., LH strategy at age 18) and the predictor variable (e.g., sexual debut). Thus, partial correlation is more fitting for testing the hypotheses than an alternatives such as repeated measures ANOVA or regression (i.e., semi-partial correlation) in which the criterion (e.g., LH strategy at age 18) is not altered.",1
1,19,"Initially, and most importantly, the partial correlations controlled for LH speed at age 14. Then, in succession, additional partial correlations were calculated; in each case, an additional covariate was added. After LH at age 14, the covariates were added in this order SES, ethnicity, IQ, maternal authoritative parenting, paternal authoritative parenting, and the intimacy level with the partner. The results can be seen in Table 2. For the full sample when controlling just for LH strategy at age 14, sexual debut was correlated with LH strategy at age 18, but not at age 23. Additionally, the relationship between sexual debut and LH strategy at age 18 fluctuated as covariates were added.",1
1,20,"When the sample was split by sex, for females, the relationship between sexual debut and LH strategy at age 18 remained as covariates were added. There was an additional trend; the addition of covariates led to the strengthening of the relationship between sexual debut and LH strategy at age 23. To further explore this trend in females, two change scores were computed by subtracting LH strategy scores at age 14 from LH strategy scores at age 18 and by subtracting LH strategy scores at age 14 from LH strategy scores at age 23. Thus, positive scores indicate change in which LH speed slowed. Between ages 14 and 18, those who had their sexual debut during adolescence had a mean change score of (M= 4.80, SD=16.72), while those who did not have intercourse during adolescence had a mean change score of (M=13.45, SD=25.32). Between the ages of 14 and 23, those who had their sexual debut during adolescence had a mean change score of (M=7.48, SD=29.05), while those who did not have intercourse during adolescence had a mean change score of (M=13.20, SD=28.03). While the differences in the change scores are not statistically significant given the limited statistical power of between-subjects change score comparisons relative to the partial correlation analyses described above, the change scores do assist in interpreting the statistically significant correlations.",1
1,21,"Recent research findings and theoretical advancements have led to the prediction that plasticity in the development of LH strategies extends beyond the period of early childhood as first envisioned by Belsky et al. (1991). Following these changes in the understanding of LH strategies, it was hypothesized that the timing of sexual debut may impact developing LH strategy, such that sexual debut accelerates LH speed in adolescence. Additionally, it was expected that this effect may be more pronounced in females. To test these hypotheses, the relationship between sexual debut between ages 14 and 18 and LH strategy at ages 14, 18, and 23 was examined.",1
1,22,"The results suggest several possibilities. The partial correlations show that, for females, sexual debut may calibrate the developmental trajectory of LH strategy. After controlling for LH strategy in early adolescence and a number of potential confounds, female participants who engaged in sexual intercourse during adolescence had a faster LH speed in late adolescence and possibly into young adulthood. These individual differences are embedded in developmental change wherein raw LH scores increased with age. As such, the difference scores may provide a clue to help interpret these findings. Specifically, the observed age-related increase in LH scores was greater for those who did not engage in intercourse during adolescence.",1
1,23,"Given that a fast LH strategy is defined in part by an individual¡¯s degree of investment in mating effort, this pattern is consistent with the idea that sexual debut acts to upregulate women¡¯s engagement in risky tactics of intrasexual competition and/or mate attraction. This facultative response makes functional sense under our hypothesis, which posits that experiencing sexual intercourse would have been an ancestrally valid cue of having progressed into a LH stage during which the acquisition of reproductive benefits (whether via behavioral investment or genetic quality) would have become an adaptive problem of immediate and crucial importance. However, this hypothesis leaves unclear whether we should expect a longer-lasting developmental shift toward a fast LH speed that persists into adulthood. The fact that women¡¯s sexual debut experienced between 14 and 18 is not as strongly associated with LH acceleration by age 23 suggests that virginity loss initiates a shift toward investment in mating effort that is (potentially) temporary and subject to further recalibration as developmental events unfold. For example, some individuals who were temporarily calibrated toward a faster LH profile post-debut may later begin to invest heavily in future reproduction as they enter subsequent LH stages. Likewise, some women who remain abstinent between 14 and 18 may later become sexually active and consequently experience a temporary LH acceleration of their own. In either case, further life stage-linked shifts in LH after age 18 would be expected to attenuate the association of events in early adolescence with later outcomes.",1
1,24,"The main premise of the current study is that LH variation is regulated over ontogeny not only in response to early cues but also in relation to cues experienced later in development. With few exceptions (e.g., Vigil et al. 2005), ¡°biometric¡± indices have been viewed as outcome measures that signify individual differences in developing LH strategies (for an overview of biometric measures, see Copping et al. 2014; Figueredo et al. 2014; Figueredo et al. 2015). Although our correlational findings are subject to alternative explanations, they support the hypothesis that the experience of sexual debut may act to calibrate subsequent LH speed via promotion of investment in mating effort. At the very least, the data indicate that the trajectory of LH development in adolescence and the timing sexual debut are correlated phenotypic components.",1
1,25,"However, some specific limitations should be noted. While a number of covariates were included, genetic influence on both the timing of sexual debut and LH strategy (e.g., Eisenberg et al. 2007) cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, given that one of the controls was LH strategy at age 14, genetic explanations for the findings must move away from basic additive models, and additive effects appear to account for most of the heritability in psychological traits (e.g., Polderman et al. 2015). Another limitation of the finding is that the effect of sexual debut on LH strategy speed appears to dissipate as participants move from late adolescence into adulthood. Data points in later adulthood might shed light on whether this trend continued, but Q-sort data was last collected at the age 23 wave of data collection in the Block and Block (2006a) longitudinal study. As such, we hope that this article stimulates future research that can disambiguate the associations of biometric and psychosocial events with the development of LH strategy from adolescence into later adulthood",1
1,26,"This project was made possible by the Henry A. Murray Research Archive which is housed by the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard University. The data employed in this study derive from a 30-year longitudinal study begun with 128 3-year-old girls and boys, planned and conducted by Jack and Jeanne H. Block, involving a sequence of nine independent assessments based on personality and cognitive life, observational, test, and self-report (LOTS) measures.",1
2,1,"Contact switches and touch screens are the state of the art for recording pigeons¡¯ pecking behavior. Recording other behavior, however, requires a different sensor for each behavior, and some behaviors cannot easily be recorded. We present a flexible and inexpensive image-based approach to detecting and counting pigeon behaviors that is based on the Kinect sensor from Microsoft. Although the system is as easy to set up and use as the standard approaches, it is more flexible because it can record behaviors in addition to key pecking. In this article, we show how both the fast, fine motion of key pecking and the gross body activity of feeding can be measured. Five pigeons were trained to peck at a lighted contact switch, a pigeon key, to obtain food reward. The timing of the pecks and the food reward signals were recorded in a log file using standard equipment. The Kinect-based system, called BehaviorWatch, also measured the pecking and feeding behavior and generated a different log file. For key pecking, BehaviorWatch had an average sensitivity of 95 % and a precision of 91 %, which were very similar to the pecking measurements from the standard equipment. For detecting feeding activity, BehaviorWatch had a sensitivity of 95 % and a precision of 97 %. These results allow us to demonstrate that an advantage of the Kinect-based approach is that it can also be reliably used to measure activity other than key pecking.",1
2,2,"Recording pigeons¡¯ key pecking using a contact switch, a pigeon key, is common in studying animal learning and behavior. Such measurements only record whether or not a peck occurred at a specific time and at a general location. More recently, touch sensitive screens, which can provide a precise location of the peck, have become increasingly popular. Additional information could be collected if a video were used, including:",1
2,3,"1. the initiation time, speed of motion, head pose at start and end of pecks, pecks on the wall adjacent to key, and pecks initiated but not completed.2. the global body and head pose: head position and orientation, body position, and foot position. 3. the subject behaviors relative to the stimulus area, turning around, flapping wings, and so forth.",1
2,4,"In addition, the noncontact nature of the sensing reduces issues of mechanical wear and allows sensing at a wide variety of locations that do not have specific instrumentation, which provides flexibility for experimental design. Although touch screens may reduce the issue of mechanical wear, there is not enough experience to claim that other issues related to wear would not occur, such as visible damage to the screen. Additional issues with touch screens are the cost of the screen and that no commercially available software is specifically written for controlling learning experiments. Along with developing the programs using, for example, Visual Basic or MATLAB, investigators must integrate interface equipment for delivering reinforcers, providing feedback clicks for pecking etc. Finally, pigeon keys and touch screen can only detect pecks and various investigators have been interested in studying other naturally occurring behaviors, such as in a behavior systems approach (Silva & Timberlake, 2005), or reinforcing topographically different responses like treadle pressing (Wheatley & Engberg, 1978) or head bobbing (Ortega, Stoppa, G¨¹nt¨¹rk¨¹n, & Troje 2013).",1
2,5,"Although it might seem that a video would provide data for counting behavior, it is extremely difficult to automate the extraction of this information using a standard video camera. Figure 1 illustrates the problem. When an image of a scene is viewed, through lens optics, on the imaging chip of a video camera, the depth information of the objects in the scene is lost. The intensity of each pixel in the image is created by light arriving along a single ray (e.g., the ray from the top of the head of the pigeon in Fig. 1), and there is no easy way to determine at which distance along that line the object rests. One approach is to use a carefully calibrated camera (Zhang, 2000). Careful measurements are made of the position and pose of the camera (called the extrinsic parameters), the lens optics, and the spatial relationship of the lens to the imaging chip (the intrinsic parameters). The quality of calibration of the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters heavily influences any measurements made using the camera. Loose animal hair or ¡°pigeon dust¡± may affect these calibrations. Thus, calibrations may need to be repeated frequently.",1
2,6,"Nonetheless, some use has been made of automated video information extraction from a video camera: Pigeon behaviors, such as the ¡°head-bobbing¡± and ¡°foot-plant¡± components of courtship, have been monitored from motion capture data and automatic image recognition criteria identified using a conditional restricted Boltzmann machine by Zeiler, Taylor, Troje, and Hinton (2009). Image analysis has also been used to classify avian observations according to species (Song et al., 2008). However, it would be challenging to use image analysis to track the head and beak motions with sufficient accuracy and also be able to detect gross body motions within the full area of an experimental enclosure. Gomez-Martin, Partoune, Stephens, and Louis (2012) described a comprehensive computer vision package, Sensory Orientation Software (SOS), for automated measurements of animal posture and movement. However, they commented on the sensitivity to disturbances of camera pose during measurements. A more general and less expensive solution has recently been developed. The Kinect1 sensor (Freedman, Shpunt, Machline, & Arieli, 2008) is a combination of camera and distance sensor that generates both visual image and a depth image. The Kinect is a structured infrared (IR) distance sensor combined with a camera in such a way that the distance and visual images are registered¡ªthat is, that the pixel coordinate system relationship between the two images is known.",1
2,7,"A visual image can be represented by an intensity map I, where I(u, v) is the image intensity at row u and column v of the image. A depth image, obtained from the IR range sensor, can be represented by a map D, where D(u, v) is the depth (i.e., the distance along the ray in Fig. 1 to the closest object) of the object responsible for the intensity reading I(u, v). The Kinect depth image is 320 pixels wide by 240 pixels high, with a field of view of 57.8¡ã. A point cloud, a set of 3-D points, can be generated from D(u, v) by using the camera focal length to project u and v into x and y scene coordinates, with z = D(u, v). The Kinect is an inexpensive and general-purpose sensor currently available for the consumer video-gaming field (Suma, Lange, Rizzo, Krum, & Bolas, 2011). Because of its popularity in the consumer game market, there is software support for the sensor both from Microsoft2 and in the open-source community (OpenNI3 and OpenKinect4 ). The sensor is designed for use in indoor, unstructured settings and can easily be mounted to a large experimental enclosure. That software support includes software for generating and tracking human body features using a skeletal model: a 3-D stick-figure model that represents the locations of the subject¡¯s torso and limbs. Such skeletal models have been a topic of research for some time (Moeslund & Granum, 2001). Extracting skeletal models from point clouds generated by distance sensors such as the Kinect has been described by Sharf, Lewiner, Shamir, and Kobbelt (2007) and Suma et al. (2011), among others.",1
2,8,"In this article, we present a flexible method for using the Kinect for Windows sensor to extract 3-D body information, at video frame rates (i.e., at the same rate that images are taken in the video sequence), of a pigeon viewed within an experimental enclosure. The method is embodied in a program, BehaviorWatch. No special care need be taken, other than to approximately center the subject in the field of view and place the closest edge of the animal chamber no closer than 400 mm (300 mm, if the Kinect is equipped with a Nyko wide-angle lens; Draelos, 2012). The maximum distance to the farthest object should be less than 3.5 m. A simple skeletal model is used to represent key body locations. We go on to present an approach to estimate pecking behavior on the basis of the motion of these body measurements. Identifying ¡°treadle pressing¡± or ¡°head bobbing¡± could use a similar approach. Finally, we present a comparison of our approach with a standard contact-switch-based approach, with which we show that the approach produces measurements for key pecking that are very similar to the output of a standard contact-switch-based system. Additionally, we show that we can detect feeding behavior also, and that the timing of this detection matches very closely with time when the signal is sent to provide a food reward.",1
2,9,"It is well documented that mealtimes are anxiety provoking for patients with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) [1]. Eating and weight gain is associated with feelings of fear and anxiety amongst AN patients [2, 3]. Psychological and physical discomfort are often ex perienced after meals when patients can become preoccupied with thoughts of purging or feelings of guilt [4]. Support from staff or family during meal times is acknowledged as an important therapeutic activity for decreasing meal-related distress [5¨C8]. Supported mealtimes are typically facilitated by in patient staff but there is little research into effective interventions for reducing meal related anxiety in a ward setting",1
2,10,"Participation in music therapy can improve the quality of life, interpersonal relationships and social skills of people with mental illness [9¨C11]. Music therapy can help promote self-determination and collaboration with patients through focusing on strengths and resource-oriented practice [12]. Literature supports the relationship between music therapy practice in mental health recovery and emphasis on empower ment and patient led processes [12¨C14]. Use of music therapy to promote feelings of empowerment and equality are arguably expressly important in inpatient mental health settings that may otherwise provide little opportunity for self-determination [15, 16].",1
2,11,"Music therapy may offer motivation for recovery from eating disorders, distraction from negative thoughts and feelings, a sense of autonomy and creative ex pression [17¨C19]. Case studies derived from patient experiences have described feelings of renewed self confidence and empowerment through participation in music therapy [20]. In a qualitative study exploring the perceptions of group singing from eight people with eating disorders, participants reported several emotional and cognitive benefits including mental engagement and opportunity to distance themselves from life¡¯s problems [21]. Despite these reports of positive experiences during music therapy, there is no published research examining the role of music therapy during sup ported meal times. This study aimed to address this gap by evaluating post-meal music therapy amongst a group of inpatients with AN.",1
2,12,"The study was conducted in a specialist five bed inpatient eating disorders program situated within an acute psychiatric unit. The program primarily caters for adults with severe anorexia nervosa who have been unable to recover through outpatient treatment. The average age of patients admitted to the inpatient pro gram is 22 years of age, predominately young women. A collaborative conceptualisation-based approach [22] is adopted which is patient-centred and focuses on indivi dualised treatment. The therapy program includes a sup ported meal time (meal support therapy) that involves a period of post meal distress tolerance and support pro vided by a team member every lunchtime.",1
2,13,"The aim of this study was to evaluate post-meal music therapy amongst a group of inpatients with AN. The study aimed to both determine if participation in music therapy decreased subjective distress during post-meal support and to understand how participants described their experiences of music therapy during this time. The interest in both understanding and measuring post-meal music therapy suggested a mixed method approach, using different modes of self-reporting on the phe nomenon [23]. An embedded mixed methods design was adopted where quantitative and qualitative data were collected within a quasi-experimental design [23]. The qualitative part of the study is not included in this article due to the authors¡¯ desire to conduct a deeper ex ploration of the participants¡¯ rich descriptions of their experience. The quantitative element which is presented in this article, was a non-randomised pre-post design comparing music therapy with treatment as usual fol lowing mealtime. This was considered a fitting design because the intention of the study was to evaluate an existing music therapy program and therefore acted as a pilot study, in an attempt to give indicators of the size of the effect of the clinical intervention and to check the feasibility for a possible larger scale study.",1
2,14,Quantitative data was collected using the Subjective Units of Distress (SUDS) scale which was administered pre and post each intervention and control condition. Participants attended the music therapy intervention twice per week for the duration of their admission. At all other times during the week participants continued with their usual ward program. This project was ap proved by Human Research Ethics Committee at Austin Health (HREC/14/Austin/75).,1
2,15,"Adults admitted to the eating disorders program within the acute psychiatric unit, Mental Health Clinical Service Unit at Austin Health were invited to participate in the study. The primary researcher (Bibb) distributed the plain language statement and consent form to patients upon their admission to hospital. Informed consent to participate in the study was obtained from 18 of a total of 32 patients. During this time 89 intervention and 84 control sessions were recorded.",1
2,16,"Participants were trained in the use of the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) which is a self-report tool measuring the subjective intensity of distress or anxiety currently experienced by a participant [24]. Although originally used with a 0 to 100 rating scale, more recently scales of 0 to 10 have been adapted, with par ticipants rating their anxiety on a scale ranging from ¡®0¨C totally relaxed¡¯ to ¡®10¨C highest distress/anxiety/ fear/discomfort you have ever felt.¡¯ Avisualanaloguescale in the form of a ¡®feelings thermometer¡¯ aided in the visual representation of the SUDS ratings (see Fig. 1)",1
2,17,"Two one-hour music therapy group sessions were held directly after lunch each week. The group was facili tated by a university trained Registered Music Therapist (first author; RMT) in a meeting room on the psychiatric unit. During music therapy sessions participants were encouraged to participate in singing and listening to songs, talking about and sharing music with others and writing songs together. The goal for the group was focused on offering participants a distraction and opportunity to practice coping skills through music. A humanistic approach [26] was adopted where par ticipants were invited to collaborate together on the process of each session. The principles of humanism suggest that ¡°all persons have innate capabilities for actualising their own unique potentials for health and wellbeing¡± (p.148). Thus, the music therapist main tained a perspective of unconditional positive regard instead of a more directive approach common to cog nitive behavioural therapy groups in inpatient eating disorder programs. Group members were encouraged to listen to one another and engage in discussion about song lyrics and their preferred musical tastes. Other topics also emerged in discussions within the group which were often related to eating disorder recovery.",1
2,18,"Structured post meal support therapy acted as a control condition (treatment as usual) involving a one hour group session after mealtime and occurred on the remaining three days of the working week. These ses sions included discussion of feelings, encouragement to focus on achieving the goals of admission and group ac tivities such as playing games or art activities. Nursing and allied health staff facilitated post meal support therapy on a rotating roster.",1
2,19,The statistical software SPSS was used to analyse the data. Mean differences between pre and post scores and the standard deviation were calculated for both interven tion and control group data. An unpaired t-test was then performed to explore statistical differences between the mean differences between the music therapy and control interventions.,1
2,20,"A total of 18 patients participated in the study, including 17 females and one male. Participant¡¯s ages ranged be tween 20 and 58 years old. Length of admission ranged between 21 and 90 days. The 18 participants, attended 173 sessions in total for the music therapy (n=89) and the control conditions (n =84). Results can be seen in Table 1. The mean pre-test score for the intervention group was 8 and the mean post-test score was 5.6. The mean pre-test score for the control group was 8.1 and post-test was 7.1. Mean pre-post test difference for the intervention condition was 2.4 integers on the scale with a standard deviation of 1.9 integers. The mean pre-post test difference for the control condition was 0.93 inte gers on the scale with a standard deviation of 1.7 inte gers.",1
2,21,"An ANOVA score of f=28.5 and a highly statistically significant (p =< 0.0001) difference be tween the control and intervention conditions was found. The combined mean pre-test score for both con trol and intervention conditions was higher (8.1) than the mean post-test score for both conditions (6.3), meaning that across all 173 occasions participants rated their anxiety higher prior to participation in either con dition, than afterwards. Additionally, there was a statisti cally significant difference (p =< 0.0001) between the pre-test scores and post-test scores of all combined 173 occasions.",1
2,22,"The aim of this study was to compare the levels of dis tress and anxiety of patients with AN pre and post group music therapy provided after meals, with standard post meal support therapy. The results are strongly positive and offer support for the use of music therapy in AN inpatient care. Participants in both conditions reported decreased anxiety post-session compared with straight after lunch (pre-session). This supports previous re search suggesting that meal related distress and anxiety is a great concern for patients with AN [1]. Participants¡¯ levels of anxiety significantly decreased after both condi tions which also aligns with previous research that sug gests therapist facilitated support after meals is helpful for patients with AN [5¨C8].",1
2,23,"Results from the current study also suggest that group music therapy is a more effective intervention for reducing meal related anxiety than standard post meal support therapy in an inpatient setting. The average age of eating disorder patients admitted to the inpatient pro gram is 22 years of age. It is well known that music is an engaging activity for young people and is a motivating factor for participating in therapy [27]. It is likely that participants considered music therapy as a non threatening and familiar activity in an often confronting medical setting [15, 16]. Participation in music therapy may have acted as a ¡°cognitive divergence¡± (p. 111) for patients, allowing time for the body to digest food while the mind was attending to something else that was engaging for them [17].",1
2,24,"AN is associated with emotion avoidance and dys phoria [28]. Patients report that AN helps them to avoid and control their emotions [29, 30]. Participation in music therapy after meal times is a way for distressing emotions to be experienced through the music. Using music therapy as a distress tolerance technique empha sises the therapy that occurs during the music rather than through discussion [27]. In this instance, the ex perience of musical process is the therapy [31]. As such, there are broader implications for the use of music ther apy as an alternate coping technique for patients who are likely to avoid distressing emotions and often report feeling emotionally ¡®numb¡¯ [32].",1
2,25,"Participants¡¯ anxiety decreased significantly pre-post the music therapy group compared with standard post meal support therapy. This is important knowledge for inpatient eating disorder programs. Previously it was known that support after mealtime was helpful but the kind of interventions that were effective in reducing anxiety during this time were not [5]. Incorporating music therapy into inpatient meal support programs can offer patients with AN an alternative distress tolerance technique, which they can translate into their external environments post discharge [33]. Previous music ther apy research has focused on participants¡¯ experiences of music therapy sessions during their recovery from AN [17¨C19]. It is important to consider the heightened dis tress of patients with AN after meal times and the role music therapy can play in reducing anxiety during this time. The current study is the first to use music therapy post meal-time and offers support for further research into this area.",1
2,26,"The current study has positive implications for the use of music therapy in reducing meal related anxiety for patients with AN. However, the findings may be limited due to a number of factors. First, the research design was quasi-experimental and did not randomise participants to each condition. The same participants contributed to sev eral occasions (both intervention and control conditions) during their admission which meant randomisation was impossible. Second, participants were recruited from one site which may effect the generalisabiltiy of the results. Third, the same music therapist facilitated the inter vention group condition while a variety of therapists (allied health and nursing staff) facilitated the control group condition. The researchers attempted to reduce this potential bias by collecting a large number of occasions (173) over the 36 week period. A larger number of partici pants, randomisation to control and intervention condi tions and recruitment from different hospital sites would benefit future research in this area.",1
3,1,"The present study examined the relationship be tween attentional focus, perceived hole size, and radial putting error in a golf task. Twenty-five experienced golfers were asked to produce size estimates immediately after completing a putt. To assess their attentional focus, one of two secondary tasks (chosen randomly) was performed next. In the Hole task, participants were asked to indicate whether a sound played during their putting stroke was presented to the left or right of the hole. In the Club task, they were asked to indicate whether the sound occurred closer to the beginning or end of their back swing. Participants completed three phases: a no pressure pre test, a pressure phase, and a no pressure posttest. There were substantial individual differences in the effects of pressure on putting kinematics: 11 golfers (designated the Choke group) showed significant changes in kinematic variables and heart rate, and 14 golfers (designated the Clutch group) showed no significant change in these variables. For the Choke group, putting error and the accuracy on the Club task significantly increased during the pressure phase while size estimates and accuracy on the Hole task significantly decreased. There were no significant changes in any of these variables for the Clutch group. These findings provide further evidence for the atten tional accentuation hypothesis of action-specific effects.",1
3,2,"Recent research has demonstrated repeatedly that perfor mance of a skill that involves acting on a goal object (e.g., a ball to be hit) can influence ones perceptual judgments of that object. For example, Witt and Proffitt (2005) reported that softball players with a higher batting average in a recently completed set of games judge the balltobelargerthandoplayers with a lower average. Similar effects also have been reported for perceptual judgments of hole size in golf (Ca?al-Bruland et al. 2011;Wittetal.2008), upright size in field goal kicking in football (Witt and Dorsch 2009), target size in dart throwing (Ca?al-Bruland et al. 2010;Wespetal.2004), target size in archery (Lee et al. 2012), and estimates of runway size in avia tion (Gray et al. 2014). These Baction-specific effects are all examples of an individual¡¯s ability to interact with goal objects in the environment (as indexed by their performance success) changing the way in which these objects are perceptually judged. These findings are consistent with the theoretical viewpoint that perception directly specifies the relationship between the per ceiver and the environment rather than solely being based on the physical properties of objects (Gibson 1950; Proffitt 2006).",1
3,3,"Despite the growing body of research demonstrating action-specific effects on perception, the underlying mecha nisms havenot beenclearly identified. Alternative accounts to the embodied perception explanation described above have been put forward including ones based on experimental de mands (Durgin et al. 2009) and memory effects (Cooper et al. 2012). In the present study, we focus on an additional alterna tive explanation for action-specific effects: namely attentional accentuation. Ca?al-Bruland and van der Kamp (2009)have proposed that these action-specific effects are consistent with the perceptual accentuation hypothesis (Bruner 1957), which claims that when a person intends to act on object and directs their attention to it, the task-relevant object becomes accentu ated so that it stands out from other task-irrelevant objects (Balcetis and Dunning 2010). Evidence to support this hypoth esis comes from a recent study by Ca?al-Bruland et al. (2011) in which it was demonstrated that action-specific changes in the perceived size of a golf hole do not occur when a golfer is prevented from focusing their attention on the hole (because it was occluded) or when golfers are required to shift attention between an intermediate object and the target object (due to a requirement to hit a ball through a gate on its way to the hole).",1
3,4,"Further support for this hypothesis comes from research that has examined action-specific perception under conditions of high anxiety (Ca?al-Bruland et al. 2010). In this study, participants threw darts at a target and produced a judgment of target size. Under conditions of low anxiety (throwing while standing on the ground), there was a significant positive correlation between judged size and throwing performance, whereas under conditions of high anxiety (throwing while suspended above the ground), there was no correlation. The authors argued that the lack of effect in the high anxiety con dition was due to the fact that the performer¡¯s attention was drawn away from the target (and thus accentuation did not occur). A shift in attention of this type is consistent with both of the main theories of what is thought to occur to a performer under conditions of high anxiety/pressure: distraction theory and self-monitoring (reviewed in Beilock and Gray 2007).",1
3,5,"The goal of the present study was to further investigate the role of attention in action-specific perception by expanding on the anxi ety study conducted by Ca?al-Bruland et al. (2010). In this pre vious study, only perceived size and performance outcomes were measured. Thus, there was no direct evidence that the change in action-specific perception was due to a shift in the performer¡¯s attentional focus. However, previous research has demonstrated direct links between performance success, attentional focus, and movement kinematics under pressure conditions. For example, using a baseball batting task with college players, Gray (2004) found that a combination of competitive and evaluation pressure resulted in poorer batting performance, an increase in skill focused (internal) attention (i.e., batters performed better in a sec ondary task that involved judging the direction of bat movement), and a significant change in kinematics (specifically, an increased amount of variability in the timing of the different stages of their swing).",1
3,6,"Similarly, in golf putting an increase in skill-focused at tention (produced either by pressure or the introduction of a sec ondary task that involves making judgments about the movement of the putter) can produce both an increase in putting error and a change in putting kinematics (Beilock and Gray 2012;Gray, Allsop & Williams, 2013). In this case, the kinematic changes were an increase in club-ball impact velocity, a decrease in the time to peak speed, and a change in the relationship between downswing amplitude and putting distance. It is notable that all of these kinematic characteristics are typical of novice golfers (Delay, et al. 1997). See also Lohse et al. (2010) and Cooke et al. (2010) for similar findings. To our knowledge, no previous studies have examined how these changes in movement kinemat ics are related to the perceived size of the target object. Furthermore, although links between attentional focus and per ceived size have been inferred through looking at fixation patterns (Wood et al. 2013;Grayetal.2014), to our knowledge no previ ous studies have directly manipulated attentional focus and mea sured the effect on perceived size.",1
3,7,"In the present study, we sought to investigate the link be tween perceived size, performance outcomes, attentional focus, and movement kinematics in a golf putting task by measuring each of these variables and assessing how they change under pressure. Specifically, in conjunction with performing a putting task, participants were asked to estimate the size of the golf hole under nonpressure pre- and posttests and a pressure condition. The pressure condition involved a combination of competitive (monetary incentive) and evaluative (performance recorded and results distributed) pressure. The attentional probe method ology was used to assess the extent to which participants were focusing their attention on the hole or the movement of their club-head (Gray 2004; Gray and Allsop 2013). Finally, time to peak speed (TTPS)wasusedastheprimarykinematicmeasure, because it has been shown to be related to skill level in golf and be influenced by pressure (Beilock and Gray 2012).",1

Participants were instructed to Bstop the ball as close as possible to the centre of the target circle. All putts were made from a distance of 2.5 m.

The monitor was positioned perpendicular to the target circle at a distance equal to the putting distance (2.5 m). Auditory stimuli for the attentional probes were presented via two speakers (Logitech Model X140) placed at the end of the putting surface at a distance of 3.5 m from the participant.

Average heart rate was calculated for the different phases described below.",1
3,12,"The experiment was divided into four phases all completed within one 1.5-hour session: practice, pretest, pressure, and posttest. Participants were given 10-minute breaks between each phase. In all test phases, participants saw the final posi tion of the ball on the green.",1
3,13,"During this phase, participants took 20 putts under normal, single-task conditions. These trials allowed par ticipants to become comfortable with the sensor mounted on the back of the putter as well as to familiarize themselves with our putting task.

Following each putt, the ex perimenter measured the radial distance between the center of the target and the final position of the ball (in cm).",1
3,14,"Position tracker data from these practice trials was used to measure the timing of the putting stroke for each participant (Beilock and Gray 2012). This timing information was later used to control stimulus presentation for one of the secondary tasks as described below. For each putting stroke, we deter mined the instant in time when the putter began moving (STARTt) and the instant in time when the top of the back stroke was reached (BACKt). We then calculated the mean values of these variables for each participant.",1
3,15,"During this phase, the hole size estimation task was first explained to each participant and was practiced five times (without putting). The two secondary tasks were next explained to the participant and practiced five times each (without making the hole size judgment). Both secondary tasks involved the presentation of auditory cues, which were pure tones witha frequency of500Hzanddurationof150ms. The tones were presented via one of the two speakers placed on either side of the hole. Position tracker data taken from the practice trials was used to present the cue at a random time during the participant¡¯s backswing, i.e., interval between STARTt and BACKt. If the tone was not presented in this interval or occurred at the midpoint of the backswing, the data from that trial was discarded and the trial was re-run. The two secondary tasks were modelled after Beilock and Gray (2012) and were as follows:",1
3,16,"Hole task For this task, participants were required to make a twoalternative forced choice (2AFC) judgmentabout whether the tone presented was playedfromthe speaker tothe left or to the right or the hole. Responses were made verbally (by say ing Bleft or Bright) after the putt was complete (see below).",1
3,17,"Club task For this task, participants were required to make a 2AFC judgment about whether the tone occurred close to the start or the end or their backswing by saying Bstart or Bend after the putting stroke was complete. The tone was presented in the backswing, because our previous research has shown that this is the phase of the putting stroke that is most sensitive to attentional manipulations and golfers can perform this task with a relatively high degree of accuracy (Beilock and Gray 2012).",1
3,18,"After all of the practice trials were completed, participants completed 30 putts. For each putt, participants first completed the stroke and observed where the ball stopped. After each putt, they were then asked to perform the hole size estimation as described above. Finally, they were given a verbal prompt by the experimenter as to which secondary task response was required. The 30 putts were divided into 12 putts with a Hole Task prompt, 12 putts with a Club Task prompt, and 6 putts with a BNo Task prompt for which no secondary task re sponse was required. This ratio of prompt types was similar to that used in our previous study (Beilock and Gray 2012). The order of these prompts was chosen randomly (without replacement) on each trial for each participant. The speaker side on which the tone was presented also was chosen ran domly. Participants were not given any feedback about their hole estimation or the secondary task response.",1
3,19,"Note that we chose to have participants complete the sec ondary task after they made the hole size estimate to avoid the possibility that the former would influence the latter. The sec ondary task prompts were given after the putt was complete and 20 % of trials involved no secondary task judgment with the goal of measuring where the participant¡¯s attention was focused rather than directing it to a specific location via the secondary task. Because the participant did not know before or during the putt whether they would be asked to make the hole or club judgment, there was no advantage to shifting their attentional focus to one or the other location (Beilock and Gray 2012;Gray 2004; Gray and Allsop 2013). These two secondary tasks were chosen to allow for direct comparison with our previous research. How they might directly interact with the hole size estimation task is discussed in more detail below.",1
3,20,"Pressure phase This phase was identical to the pretest phase except that participants were given instructions prior to put ting designed to increase competitive and evaluation pressure. Before beginning putting, participants read the following script:",1

Prize money of ?50, ?25, and ?10 is up for grabs, for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place. How many points you manage to hold on to determines your position on the leader board.

3,27,"Despite the abundant evidence demonstrating that the action capability of a performer can influence the perceived size of the object(s) that they are acting on, to date there is no clear agreement as to which specific mechanism underlies these effects (see Firestone 2013 vs. Proffitt 2013). One key ques tion that has remained unanswered is what the role is of atten tion in these effects? Do objects look bigger to performers of higher skill level (or performers that have recently been suc cessful), because they are better able to maintain their focus of attention on the target object and this attention serves to ac centuate perception? As discussed above, although previous studies are consistent with the proposal that action-specific effects are mediated by attention (Ca?al-Bruland and van der Kamp2009;Ca?al-Brulandetal.2011;Gray2013;Grayetal. 2014), a direct link has yet to be established.",1
3,28,"The primary goal of the present study was to further investigate this issue by taking advantage of an effect that has been reported in several previous studies on skilled motor performance (reviewed in Beilock andGray2007),namelychokingunderpressure.That is, the introduction of performance pressure often leads to an inward shift in a performer¡¯s focus of attention. By assessing perceived hole size, performance outcome, and attentional focus in a golf putting task, we sought to es tablish a more direct link between these variables. A sec ondary goal of the present study was to investigate the relationship between movement kinematics and perceived target size. The vast majority of studies in this area have only looked at performance outcomes (Witt and Proffitt 2005; Ca?al-Bruland and van der Kamp 2009; Lee et al. 2012; Witt et al. 2008). It hence remained to be determined whether changestothewayinwhichaperformerisexecutinganaction are associated with changes in perceived size of the goal object.",1
3,29,"Consistent with previous research, the addition of pressure resulted in a significant change in the movement kinematics for some (but not all) golfers in the present study (Gray et al. 2013). Specifically, for 11 of25golfers, there was a significant decrease in TTPS (and increase in VI). A shorter TTPS typi cally occurs when a golfer has a very symmetrical putting stroke such that the maximum velocity occurs exactly at the point of ball-club contact: a technique commonly used by novice golfers (Delay et al. 1997). Expert golfers, on the other hand, typically use an asymmetrical putting stroke for which the club-head is still accelerating at the point of contact with the ball, and thus, TTPS (measured relative to start of the stroke) occurs a bit later (Delay et al. 1997).",1
3,30,"The advantage of using an asymmetric putting stroke with a longer TTPS is that the ball maintains contact with the club-head for a short period time after the moment of initial impact which results in the ball rolling more smoothly across the green (Pelz 2000). Therefore, the decrease in TTPS for the golfers in the Choke group in the present study is consistent with a regression to an earlier stage of skill acquisition as proposed by reinvestment theories of choking under pressure (Masters 1992). This idea is further supported by the finding (Fig. 2) that MRE was significantly higher in the pressure phase for the Choke group.",1
3,31,"Also consistent with previous research, this change in put ting kinematics in the pressure phase was associated with an inward shift of attentional focus, i.e., towards skill execution and away from the external environment (Baumeister 1984; Beilock and Gray 2012). As shown in Fig. 4, golfers in the Choke group had a significant decrease in accuracy for the external, secondary task that involved making a judgment relative to the hole location and a significant increase in the accuracy of the internal, skill-focused secondary task that in volved making a judgment about club movement. Together, these findings provide further support for explicit monitoring (and related) theories of choking under pressure in which it is proposed that pressure serves to cause inward shift in attention towards skill execution resulting a perceptual-motor control strategy typical of an earlier stage of skill acquisition (Baumeister 1984).",1
3,32,"There were some important design choices in the present study that could have influenced the pattern of results and should be examined further in future research. First, partici pants were allowed to see the final position of the ball after each putt. As proposed by Proffitt and Linkenauger (2013), this knowledge of results could have provided a scaling metric for the perceived hole size judgments (i.e., the size estimate was related to the variability of final ball locations). However, although there is some indirect evidence in support of this hypothesis (Ca?al-Bruland et al. 2012), in a more recent study we have shown that when performance variability was directly manipulated perceived target size remained stable independent of performance outcome variability (Foerster et al. 2015). Regardless, it will be important for future studies to examine whether the effects observed in the present study occur when performers are not given knowledge of results as has been done in previous studies (Wood et al. 2013).",1
3,33,"Another design-related issue concerns the timing of the secondary task. In the present study, the secondary taskstimuli used to assess attentional focus were presented during the putting stroke to allow for direct comparison with our previ ous research (Beilock and Gray 2012). Therefore, perfor mance on these tasks could not be used to assess directly the attentional focus before the initiation of the putt. It is possible that the judged size of the target was determined by the atten tional focus of the performer before movement initiation, which could have potentially been different than the focus during the stroke. However, we argue that this was likely not the case. First, previous research on golfer¡¯s eye movements (which can be used as an in direct measure of attentional focus) has shown that fixation patterns are similar before, during, and after the putting stroke (Vickers 1992). Second, we have shown previously by using an analogous secondary task in a baseball batting experiment that attentional shifts that are induced during the movement can spill over into the be havior that occurs before and after movement (Gray 2006).",1
3,34,"In conclusion, the present study helps to advance under standing of the mechanisms underlying action-specific effects on perception. We provide direct evidence linking the per ceived size of a target with extent to which an actor focuses their attention on that object¡ªa finding that supports the at tentional accentuation hypothesis. Finally, we show how the relationship between attentional focus and perceived size is accompanied by changes in putting kinematics.",1
4,1,"A basic assumption of Signal Detection Theory is that decisions are made on the basis of likelihood ratios. In a preceding paper, Glanzer, Hilford, and Maloney (Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 16, 431¨C455, 2009) showed that the likelihood ratio assumption implies that three regularities will occur in recognition memory: (1) the Mirror Effect, (2) the Variance Effect, (3) the normalized Receiver Operating Characteristic (z-ROC) Length Effect. The paper offered formal proofs and computational demonstrations that decisions based on likelihood ratios produce the three regularities. A survey of data based on group ROCs from 36 studies validated the likelihood ratio assumption by showing that its three implied regularities are ubiquitous. The study noted, however, that bias, another basic factor in Signal Detection Theory, can obscure the Mirror Effect. In this paper we examine how bias affects the regularities at the theoretical level. The theoretical analysis shows: (1) how bias obscures the Mirror Effect, not the other two regularities, and (2) four ways to counter that obscuring. We then report the results of five experiments that support the theoretical analysis. The analyses and the experimental results also demonstrate: (1) that the three regularities govern individual, as well as group, performance, (2) alternative explanations of the regularities are ruled out, and (3) that Signal Detection Theory, correctly applied, gives a simple and unified explanation of recognition memory data",1
4,2,"In a preceding paper, Glanzer et al. (2009) demonstrated that recognition memory performance is consistent with normative Signal Detection Theory (Green & Swets, 1966/1974)1 based on likelihood ratios (LR). The demonstration consisted of three steps:",1
4,3,"Formal proofs that the LR assumption implies three regularities. These regularities, defined shortly, are the Mirror Effect, the Variance Effect, and the normalized Receiver Operating Characteristic (z-ROC) Length Effect, (2) computed examples showing how LR decisions generate the regularities, and (3) a survey of recognition memory data establishing the ubiquity of the three regularities.",1
4,4,"The 2009 paper also briefly discussed two other topics: how bias can obscure the Mirror Effect and also how that obscuring can be countered. Those two topics are developed in detail here. We show that the Mirror Effect ¨C measured in the usual way ¨C is obscured by bias. We then counter the bias effect in four different ways. (1) by using a more informative index of the Mirror Effect, (2) by canceling the bias with a pay-off arrangement, (3) by using a between-list design, and (4) by increasing the difference in accuracy between the two experimental conditions (familiar vs. unfamiliar names).",1
4,5,"With respect to the survey in Glanzer et al. (2009), the following objection can be made. The surveyed data consisted of pooled group data. It is possible that group data give a different picture of the underlying processes than do individual data. The possible disagreement of group and individual data is discussed at length by Estes (1956) and Estes and Maddox (2005). The results reported here answer that objection by demonstrating that the three regularities govern individuals¡¯ performance.",1
4,6,"In a recognition memory experiment, participants are shown a study list of items and are later shown a test list consisting of items from the first list (¡°old¡±) and items which were not (¡°new¡±). They are then asked to judge whether each item is ¡°old¡± (O) or ¡°new¡± (N), a YES-NO task. Or they are asked to rate their confidence that each item is ¡°old¡± or ¡°new¡±",1
4,7,"There are many experiments in which individuals are presented with two different kinds of items (e.g., high vs. low frequency words) or two different study conditions (e.g., single vs. repeated presentation) that produce a difference in accuracy. These two-condition experiments are important because they show three regularities that are produced by LR decisions: (1) the Mirror Effect, (2) the Variance Effect, and (3) the z-ROC Length Effect",1
4,8,"When there are two sets of items or conditions in a recognition test that produce a difference in accuracy and the decisions are based on LR, then the superior condition (S) will give better recognition of old items as old and also better recognition of new items as new. In a yes/no recognition test the effect is seen in the mirror symmetric pattern of hits (H) and false alarms (FA):",1
4,9,"When there are two sets of items or conditions in a recognition test that produce a difference in accuracy, decisions based on LR will affect the relative variances of new distributions. SN, the new distribution of the superior condition, will have a larger variance than WN, the new distribution of the weaker, lower accuracy condition. This is a novel general effect, not previously noted in the literature. It is measured using the slope of the z-ROC that plots superior (S) new items ratings against weaker (W) new items ratings, the new/new z-ROC. If decisions are based on LR, the slope will be less than 1.0. Decisions based on LR also produce a parallel effect on the relative variances of the old distributions. SO, old distribution of the S condition, will have a larger variance than WO, the old distribution of the W condition. The effect is measured using the slope of the old/old z-ROC that plots the S old items ratings against the W old items ratings. Again, if decisions are based on LR , the slope will be less than 1.0.",1
4,10,"When decisions are made on the basis of LR, the length of the z-ROC contracts as a function of accuracy. The more accurate the condition, the shorter the z-ROC.",1
4,11,"From this point on we will use the log likelihood ratio, ¦«, for convenience. Its use allows us to present simpler equations. The log likelihood ratio ¦«=¦Ë(X) is a function of a random variable X and is therefore a random variable itself with its own distribution, mean, and variance. The distribution of ¦« is determined by the form of the distribution of X and the function ¦Ë().",1
4,12,We note that we used ordinary linear regression to estimate linear fits and obtain slopes for the computed examples of the following models. There is no issue with using linear regression in this way. The ROCs are plots of one theoretical distribution against another theoretical distribution. Neither axis is affected by random error,1
4,13,"We now present a simple example, a Normal Equal Variance Model that shows the regularities and how they are generated. In the example we assume a model of recognition memory based on normal equal variance distributions because the equations that govern the regularities are simple and the displays that show the regularities are also simple. We demonstrated in Glanzer et al. (2009) that the unequal variance normal model (which is a better fit to most recognition memory data) produces the same regularities as the equal variance case. The regularities seen in the example hold as well for models of recognition memory based on binomial and exponential distributions (see Glanzer et al., 2009). In this example we also convert LR to log LR, ¦«. The conversion does not change any of the effects discussed but allows us to present simpler equations and simpler plots.",1
4,14,"For the current example, SN and WN are both Normal (0, 1), WO is Normal (1,1) and SO is Normal (1.75,1) (the first number in the parentheses is the mean, the second number is the standard deviation). The model also assumes decisions being made on the basis of LR.",1
4,15,"Figures 2A and B describe the model at the theoretical level. Figures 2C and D represent observable data based on the model. Figure 2A represents the initial distributions of raw information for SN, WN, WO, and SO usually referred to as ¡°strength,¡± ¡°familiarity,¡± or ¡°amount of marking.¡± SO is placed to the right of WO, representing greater accuracy. SN and WN are not separated. It can be argued that new, unstudied items, because they have not been studied, cannot differ in strength.2 We do not separate the new distributions here; moreover, in order to show the effects of the LR transformation clearly ¨C namely, that when SO moves above WO, SN will move in the opposite direction, below WN, on the LR decision axis.",1
4,16,"When the individual decides on the basis of LR, the densities in Fig. 2A are effectively redistributed on a log likelihood axis, as in Fig. 2B. The log likelihoods, are random variables whose distributions are also normal (see Glanzer et al, 2009). Figures 2B, C, and D illustrate the three regularities.",1
4,17,"Figure 2B shows that when the densities of Fig. 2A are re-plotted on a log likelihood decision axis, the new distributions SN and WN which were at the same position in Fig. 2A are now separated. The Mirror Effect appears with the distributions ordered",1
4,18,"Glanzer et al. (2009), however, demonstrated that H/FA Mirror Index functions poorly when there are bias effects. In such cases the index may indicate the absence of a Mirror Effect even when the underlying distributions are actually in mirror order. We consider this H/FA Mirror Index at length in this paper, however, because it is widely used.",1
4,19,"In recognition memory experiments, bias can result if the observer misperceives the prior probability that the item presented on a given trial is old or, for some reason, believes that different outcomes are not equally rewarded or punished. The possibility of changes in bias by likelihood ratio observers in responding to different test conditions has been discussed by Wickens (2002): ¡°As a psychological model, the likelihoodratio procedure gives a simple description of how decisions are made. From past experience the observer has a feeling for the distribution of effects produced by stimuli from the two conditions¡­Bias can arise in this scheme in several ways.... Alternatives whose likelihoods are overestimated, perhaps because they are particularly salient, are more often chosen than those that are not.¡±",1
4,20,"The second term reflects the losses and gains associated with different correct and incorrect responses. If the penalty for a FA is increased, for example, the individual should increase his log likelihood criterion and be more hesitant to respond ¡°Yes.¡±",1
4,21,"We now report the results of five experiments that show the three LR regularities and the effects of bias. In the first experiment, normative word frequency is the strength variable. In the four that follow familiarity of names is the strength variable",1
4,22,"All five experiments¡¯ results show the three regularities. The second experiment, however, shows that bias can obscure the Mirror Effect when measured by the H/FA Index. The Distance Mirror Index, however, reveals the effect. The third,fourth, and fifth experiments demonstrate three other methods for countering those bias effects on the H/FA Index.",1
4,23,"We report experiment results in four stages. First, we report group, pooled results. All the individuals' confidence ratings are pooled to give a single ROC. These give a compact, general picture of the regularity results but do not permit standard statistical analyses. It will be seen, however, that the measures derived from the group results correspond closely to the measures obtained from the standard analyses that follow. Second, we give the H/FA Index of the Mirror Effect, the conventional analysis of the effect. Third, we report the three LR regularities based on ROCs computed for each individual. These give distributions of measures that can be subjected to statistical analysis. Fourth, we report a more detailed analysis of each individual's performance.",1
4,24,"To show the three LR regularities in a simple case without the complications of bias we review and reanalyze the data from a recognition experiment with normative word frequency as the variable: high frequency (H) versus low frequency (L) (Glanzer & Adams, 1990). Here L is the more accurate or strong (S) condition and H is the less accurate or weak (W) condition.",1
4,25,"The 16 undergraduate participants were first given a lexical decision task with 248 words, half H, half L, and 248 nonwords. They were then given an eight-level confidence rating recognition test with the 248 old words and 248 new (half H and half L). Further details on the procedure and method are given in the original publication.",1
4,26,"The four group z-ROCs, based on the pooled confidence ratings of all 16 participants, are shown in Fig. 4A and B. The regularities can be seen in the four z-ROCs as in the z-ROCs for the theoretical model discussed earlier (e.g., Fig. 2C and D). The examination is supplemented by sets of measures based on those z-ROCs. For the Mirror Effect, we measure the distances between the four underlying distributions. Those are obtained from the intercepts of the two z-ROCs in Fig. 4A and the two z-ROCs in Fig. 4B. For the Variance Effect, we measure the slopes of the old/old and new/new z-ROCs (see Fig. 4B). Here and in all subsequent analyses of group and individuals¡¯ z-ROCs those measures are obtained by fitting each z-ROC with a linear function using the Wickens maximum likelihood program (Wickens, 2002) which furnishes intercepts and slopes. For the z-ROC Length Effect we compute the Euclidean distance between the end points of the standard z-ROCs in Fig. 4A.",1
4,27,"We now report the results of the statistical analyses of the participants¡¯ responses in three stages. First, the conventional analysis of the H/FA Index of the Mirror Effect. Second, the analysis of the three LR regularities. Finally, a third analysis of individual responses with respect to the three LR regularities.",1
4,28,"The standard analysis of the Mirror Effect consists of a comparison of the accuracy of the two conditions (a difference is necessary for the effect to occur), and comparison of the hit and FA rate for each condition. The measures of interest are presented in Table 3. The table also includes measures of bias.",1
4,29,"We raised earlier the question of whether the regularities hold for individuals as well as for the pooled, group data. To answer that question we tabulated the presence of the regularities in each individual's data. The proportions of the 16 participants that show each of the three regularities are shown as ratios in the first row of Table 5. For example, all 16 participants showed SN < WN (dnn negative). All the regularities are evident and differ significantly from chance (.50) by a binomial test. These results fully support the analyses of the corresponding statistics in Table 4",1
4,30,"We next report four studies in which, instead of word frequency, familiarity of names is the variable. We switch to this variable primarily to document further the three regularities. The use of familiarity will, furthermore, permit us to evaluate an alternative explanation of the Mirror Effect, the twoprocess explanation, considered later. All four experiments evidence the three LR regularities. They show, moreover, how the bias effects that conceal the mirror effect as measured by the H/FA Index can be countered.",1
4,32,"Two main lists, one of F and one of U names, were used to construct the study and test list for each participant. The F list consisted of 120 names of well-known actors, actresses, athletes, and politicians. The U list consisted of names from a local telephone book. Examples of the F names were Drew Barrymore, Edward Koch, and Tom Hanks. Examples of the U names were Aaron Hutchings, Basil Madsen, and Dawn Wise. Preliminary testing was carried out with a group of 15 undergraduates who rated each of the names on a 6-point scale with 1 being ¡°very familiar¡± and 6 being ¡°very unfamiliar.¡± The F names had a mean rating of 1.14, ¦Ò = 0.15, with 98 % judged familiar. The U names had a mean rating of 4.83, ¦Ò = 1.01, with 21 % deemed familiar. An additional 18 U names were selected and used as practice and filler items. Twelve were used for a practice study and test list. Six were used as unscored filler items: two, at the beginning and two at the end of each study list, and two at the beginning of each test list. The filler names served to eliminate primacy and recency effects. List names were randomly selected and individually randomized for each participant.",1
4,33,"During study and test each name appeared in the center of the screen, in capital letters. During study each name appeared for 1250 ms, with a blank screen for 750 ms, separating successive items. The test list was presented immediately after the completion of the study list. The test list consisted of 120 F names and 120 U names, half of each studied and half new. The test was self-paced, each name remaining on the screen until the participant responded.",1
4,34,"Participants were instructed to decide, for each name, whether the item was ¡°old¡± (had appeared in the study list) or ¡°new¡± (had not) using a 6-point confidence rating scale. The confidence ratings were: (1) very sure old; (2) moderately sure old; (3) slightly sure old; (4) slightly sure new; (5) moderately sure new; and (6) very sure new. The numbers and their descriptions stayed on the monitor so that participants did not have to commit the scale to memory. The experiment began with a short practice session which consisted of a 6-item study list followed by a 12-item test list, six studied and six new items.",1
4,35,"The data for 38 undergraduates are reported (one individual¡¯s data whose responses were below chance are not). The participants had all been speaking English since the age of 10 years or earlier. They participated to fulfill a class requirement. This description also holds for the participants in Experiments 3, 4, and 5.",1
4,36,"The second row of Table 3 displays some of the results for the experiment. The first two entries show dF = 2.11 > dU = 1.04, t(37) = 77.69, MSE = 0.28. The significant difference in accuracy indicates that the Mirror Effect should be present. The next two entries are the bias indices. The mean bias index cU = +0.38 (a strong conservative bias) for the unfamiliar items and cF -0.03 (a slight liberal bias) for the familiar names. They differ significantly, F( 1, 37)= 20.93, MSE= 0.15 .The difference reflects the fact that participants tended to say ¡°yes¡± less often to the unfamiliar names, both new and old, than to the familiar names. This differential bias moves the two false alarm rates together. The pattern of hits and false alarms shows the effect of the differential bias, with FAFN and FAUN barely separate. The effect of the bias is severe on the H/FA Mirror Index. The statistical analysis of that index is the test of FAFN versus FAUN and HUO versus HFO. That statistical evaluation finds only HWO versus HSO significantly different, t(37) = 9.30, SE=0.03. The difference between FAFN versus FAUN, however, is not, t(37) = 0.45, SE = 0.03. If the H/FA Index was the only measure available, the conclusion would be that there was a failure of the Mirror Effect.",1
4,37,"The second row of Table 4, shows, however, that the Mirror Effect is present as shown by the significant dnn and doo Distance Index (entries 1 and 2). The mean distance between to two new distributions is negative, dnn = ?0.57, and with t(37) = ?4.41, SE = 0.13 is significantly below zero: FN < UN. The mean distance between two old distributions, doo = 1.28, is positive and with t(37) = 16.73, SE= 0.08 is significantly above zero: FO > UO. In sum, the Distance Index finds that the Mirror Effect holds. The distributions are in the order FN < UN < UO < FO. When there is differential bias, the H/FA Index, based on minimal distance information, fails to show the mirror pattern while the Distance Index reveals the pattern¡¯s presence.",1
4,38,The proportions of individual participants that show each of the three regularities are presented in the second row of Table 5. All the regularities are again evident and statistically significant by a binomial test. These data fully support the analyses of the corresponding statistics in Table 4. The denominators of the ratios vary because the data of two participants did not permit the computation of all four z-ROCs (they did not use a sufficient number of confidence categories). For the following experiments this variation in the Table 5 denominators occurs for the same reason: participants' responses that do not permit computation of particular z-ROCs.,1
4,39,"In summary, we have again demonstrated the presence of the three regularities in the performance of individuals, this time for familiarity of names as the variable. We have furthermore demonstrated that the conventional H/FA Index for the Mirror Effect is inadequate when there is differential bias. In that case, the more informative Distance Index based on dnn and doo should be used. We develop this point further by showing how to cope with differential bias when the H/FA Index is used.",1
4,40,"In the preceding experiment the participants showed a differential bias. They tended to say ¡°yes¡± less often to unfamiliar names than to familiar names. This bias concealed the Mirror Effect when measured by the H/FA Index. We now remove the differential bias directly by arranging differential payoffs for responses to the two classes of names. If our reasoning is correct then all three regularities should appear including a mirror pattern for the H/FA Index. We use the payoffs to induce a counter-bias canceling the observed bias. This experiment is particularly important because any apparent failure of the Mirror Effect is necessarily accompanied by differential bias. This accompaniment is seen in the data of Experiment 2 when the H/FA Index is used. Our interpretation of the relation between bias and Mirror Effect is that the bias conceals the effect, particularly with the H/FA Index. An alternative interpretation is that the differential bias is a by-product of the intrinsic failure of the Mirror Effect with the materials of Experiment 2.",1
4,41,"To test which interpretation is correct, we now repeat Experiment 2 but with a feedback operation,pay-offs, to remove the differential bias of Experiment 2. If our interpretation is correct, then the Mirror Effect should be evident, full-blown, even for the H/FA Index.",1
4,42,"The materials, procedure, and characteristics of participants were the same as in Experiment 2, except that, before the test, the participants were told that their responses would be scored with the following schedule: For each old, unfamiliar name correctly identified as ¡°old¡±, +50 points would be assigned. For each old, unfamiliar name incorrectly identified as ¡°new¡±, ?50 would be assigned. For all other correct responses, +10 and all other incorrect responses, ?10 would be assigned. Total scores were reported to the participants at the end of the test.",1
4,43,"The group z-ROCs are presented in Fig. 6. All three LR regularities can be seen. In Fig. 6A the z-ROC for F is above that for U with dF = 1.45 and dU = 0.77. The length of the F z-ROC, 1.60, is less than the length of U, 2.13: the zROC Length Effect. In Fig. 6B the old/old z-ROC lies above the main diagonal, with doo = 0.61: FO is above UO on the decision axis. The new/new z-ROC lies below the main diagonal, with dnn = -0.40: FN is below UN on the decision axis. Those two z-ROCs indicate the Mirror Effect. Also the slopes of both those z-ROCs are less than 1.0, slnn= 0.67 and sloo= 0.83: the Variance Effect.",1
4,45,"The first two entries are dF = 1.80 and dU = 0.91. These measures of sensitivity differ significantly, with F(1,33) = 109.06, MSE = 0.12. With a difference in accuracies across the two conditions, the regularities appear. The next two entries present the mean bias indices, cF = +0.04 and cU = +0.08. These indices do not differ, F(1, 41) = 0.58, MSE = 0.07. No disruption of the mirror regularity should be expected. The next four entries show the mirror pattern in the H/FA data: FAFN= 0.20 < FAUN= 0.30 < HUO = 0.64 < HFO = 0.78. Statistical evaluation of FAFN versus FAUN and HUO versus HFO find the values in each pair significantly different, t( 41) = 7.65, SE = 0.01, and t(41 ) = 9.29, SE = 0.01. The argument presented in the introduction to this experiment is supported. Differential bias in Experiment 2 caused the obscuring of the Mirror Effect as measured by the H/FA Index. Removal of that differential bias with a payoff schedule revealed the effect even when measured by the weaker H/FA index.",1

All the regularities are evident and statistically significant by a binomial test. These data fully support the analyses of the corresponding statistics in Table 4.,1
4,49,"All three preceding experiments displayed the three regularities. In Experiment 2, however, sizable bias difference effects removed the Mirror Effect according to the H/FA Index. In Experiment 3 we removed that bias with a payoff schedule and recovered the H/FA Mirror Effect. Another way to accomplish that removal and thereby recover the H/FA Mirror Effect is by moving to a between-list rather than a within-list paradigm. In a within-list paradigm, the two conditions, e.g., F and U, are both present in a single study and a single test list as in the preceding experiments. In a between-list paradigm, the two conditions appear in separate study-test sequences.",1
4,50,"The effect of separate test lists on bias was discovered by Hoshino (1991). In a series of experiments, he tried to replicate the word frequency Mirror Effect using Japanese kanji (ideograms) with a yes/no procedure and the H/FA Mirror Index. His first two experiments failed to show the effect, with P(HO) > P(LO). He ascribed the failure to a differential bias, a difference in the tendency to say ¡°old¡± more frequently to H versus L words. The c bias indices are significantly different. In a third experiment he tested two groups in different conditions. One was tested as in his Experiments 1 and 2, with a test list consisting of a mixture of L and H words.

For sloo = 0.44, t(34) = 13.75, SE = 0.04 are less than 1.0. The next two entries, mean length F = 1.97< mean length U = 3.81, show a significant length difference, F(1, 42) = 76.47, MSE = 0.76. The z-ROC Length Effect holds.",1
4,59,"Reducing the number of familiar names increased the accuracy of recognition for those items from d' = 2.11 in Experiment 2 to d' = 2.76 here. It thereby increased the difference in accuracy between the familiar and unfamiliar items. This had the expected effect of recovering the Mirror Effect according to the H/FA Index (see line 2 of Table 3.) It had the unexpected effect, however, of also increasing the bias difference by making the responses to the familiar names more liberal. This effect is of considerable interest. It indicated that an experimental operation may have a double effect: a change in accuracy and a change in bias. The reason for the bias change may be that familiar names generate relatively liberal responses initially (as in Experiment 2) because they are more salient for participants. When we reduced the number of familiar names in the present experiment, we increased their salience further and thus increased further the tendency for liberal responses (see Wickens, 2002, on the relation of salience to bias).",1
4,60,"Our contention is that SDT with its three basic concepts ¨C sensitivity, bias, and LR decision axis explains the three regularities. It also explains when the mirror regularity does not appear. There are process models of recognition memory that incorporate SDT and its LR component (McClelland & Chappell, 1998; Shiffrin & Steyvers, 1997). There is no conflict between such models and the more general SDT model considered here. What is involved are two different levels of theory (Marr, 1982).",1
4,61,"LR decisions need not be invoked to explain the data of a simple one-condition memory experiment such as the one represented in Fig. 1. The assumption that decisions are made on the basis of unprocessed ¡°strength¡± will do. When we move to two-condition experiments such as the one represented in Fig. 2 simple strengthbased decisions fail. This can be seen by taking the same parameters used there: SN and WN are Normal(¦Ì=0,¦Ò=1), WO is Normal(¦Ì=1,¦Ò=1) and SO is Normal(¦Ì=1.75,¦Ò=1). If we omit the LR conversion from the computations then none of the regularities appear. The initial new distributions do not move: doo = .75 but dnn = 0, no Mirror Effect. The slopeoo = slopenn = 1.0: no Variance Effect. And lenW = lenS = 5.66: no Length Effect.",1
4,62,"It is, of course, possible to hold on to strength decisions by adopting additional, ad hoc assumptions, to explain a regularity. To date, two such proposals have been made to explain the Mirror Effect: Criterion Shift and Two-Process. Their ad hoc assumptions are indicated below.",1
4,63,"There is ample evidence, however, that WN and SN do not stay fixed. Experiments on forced choice in which participants were required to choose WN versus SN items, called null choices, showed that the two new distributions are separated, SN < WN ( Glanzer et al., 1991, 1993; Hilford et al., 1997; Kim & Glanzer, 1995). In all five experiments reported here dnn is negative (see Table 3), indicating again that the two new distributions are separated, SN < WN with distance -dnn.",1
4,64,"A popular explanation of the Mirror Effect, is the two-process explanation, e.g., Balota, Burgess, Cortese, and Adams (2002). This explanation is limited to the word frequency Mirror Effect (seen in Experiment 1). It makes the following assumptions: (1) Individuals use a familiarity/ strength decision axis, unconverted; (2) process one: Low frequency new (LN) words start out situated lower on the familiarity/strength decision axis than high frequency new (HN) words because they are less familiar (ad hoc assumption). This gives one of the inequalities that define the Mirror Effect, LN < HN; (3) process two: Low frequency words are learned and recollected much more effectively than high frequency words, overcoming the initial position difference (ad hoc assumption). This gives the second inequality, HO < LO, of the Mirror Effect. The three assumptions in combination produce the Mirror Effect, LN < HN < HO < LO.",1
4,65,"To support the explanation, the Mirror Effect is first shown in a baseline condition. Then an operation is carried out, e.g., speeded presentation, that disrupts the Mirror Effect (using the H/FA Index). This is interpreted as a result of disruption of recollection. The two-process explanation is limited in two ways: (1) It explains only the word-frequency mirror effect, not, as will be shown, the name familiarity mirror effect (Experiments 2, 3, 4 and 5), and (2) it does not cover the other two regularities, the Variance Effect and the Length Effect",1
4,66,"The LR SDT interpretation of the mirror disruption as a result of speeding differs. L words require more processing time than H words (Glanzer & Adams, 1990; Wright, 1979). Speeding therefore has a differential effect on L versus H words. It decreases the accuracy for both L and H words but more so for L words. It therefore decreases the difference in accuracy, d¡¯, between the two conditions. In Glanzer et al. (2009) and in Experiment 5 we showed that the size of the accuracy difference between conditions was critical for the H/ FA Index of the mirror effect. If there is any differential bias, the smaller the d¡¯ difference, the less likely the H/FA Index (used in the two-factor mirror disruption studies) will show the mirror effect.",1
4,67,"SDT with its LR decision axis handles the data summoned to support the two-process explanation without postulating any additional processes such as familiarity and recollection. It is not, moreover restricted to the explanation of word frequency effects as is the two-process explanation",1
4,68,"Finally and more generally, Experiments 2, 3, 4, and 5 rule out a two-process explanation and, more generally, any explanation that assumes a strength/familiarity decision axis. Such explanations require that the unfamiliar new names (UN) should be lower than familiar new names (FN) on the decision axis, UN < FN. Therefore no mirror effect should occur. SDT with its LR decision axis predicts the reverse order, FN < UN, and a full Mirror Effect.",1
4,69,"Our finding that familiarity produces a Mirror Effect is supported by evidence from five other studies on recognition that have varied familiarity of words, names, faces, and tunes (B?ckman 1991; B?ckman & Herlitz, 1990; Bartlett, Halpern, & Dowling, 1995; Brown, Lewis, & Monk, 1977; Schulman, 1976). Those investigators use different names for the familiarity variable, e.g., prior knowledge, but it is clear that the two sets of items used in each study differ in initial familiarity.",1
4,70,"Rouder and his co-authors have raised questions about the legitimacy of statements about the relation of asymmetry of ROCs (slopes other than 1.0 of z-ROCs) to the variance of the underlying distributions. Rouder, Pratte, and Morey (2010) challenged results presented by Mickes, Wixted, and Wais (2007) in support of the relation between slopes and variance in the normal unequal variance SDT model. Rouder et al. presented z-ROCs from other models (e.g., log normal, inverse probit transforms of normal) with other variances that mimic the Mickes et al. findings. They concluded that ¡°there is no principled method for assessing the relative variability of latent mnemonic strength distributions¡± (p. 427). The argument has, however, been rebutted in detail by Wixted and Mickes (2010). The controversy cannot be resolved here. It requires, at a minimum, a demonstration by Rouder et al. that the alternative models proposed do as good a job as the standard SDT normal models with a range of data. Wixted and Mickes (2010) present analyses that they do not.",1
4,71,"Pratte, Rouder, and Morey (2010) are concerned with a different presumed problem in interpreting ROC asymmetries (z-ROC slopes less than 1.0). Their concern is whether they are an artifact of ¡°distortions due to averaging data over items¡± (p. 224). They conclude, however, that ¡°Application of a hierarchical unequal-variance signal detection model reveals that asymmetries are in fact a real phenomenon and do not reflect distortions from averaging data¡± (p. 224).",1
5,1,"Interest has flourished in studying both the spatial and temporal aspects of eye movement behavior. This has sparked the development of a large number of new methods to compare scanpaths. In the present work, we present a detailed overview of common scanpath comparison measures. Each of these measures was developed to solve a specific problem, but quantifies different aspects of scanpath behavior and requires different data-processing techniques. To understand these differences, we applied each scanpath comparison method to data from an encoding and recognition experiment and compared their ability to reveal scanpath similarities within and between individuals looking at natural scenes. Results are discussed in terms of the unique aspects of scanpath behavior that the different methods quantify. We conclude by making recommendations for choosing an appropriate scanpath comparison measure.",1
5,2,"We describe the scanpath comparison methods that have been introduced in the literature. In each case, we give a short description, and the reader is advised to consult the original publications for further details. Additional mathematical details are provided in the Appendix.",1
5,3,"One successful way for comparing scanpaths is based on the string-edit distance (Bunke, 1992; Levenshtein, 1966; Wagner & Fischer, 1974), which is used to measure the dissimilarity of character strings. In this method, a sequence of transformations (insertions, deletions, and substitutions), is used to transform one string into the other and their similarity is represented as the number of transformation steps between the two strings. This method has been adapted for comparing the similarity of scanpaths (Brandt & Stark, 1997; Foulsham & Kingstone, 2013; Foulsham & Underwood, 2008; Harding & Bloj, 2010; Underwood, Foulsham, & Humphrey, 2009). To achieve this, a grid is overlaid on an image, and each cell in the grid is assigned a unique character. Fixation sequences are then transformed into a sequence of characters by replacing the fixation with the character corresponding to the grid cell the fixation falls in. The dissimilarity of two scanpaths can then be represented by the number of transformations required to convert the string corresponding to the first scanpath to the string corresponding to the second scanpath.",1
5,4,"The string-edit measure has been used on a similar dataset previously in Foulsham and Underwood (2008), where similarity was found to be highest for scanpaths generated from the same person looking at the same image. In addition, in Foulsham et al. (2012), similarity in shape was highest for the same person looking at the same image. Given that the stringedit distance measure is most sensitive to similarities in shape and sequential information, we expect that string edit similarity scores should be quite high between scanpaths of the same person looking at the same image for a second time, convergent with these earlier results.",1
5,5,"Cristino et al. (2010) proposed a generalized scanpath comparison method that addresses many of the deficiencies of the string-edit distance method. Their generalization aligns eye movement sequences based on the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which is used in bioinformatics to compare DNA sequences. In their method, scanpaths are spatially and temporally binned and then recoded to create a sequence of letters that retains fixation location, duration, and sequence information. The two character sequences are compared by maximizing the similarity score computed from a substitution matrix, which in turn provides the score for all letter pair substitutions and a gap penalty. Critically, the substitution matrix can encode information about the relationship between specific regions of interest, thus providing the opportunity to include semantic information in the similarity measure.",1
5,6,"Since ScanMatch quantifies spatial, sequential, and duration information together, we expect ScanMatch to do well in revealing within-participant scanpath similarity, and in particular, the strong similarity between observers viewing the same image twice (see Foulsham et al., 2012).",1
5,7,"Shepherd et al. (2010) introduced several measures for assessing the similarity of two scanpaths. For each of the measures, the scanpaths are first resampled uniformly in time (at 60Hz), and truncated to the shorter length. These measures are sample-based, in that they do not require pre-processing of eye-tracking data into discrete fixation-saccade sequences via saccade and velocity thresholds.",1
5,8,"The overlap between two scanpaths yields a similarity measure that is sensitive to temporal and spatial differences between fixation locations. It does not take into account fixation duration, rather it uses the resampling to capture aspects of temporal similarity. Thus, this method preserves temporal ordering but does not account for differences in fixation times. As a result, two scanpaths could have the same spatial positions but different fixation durations, and this method would then evaluate them as not overlapping and therefore being very different. For example, if one scanpath lagged behind another by one fixation but was otherwise spatially overlapped, this method would evaluate the two sequences as very different. One drawback of this method is that it uses an arbitrary, pre-defined radius threshold, with similar disadvantages to the grid-based quantization of string-edit and ScanMatch.",1
5,9,"Fixation overlap is extremely sensitive to differences in absolute timing between two scanpaths, but is slightly less sensitive to differences in position (due to the use of the radius). Given these sensitivities, it is reasonable to expect this measure to perform similarly to the ScanMatch measure, which is also sensitive to the spatial and temporal similarities between two scanpaths.",1
5,10,"This measure is very sensitive to temporal and spatial differences between the two scanpaths. The sensitivity to temporal differences can be advantageous when timing is important, e.g., when the stimuli change over time, such as in videos. The correlation measure is also sensitive to small differences in fixation positions, given that there is no spatial quantization of the fixations. A significant advantage of this method is its use of the straightforward and readily interpretable correlation analysis. This measure is more sensitive to similarities in position than the fixation overlap method, while also taking sequential information into account. However, this strong spatial-temporal sensitivity may be less robust to noisy data than other measures that employ a grid or radius.",1
5,11,"Shepherd and colleagues¡¯ (2010) gaze-shift measure assesses how similar the saccade times and amplitudes are between two scanpaths. Gaze shift is computed as the correlation between the absolute values of the first derivative of each scanpath and is computed in the same manner as the temporal correlation, but using the first derivative instead of the position",1
5,12,"For smoothing and for computing the derivatives of the scanpaths, each scanpath is convolved with the derivative of a Gaussian filter. Gaze shift is sensitive to the amplitude of the saccade as well as to its temporal location. It reflects how similar two scanpaths are in terms of the sequence of large and small saccades. This captures some aspects of a global viewing strategy, as subjects who make small saccades within a localized region would have very different scanpaths than subjects who make large saccades within the entire visible area. This is also useful for comparing dynamic stimuli (e.g., video) to assess how subjects respond to temporal changes in the scene.",1
5,13,"The gaze-shift measure quantifies similarity in amplitudes, and might correspond well with the MultiMatch measure that quantifies similarity in scanpath length. In Foulsham et al. (2012), similarity in length was only consistent for the within/ between-image comparison. One might expect a similar result for the gaze-shift measure; however, prediction is difficult because it simultaneously quantifies, like the other samplebased measures, temporal similarity",1
5,14,"The most significant advantage of the linear distance method is that it does not need to be quantized as in the string-edit method. It simply compares each fixation in one scanpath with the fixations in another in terms of their spatial similarity. However, by comparing only nearest neighbor fixations in terms of distance, this method ignores sequential information. To address some of these issues, Mannan et al.¡¯s (1995) method was modified by Henderson, Brockmole, Castelhano, & Mack (2007) to enforce a one-to-one mapping between two scanpaths, provided that they have the same length. The results for the two methods are very similar (Foulsham & Underwood, 2008), which is likely due to the fact that Mannan et al. average the distances from the first to the second and from the second to the first scanpath, hence clusters of fixations in one scanpath are averaged out. For this reason, we used only Mannan et al.¡¯s (1995) original method in our analyses. Linear distance is a measure that specifically quantifies and compares the fixation positions in two scanpaths, regardless of the order of fixations. Given that scanpath position comparisons have previously revealed an advantage for within-participant similarity (Foulsham et al., 2012), we expect this method to perform well in comparing within- and between-participant scanpath similarity.",1
5,15,"Recently, Jarodzka, Holmqvist, and Nystr?m (2010), Dewhurst et al. (2012), and Foulsham et al. (2012) introduced the MultiMatch method for comparing scanpaths. The MultiMatch methods consists of five separate measures that capture the similarity between different characteristics of scanpaths, namely shape, direction, length, position, and duration. Computation of each MultiMatch measure begins with scanpath simplification, which involves combining iteratively successive fixations if they are within a given distance or within a given directional threshold of each other. This simplification process aids in reducing the complexity of the scanpaths while preserving their spatial and temporal structure",1
5,16,"Following this simplification, scanpaths are aligned based on their shape using a dynamic programming approach. The alignment is computed by optimizing the vector difference between the scanpaths (note, however, that scanpaths may be aligned on any number of dimensions in MultiMatch). This alignment reduces the comparison¡¯s sensitivity to small temporal or spatial temporal variations, and allows the algorithm to find the best possible match between the pair of scanpaths. All subsequent similarity measures are computed on these simplified, aligned scanpaths. The MultiMatch similarity computations presented here follow the implementation described in Dewhurst et al. (2012).",1
5,17,"Vector similarity is computed as the vector difference between aligned saccade pairs, normalized by the screen diagonal and averaged over scanpaths. This measure is sensitive to spatial differences in fixation positions without relying on pre-defined quantization. It is a measure of the overall similarity in shape between two fixation-saccade sequences.",1
5,18,"Length similarity is computed as the absolute difference in the amplitude of aligned saccade vectors, normalized by the screen diagonal and averaged over scanpaths. This measure is sensitive to saccade amplitude only, not to the direction, location, or the duration of the fixations.",1
5,19,"Direction similarity is computed as the angular difference between aligned saccades, normalized by ¦Ð and averaged over scanpaths. This measure is sensitive to saccade direction only, but not to amplitude or absolute fixation location.",1
5,20,"Position similarity is computed as the Euclidean distances between aligned fixations, normalized by the screen diagonal, and averaged over scanpaths. This measure is sensitive to both saccade amplitudes and directions.",1
5,21,"Duration similarity is computed as the absolute difference in fixation durations of aligned fixations, normalized by the maximum duration and averaged over scanpaths. This measure is insensitive to fixation position or saccade amplitude.",1
5,22,"The main advantage of the MultiMatch method is that it provides several measures to choose from for assessing scanpath similarity, and each measure on its own captures a unique component of scanpath similarity. Given the multiplicity of measures, it remains, however, difficult to assess which measure, or which set of measures, is most applicable in a given scenario. Furthermore, because each scanpath is initially simplified it is also not clear how robust each measure is to scanpath variations.",1
5,23,"Given that the MultiMatch measures have already been evaluated with a dataset similar to the one generated for the present work, we expect to essentially replicate those earlier results, where saccade direction, fixation position, fixation duration, and shape similarity were found to be higher for withinparticipant compared to between-participant comparisons.",1
5,24,"To characterize cross-recurrence patterns, we have developed several measures that are based on the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) for characterizing gaze patterns of a single observer (Anderson et al., 2013). These measures are introduced briefly below and described in detail in the Appendix.",1
5,25,"Consider two fixation sequences f and g that have the same lengths. For sequences of unequal length, the longer sequence is truncated. Within these sequences, any two fixations fi and gj are cross-recurrent if they match or are close together, i.e., if their distance is below a given threshold. In the following, we introduce several measures that we have found useful for characterizing cross-recurrent patterns.",1
5,26,"The cross-recurrence measure of two fixation sequences represents the percentage of cross-recurrent fixations, i.e., the percentage of fixations that match between the two fixation sequences. Cross-recurrence is higher the more spatially similar two fixation sequences are and quantifies their similarity in shape. It is invariant to differences in fixation sequence order as fixations are considered recurrent only if they overlap in position. Given that cross-recurrence quantifies similarity in position, results should be most in line with the linear distance measure and the MultiMatch position measure.",1
5,27,"The determinism measure represents the percentage of cross-recurrent points that form diagonal lines in a recurrence plot and represents the percentage of fixation trajectories common to both fixation sequences. That is, it quantifies the overlap of a specific sequence of fixations, preserving their sequential information (see Fig. 5). An advantage of this measure is that it provides unique information about the type of similarity between two scanpaths. Although two scanpaths may be quite dissimilar in their overall shape or fixation positions, this measure may show whether certain smaller sequences of those scanpaths may be shared.",1
5,28,"Laminarity is a measure of repeated fixations on a particular region that are common to both scanpaths. Laminarity is closely related to determinism. If both laminarity and determinism are high, then in both scanpaths fixations tend to cluster on one or a few particular locations and remain there across several fixations. If laminarity is high, but determinism is low, then it quantifies the number of locations that were fixated in detail in one of the fixation sequences, but only fixated briefly in the other fixation sequence. It is a measure of the clustering of fixations across two sequences.",1
5,29,"Finally, the center of recurrence mass (CORM) is defined as the distance of the center of gravity of recurrences from the main diagonal in a recurrence plot (see Dale et al., 2011b for another method to quantify leading and following in cross-recurrence). The CORM measure indicates the dominant lag of cross-recurrences. Small CORM values indicate that the same fixations in both fixation sequences tend to occur close in time, whereas large CORM values indicate that cross-recurrences tend to occur with either a large positive or negative lag. This is a measure of whether one scanpath may lead (positive lag) or follow (negative lag) its paired scanpath. Their overall similarity in shape or position may be different, but offset, such that one sequence proceeds in a particular trajectory, and the other follows the same trajectory only later on in time (e.g., a few fixations later). In the present work, we use the absolute value of CORM rather than averaging over positive and negative values as we do not have any specific predictions about whether leading or following is more likely to happen in one particular condition or another. Overall, we might predict low corm values for within-image, within-participant comparisons if participants consistently lead or follow a similar scanpath closely (i.e., with a low positive or negative lag) on a later viewing of the same image.",1
5,30,"In the present work, we compared the ability of the scanpath measures reviewed above to reveal scanpath similarities within and between individuals looking at natural scenes. In a paradigm adopted from Foulsham and Underwood (2008) and Foulsham et al. (2012), participants performed a scene encoding and subsequent recognition task. This ensured that participants saw each image in the encoding phase for a second time during recognition, allowing for a comparison of scanpath similarity both within and between subjects and within and between images. The main prediction of these comparisons is that scanpaths are more similar for the same person viewing the same image, than for different people viewing different images. This observation has been verified by a handful of scanpath comparison techniques (see Foulsham & Underwood, 2008; Foulsham et al., 2012). We use it here in order to evaluate the ability of each scanpath comparison method to reveal the uniquely high similarity in the scanpath of the same observer viewing the same image twice, and its ability to capture any singular similarities between observers and images.",1
5,31,Stimuli were presented full-screen on a 19-in monitor operating at a 60-Hz refresh rate. Participants sat 60 cm from the screen with their head restrained in a chin rest. Thus the screen subtended approximately 32.7¡ã ¡Á 25.7¡ã of visual angle. Eye movements were recorded using the Eyelink 1000 eyetracker (SR-Research) and participants used a standard keyboard when responses were required.,1
5,32,"A total of 36 images at a resolution of 1024 ¡Á 768 pixels were selected from a dataset created by Foulsham and Underwood (2008). The images were pictures of buildings, interiors, and landscapes (see Foulsham & Underwood, 2008 for more information). Half of these images were shown during both the encoding and recognition phases of the experiment, while the other half were shown only during the recognition phase to act as ¡°new¡± images",1
5,33,"For the sample-based methods, signals were re-sampled at 60 Hz. For the overlap method, two fixations were considered overlapping if their distance was less than 3.5¡ã visual angle. For the gaze-shift measure, a temporal Gaussian filter with ¦Ò = 100 ms was used. For the string-edit distance, fixations were discretized on an 8 ¡Á 6 grid (approximately 4? ¡Á 4¡ã per grid cell). For the ScanMatch measure, the substitution matrix was used to define similarity in distance between grid locations (as was done in the original manuscript). For the MultiMatch measure, scanpaths were simplified by combining fixations that were closer than 3.5¡ã visual angle or by combining successive saccades whose direction differed by less than 45¡ã. For the recurrence-based measures, two fixations were considered cross-recurrent if their distance was less than 1.9¡ã visual angle. For the determinism and laminarity measures, a minimum line length of 2 was used.",1
5,34,"Rather than simply compare measures in terms of their ability to detect the main effects and interaction of the analysis of variance, we chose to use effect sizes for making comparisons across measures. For example, if the recurrence measure has a high effect size for the main effect of image, then this measure is sensitive to this factor in the similarity of scanpaths. We used generalized eta squared (¦Ç2 G ) for the comparisons (Bakeman, 2005; Olejnik & Algina, 2003; J. T. Richardson, 2011). In repeated-measures designs, ¦Ç2 G is comparable across different within-participant and betweenparticipant variables (see J. T. Richardson, 2011, p. 142), but the same is not true for the partial eta squared (¦Ç2 p ). Thus ¦Ç2 G allows for a direct comparison of the effects of participant and image. Bakeman (2005) suggests that similar guidelines should be used for assessing the size of the effect with ¦Ç2 G as is the case for ¦Ç2 p , i.e., an effect size of 0.02 is considered as small, 0.13 as medium, and 0.26 as a large effect size.",1
5,35,"For each scanpath measure, the F-ratio and p-values for the main effect of participant, the main effect of image, and the participant-by-image interaction are presented in Table 2 and mean scanpath similarity for each measure across the four conditions is presented in Table 3. The remainder of the results will focus on the resulting ¦Ç2 G obtained for each term in the analysis of variance. The ¦Ç2 G values for the main effect of participant is shown in Fig. 1, for the main effect of image in Fig. 2, and for the participant-by-image interaction in Fig. 3. The means of the significant participant-by-image interactions are shown in Fig. 4, and the corresponding post-hoc comparisons are reported in the participant-by-image paragraph below.",1
5,36,"In the present work, we performed multiple types of scanpath comparisons on the scanpaths generated from a foundational encoding and recognition experiment. Specifically, we compared sample-based measures (Shepherd et al., 2010), gridbased measures (Bunke, 1992; Cristino et al., 2010; Levenshtein, 1966; Wagner & Fischer, 1974), the direct linear distance measure (Mannan et al., 1995), the measures computed from the MultiMatch algorithms (Dewhurst et al., 2012), and recurrence-based measures (D. C. Richardson & Dale, 2005). This design allowed for the comparison of scanpath similarity across images and participants, focusing on the relative contribution of the individual generating the scanpath and the influence of the stimulus itself on resulting similarities. In addition, this study was designed for the more general comparison of the methods used to compute scanpath similarity, which we compared by computing generalized eta squared. In the following, we review the contributions of each measure to the understanding of scanpath similarity in terms of participant and image similarities and then discuss the performance of each group of measures, with particular emphasis on the type of information they quantify",1
5,37,"Our results support previous work using a similar paradigm where the same person looking at the same image is more likely to have a more similar scanpath (Foulsham & Underwood, 2008; Foulsham et al., 2012). This was borne out in the number of measures that revealed a significant interaction between participant and image, where the withinimage, within-participant comparison had the highest similarity scores (see Fig. 4 and Foulsham et al., 2012, Fig. 2). Interestingly, because each scanpath comparison technique differs in the characteristics that it captures, the different scanpath comparison measures may be revealing in terms of the aspects of scanpath similarity that result from withinparticipant or within-image similarity.",1
5,38,"The quantification methods that were most notable in revealing within-participant idiosyncrasies were those that quantified similarity in shape and position: overlap, linear distance, ScanMatch and recurrence. Interestingly, and similar to previous work (Foulsham et al., 2012), measures that also quantified some aspect of sequential order such as ScanMatch and determinism were particularly discriminatory. Beyond the overall similarity in shape and sequential order, the determinism measure revealed that scanpaths are repeated by particular individuals on a more local level, where a person may have an idiosyncratic strategy of repeating particular short sequences of scanpaths in a consistent manner, regardless of the image they are viewing. Taken together, individual differences in scanning behavior reveal themselves in terms of overall scanpath shape and to some extent, the order in which this shape unfolds.",1
5,39,"The image had a very strong influence on the similarity of scanpaths. Most measures were able to detect a main effect of image and the resulting ¦Ç2 G values were quite high. Most notably, those measures that quantify shape, position and sequential order were again very discriminatory: overlap, linear distance, ScanMatch, recurrence, and determinism. Interestingly, most of the measures that performed well on the main effect of image were those with configurable grid or radius sizes. Although we used author-recommended or previously used radius/grid sizes, an interesting avenue of future research would be to examine to what extent the present results may vary with respect to the radius/grid size chosen.",1
5,40,"In the present work, we were concerned with how the measures compared when they were computed using author-recommended or previously-used parameters. However, the choice of radius size or granularity of grid is extremely important. As radius size increases, so does the chance that spatially sensitive scanpath measures are considered similar. As radius is reduced, the chances of an overlap are reduced. The Overlap method was an extremely successful scanpath comparer in this dataset, but uses a much larger radius compared to the recurrence-based measures, which also performed quite well. This could reflect the fact that the Overlap measure is reflecting some overlap in time that the recurrence-based measures are not, but it could also mean that the radius was simply bigger and therefore, overlaps in space were more likely to be found. It is our speculation that there may be a fine line between real scanpath similarity and spurious similarity due to radius size. One interesting avenue for future investigation would be to run scanpath comparisons on multiple radius and grid sizes and compare the results along with effect sizes. The general recommendation, based on previous work (Anderson et al., 2013; Dewhurst et al., 2012) is to choose a sensible radius size that reflects roughly the size of region of foveal or parafoveal vision. However, how the choice of radius and grid size impacts scanpath quantification and comparison is another fruitful avenue of future research.",1
5,41,"Second, it is important to keep in mind the various requirements of each method. For example, some methods, such as the recurrence-based measures, require that the scanpaths be trimmed to the shorter of the two scanpath lengths. This may result in a loss of some data. Certain methods, such as the sample-based methods and ScanMatch may require the data to be resampled. Thus, fixations and saccades are no longer relevant units. For example, the sample-based methods work directly on the sample-level data from the eye-tracker which are then re-sampled to 60 Hz. In comparing the resulting scanpaths, the specifics of fixations and saccades are lost. Some methods encourage the simplification of data, although this is not a requirement. For example, in our implementation of MultiMatch, angular differences between saccades smaller than 45¡ã were collapsed. Simplification is typically performed in order to increase processing speed. This may be desirable when many comparisons need to be computed (especially for the computation-intensive scanpath comparison measures), but is by no means absolutely necessary. Investigating the effect of simplification on subsequent scanpath comparisons is a fruitful avenue of future research.",1
5,43,"Although, as outlined above, the choice of scanpath measure is highly dependent on the research question, we have a few general recommendations. Scanpath comparison has evolved over many decades of research in eye movement behavior, but perhaps the most striking improvements have occurred most recently. ScanMatch is a remarkable improvement on more simple methods such as string-edit and linear distance and, as mentioned previously, is one of the few methods that naturally includes semantic information as part of the scanpath similarity score. MultiMatch is an excellent example of a method that is robust, easy to use, highly intuitive and freely available. Although cross-recurrence has only recently been developed for eye movements, we feel that it provides exciting opportunities to understand eye movement behavior beyond a single similarity score. The results from many of the cross-recurrence measures, such as determinism, for example, are simple percentages of fixations that overlap in a trial and are thus directly interpretable. These most recent contributions represent, in our opinion, the state-of-the-art in scanpath comparison techniques. However, these and many other scanpath comparison techniques are still under active development.",1
5,44,"One impressive aspect of the methods considered in the present work is that they are freely available, either upon request from the authors or directly online. Some measures are even accompanied by excellent user interfaces along with tutorials for their use (most notably, ScanMatch and MultiMatch), reducing the barrier to using these methods. Below is a list of URL¡¯s where, as of this writing, those methods that are available online can be found.",1
5,45,"In the present work, we compared some commonly available scanpath comparison measures by providing an overview of the each measure and then applying it to a single data set. We compared the measures based on the aspects of scanpaths that they quantify and on how well they performed in revealing differences in scanning behavior across participants and images. This analysis provides a framework with which other researchers can use to determine the most suitable comparison technique that is most appropriate for their application. We hope that this overview and these results will help those interested in studying both the spatial and sequential aspects of eye movement behavior navigate the myriad of scanpath comparison measures.",1
6,1,"This review provides a systematic analysis of studies that evaluated interventions for inappropriate sexual behavior(s) of children and adolescents with developmental disabilities. Searches of databases, reference lists, and journals yielded 12 studies that met the predetermined inclusion criteria. Each study was summarized in terms of (a) participant characteristics, (b) dependent variables, (c) research design, (d) measures and data collection procedures, (e) independent variables, (f) treatment integrity, (g) results, and (h) level of certainty. All of the 12 studies reported decreases in the target behavior as the result of intervention. The most common intervention involved the use of multi-component behavioral strategies. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.",1
6,2,"Sexual experimentation and exploration fits within the normal spectrum of human sexual behavior in prepubescent years. In particular, masturbation behavior has been observed to occur in utero (Meizner 1987) and during early childhood (Friedrich et al. 1998). According to Leung et al. (1993), masturbation occurs throughout the lifespan and most commonly occurs at 4 years of age and then again during adolescence. When defining normal or abnormal sexual behavior, the social, cultural, and familial contexts, the setting in which the behavior is occurring, and developmental norms need to be considered. When masturbation behavior is conducted in a private setting and is not excessive in nature, it is considered to be a normal part of child development. This behavior, however, may be considered to be inappropriate when it occurs for a sustained period of time and/or in public spaces and thus may warrant the need for intervention.",1
6,3,"Children with ASD in particular are reported to frequently engage in public masturbation (Ruble and Dalrymple 1993; Stokes and Kaur 2005), inappropriate touching of others (Clements and Zarowska 2000; Stokes and Kaur 2005), and fetishistic behavior (Ruble and Dalrymple 1993). There are several plausible explanations for this behavior. Firstly, sex education is not always provided to individuals with disabilities and is an area that is often ignored due to the potential embarrassment it may cause parents. Secondly, it is suggested that the predisposition of those with ASD, to engage in selfstimulatory behavior, may contribute towards repeated, inappropriate sexual behavior (Dalldorf 1983; Realmuto and Ruble 1999). Thirdly, unlike typically developing children, those with intellectual disabilities, particularly ASD, often require adapted and intensive instructional practices in order to acquire an understanding of the social and behavioral skills that might be learnt incidentally by others (Barnhill 2007; Gerhardt 2006; Hatton and Tector 2010). Due to the specific social deficits associated with ASD, these children and young people may have difficulty discriminating between public and private settings and may have impaired Btheory of mind (Baron-Cohen 2001). As a result, these children may have difficulty developing prosocial friendships and intimate relationships, may misunderstand relationship boundaries, may have difficulty understanding those behaviors that are appropriate in public versus private settings (Gougeon 2010; Hellemans et al. 2007), and may be excluded from social groups that provide typically developing children with peer feedback (Sullivan and Caterino 2008). Ludlow (1991) further suggests that the attention provided in response to the ISB of people with disabilities may provide strong social reinforcement for this behavior.",1
6,4,"There is little agreement in the literature regarding what can be considered ISB. For the purpose of this review, and based upon the literature on this subject, the term ISB is used to refer to those sexual behaviors that could be deemed to be excessive, obsessive, occur in public, violate others, are aggressive in nature, and/or imitate adult acts that are considered to be socially inappropriate.",1
6,5,"When individuals engage in ISB, there are profound implications for their social and familial relationships, as well as their community and home life. In clinical practice, parents of children with disabilities will often voice concern about their child¡¯s ISB and may seek advice in this regard (Mallants and Casteels 2008). To date, there is limited research that has investigated different approaches to the treatment of childhood masturbation and even fewer studies that have examined ISB among children with ASD or other types of developmental disabilities. As a result, there is little consensus among clinicians regarding best practice for treatment of ISB, and the services and supports that are provided in this area are often limited.",1
6,6,"Mallants and Casteels (2008) conducted a review of the literature which investigated assessment and treatment approaches for childhood masturbation among those with typical development. They developed recommended treatment guidelines as a product of this review. In these guidelines, it is suggested that the process should begin with an assessment that includes questions about the child¡¯s development, including affect, behavior, and sleep; questions about potential genitourinary or other medical problems; and consideration of cultural, familial, historical, relationship, and environmental variables. The signs of sexual abuse and/or skin irritation also need to be eliminated. In terms of treatment for childhood masturbation (CM), the authors highlight the fact that evidence-based treatment of early CM is lacking. When the assessment identifies that there are no additional confounding factors, it is recommended that treatment should focus on parent education and support. Educational processes should aim to alter parent perceptions of CM so that it is not viewed as pathology but, rather, a typical part of child development. It is further recommended that occurrences of CM should either be ignored or redirected and not punished due to the potential reinforcement that can come from responding to this behavior. Finally, the authors concluded that developmentally appropriate sex education should be provided to children in order to help them to understand what socially appropriate sexual behavior is and what it is not.",1
6,7,"In addition to the procedures recommended by Tarnai (2006), there is further evidence in the literature to suggest that treatment for ISB among those with disabilities should include a focus on providing sex education, as well as individualized instructional strategies. For example, Koller (2000) suggests that sex education for individuals with ASD should include instruction that is brief, repetitive, and specific; inappropriate behaviors should be promptly responded to and redirected; individuals should be taught an appropriate setting and time during which they can engage in sexual behavior; and private time should be proactively scheduled.",1
6,8,"In spite of the suggested value in providing sex education to children with disabilities, it is evident that we need to enhance our understanding of evidence-based practice in this area. Schaafsma et al. (2013) explored the development of sex education programs for people with intellectual disabilities and found that in general, these programs did not have clear outcome objectives, lacked theoretical underpinnings, had not been systematically evaluated, and the development of such programs did not involve consultation with relevant groups.",1
6,9,"It is essential to understand the lifecourse trajectory of ISB. In early childhood and prepubescence, the occurrence of these behaviors can have a significant impact on the development of friendships, familial relationships, social participation, and the individual¡¯s inclusion in regular education settings. If ISB persists or escalates into adulthood, this behavior can further impact on the formation of social relationships, intimate relationships, home living, and community integration. If appropriate treatments cannot be found, these children could be at at-risk of sexual abuse, particularly given the increased vulnerability and risk for sexual violence that children with disabilities can face (Jones et al. 2012; Koller 2000).",1
6,10,"A search of the electronic databases PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Centre (ERIC), Education Research Complete, and PubMed was conducted in March 2014 by both the first and second authors. The search terms Bmasturbation, Bsexual behavior, and Bgenital stimulation were individually combined with the terms Bautism, BASD, Bdisabilities, Bdevelopmental disabilities, and Bintellectual disabilities. Entering a combination of the terms Bautism and Bsexual behavior into PubMed yielded the greatest number of results, with 122 articles. The combination of search terms Bsexual behavior and Bintellectual disabilities and Bautism and Bsexual behavior into PsycINFO resulted in 115 and 98 articles, respectively. This was the second and third most productive combination of search terms. In addition to the database searches, ancestry searches were conducted using the reference list of each article that was found. Finally, a search of Google Scholar was conducted using the aforementioned search terms in order to identify any literature that may have been overlooked. No additional articles were found as the result of searching Google Scholar or ancestry searching. Each of the articles identified as a result of the collective searches were examined in order to determine whether they met criteria for inclusion in this review.",1
6,11,The literature search was updated in May 2015 by the fourth author. This did not result in any additional articles but did reveal two potentially relevant papers (Early et al. 2012; Mallika et al. 2013) that were later excluded as they did not meet inclusion criteria.,1
6,13,"Twelve articles met the above inclusion criteria. The remaining articles were excluded as they did not include people with developmental disabilities, did not investigate treatments for ISB, or included participants who were older than 18 years of age. The 12 studies retained were evaluated and summarized according to the following criteria: (a) participants, (b) research design, (c) dependent variables, (d) independent variables, (e) measures and data collection, (f) treatment integrity, (g) results (including measures of generalization and maintenance), and (h) level of certainty",1
6,14,"For the purpose of this review, generalization of outcomes is defined based on the occurrence or non-occurrence of the target behavior under non-teaching conditions or when these teaching conditions are varied. This is derived from Stokes and Baer¡¯s (1977) definition.",1
6,15,"The term treatment integrity is used to capture methods that were applied to ensure the intervention was implemented in the way in which it was intended. This includes recording inter-observer agreement (IOA) data, the provision of preintervention training for those implementing treatment, direct observation and recording of target behaviors, checklists to evaluate fidelity of implementation, and social validity checklists. Table 1 presents a summary of this information for each of the studies included in this review",1
6,16,Conclusive evidence describes those studies in which treatment outcomes are almost certainly true. Studies that provide conclusive evidence possess all of the methodological features of the studies that provide preponderant levels of evidence and also attempt to control for extraneous variables that may also account for treatment effects.,1
6,17,"In alignment with the procedure outlined in the Mulloy et al. (2010) review, the studies in this paper were coded according to whether the effects of treatment were positive, negative, or mixed. A positive effect was used to describe those within-subject design studies where all participants had positive treatment outcomes or there were statistically significant differences between groups in the group design studies. Mixed effects refer to those outcomes in which some participants demonstrated positive treatment effects, while other participants did not, and/or positive outcomes were identified for some but not all dependent variables. Negative effects describe those studies in which no treatment effects were noted for any of the participants in a within-group design, or the difference between groups was not statistically significant for those studies that employed a between groups design.",1
6,18,"In total, 18 articles were identified as possibly meeting criteria for inclusion in this review. In order to ensure the accuracy of the database search procedure, the first and second authors reviewed each of the 18 studies against inclusion and exclusion criteria. This resulted in 100 % agreement that 12 studies met review criteria. The remaining six articles were primarily excluded as they did not report on the treatment of inappropriate sexual behavior or they did not include individuals with developmental disabilities.",1
6,19,"Collectively, a total of 50 participants were included across the 12 studies. Butler and Fontenelle-III (1995) conducted a between groups study which included 30 participants. Coskun et al. (2009) conducted a single-case AB design study that included 10 participants. The remaining 10 studies included one participant each. The participants in the 12 studies consisted of three females and 47 males and ranged between 5 and 16 years of age.",1
6,20,"Twelve of the 50 participants included in this review had a diagnosis of ASD (Albertini et al. 2006; Coskun and Mukaddes 2008; Coskun et al. 2009), one child had moderate spastic hemiplegia, microcephaly, and severe mental retardation (Cook et al. 1978), one child had fixed encephalopathy and severe psychomotor retardation (Czyzewski et al. 1982), one child had a traumatic brain injury and seizure disorder (Fyffe et al. 2004), one child had Down syndrome (Polvinale and Lutzker 1980), and one child had a mild learning disability (Withers and Gaskell 1998). In the remaining studies, participants were simply described as having a level of intellectual disability, but further diagnostic information was not provided.",1
6,21,"The IQ of the participants was reported in five of the 12 studies (Albertini et al. 2006; Barmann and Murray 1981; Butler and Fontenelle-III 1995; Foxx et al. 1986; Polvinale and Lutzker 1980). IQ scores ranged from severe intellectual disability to being in the normal range for one of the participants with ASD. As so few studies reported the IQ of the participants, it is difficult to draw any conclusions regarding potential relationships between IQ, ISB, and response to treatment.",1
6,23,"Six of the 12 studies included in this review used a single-case experimental design (Barmann and Murray 1981; Cook et al. 1978; Czyzewski et al. 1982; Foxx et al. 1986; Fyffe et al. 2004; Polvinale and Lutzker 1980). Two of these studies included a multiple baseline across settings (Barmann and Murray 1981; Cook et al. 1978), one across time of day (Foxx et al. 1986), and one across settings and time of day (Polvinale and Lutzker 1980). Two of these studies used an ABAB reversal design (Czyzewski et al. 1982; Fyffe et al. 2004). The remaining studies used a simple AB design (Coskun et al. 2009; Luiselli et al. 1977; Withers and Gaskell 1998) or case report format (Albertini et al. 2006; Coskun and Mukaddes 2008). Only one of the studies employed a between groups design (Butler and FontenelleIII 1995).",1
6,24,"Two studies relied solely on the use of aversive procedures: one in the form of facial screening paired with negative feedback contingent upon the display of ISB (Barmann and Murray 1981), and the other aversive involved squirting lemon juice into the child¡¯s mouth contingent upon public masturbation (Cook et al. 1978). It is noteworthy that following intervention, the participant in the Barmann and Murray (1981) study participated in a sex education program designed to teach people with disabilities to appropriately express their sexuality.",1
6,25,"Three of the studies identified used a pharmacological approach for the treatment of inappropriate sexual behavior. This included the use of antidepressant medications, which can reportedly result in sexual dysfunction (Gregorian et al. 2002). The medication prescribed in these three studies was mirtazapine (Albertini et al. 2006; Coskun and Mukaddes 2008; Coskun et al. 2009). Mirtazapine is a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) that has been used effectively in the treatment of clinical depression among adults and the elderly (Croom et al. 2008). There is also a tentative suggestion that mirtazapine may reduce some of the symptoms of ASD and other pervasive developmental disorders (Posey et al. 2001). Coskun et al. (2009) selected the use of mirtazapine as it was reported to have potential antilibidal effects.",1
6,26,"Public masturbation was identified as a focus of treatment in nine of the 12 studies (Albertini et al. 2006; Barmann and Murray 1981; Butler and Fontenelle-III 1995; Cook et al. 1978; Coskun et al. 2009; Czyzewski et al. 1982; Foxx et al. 1986; Luiselli et al. 1977; Withers and Gaskell 1998). In one of these studies, this also included the public display of genitalia (Barmann and Murray 1981). In three of the identified studies, one of the target behaviors included the inappropriate and uninvited sexual touching of another person (Butler and Fontenelle-III 1995; Coskun et al. 2009; Fyffe et al. 2004). In the two studies that provided group intervention, several target behaviors were identified. For example, in the Butler and Fontenelle-III (1995) study, the 30 participants who were the focus of intervention engaged in what was referred to as frequent and recurrent sexual acting out behavior. These behaviors included uninvited and inappropriate sexual touching of another person, public self-stimulatory behavior, exhibitionist behavior, and the inappropriate and public use of sexual language. In the Coskun et al. (2009) study, the target behaviors included public masturbation, inappropriate touching of others, public disrobing, arousal resulting from specific body parts or inanimate objects, and observation of others disrobing or bathing.",1
6,29,"Polvinale and Lutzker (1980) focused on three categories of behavior which they labelled (1) assaultive behavior (nonsexual), (2) inappropriate interpersonal sexual behavior, and (3) genital self-stimulation. No further definition of these behaviors was provided.",1
6,30,"Several standardized norm-referenced measures were used for general changes in behavior in some of the studies reviewed. For example, Albertini et al. (2006) administered the Child Autism Rating Scale (CARS) (Schopler et al. 1980) and Schema of Appraisal of Emotional Development (Dosen 2005) during the first clinical evaluation and then 6 months following treatment. Coskun et al. (2009) administered the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) scale and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale at baseline and at the conclusion of their study in order to measure changes in ISB.",1
6,31,"Treatment integrity data was not reported in six of the 12 studies. Those that did not report treatment integrity data were Albertini et al. (2006), Butler and Fontenelle-III (1995), Coskun and Mukaddes (2008), Coskun et al. (2009), Czyzewski et al. (1982), and Withers and Gaskell (1998). Six of the studies collected IOA data over a proportion of phases (Barmann and Murray 1981; Cook et al. 1978; Foxx et al. 1986; Fyffe et al. 2004; Luiselli et al. 1977; Polvinale and Lutzker 1980). One of the studies reported on the procedures that were used to train those implementing intervention procedures (Barmann and Murray 1981), while another reported the data recording procedures (Czyzewski et al. 1982). Only Polvinale and Lutzker (1980) described social validity outcomes.",1
6,32,"Of the two studies which used aversive procedures in response to ISB (Barmann and Murray 1981; Cook et al. 1978), a decrease in ISB from baseline recordings was reported; thus, treatment effects were considered to be positive. In one of these studies (Cook et al. 1978), ISB ceased to occur following treatment, and in the Barmann and Murray (1981) study, a 98 % decrease in self-stimulatory behavior in the classroom, a 91 % decrease on the school bus, and a 92 % decrease in the home were reported.",1
6,34,"In the one study that used a group therapy approach (Butler and Fontenelle-III 1995), the effects of treatment were mixed. Data analysis revealed a significant reduction in sexual acting out behavior between pre- and post-test scores for the sexual intervention group. It was also evident that those in the sexual intervention group showed the most significant reduction in the target behavior when compared to the behavioral intervention and control groups. In the sole study that used an individual cognitive-behavioral intervention (Withers and Gaskell 1998), masturbation behavior decreased from 10¨C12 times per week prior to intervention to an absence of the behavior by the seventh and final treatment session.",1
6,35,"As 10 of the 12 studies included only one participant in their research design, few statistical analyses of findings were conducted. Butler and Fontenelle-III (1995) conducted an ANOVA to compare gains made between pre-test and posttest scores across treatment groups. Coskun et al. (2009) conducted Wilcoxon nonparametric t tests to measure the changes in CGI-S scores between baseline and post-treatment.",1
6,36,"Seven of the studies in this review included measures to assess the maintenance of treatment effects (Barmann and Murray 1981; Cook et al. 1978; Czyzewski et al. 1982; Foxx et al. 1986; Luiselli et al. 1977; Polvinale and Lutzker 1980; Withers and Gaskell 1998). This ranged from 2 weeks (Foxx et al. 1986) to 12 months post-treatment (Luiselli et al. 1977; Withers and Gaskell 1998). In each of these seven studies, the treatment effects were maintained following a period without intervention (Barmann and Murray 1981; Cook et al. 1978; Czyzewski et al. 1982; Foxx et al. 1986; Luiselli et al. 1977; Polvinale and Lutzker 1980; Withers and Gaskell 1998). Albertini et al. (2006), Coskun and Mukaddes (2008), Coskun et al. (2009), and Fyffe et al. (2004) did not report follow-up data.",1
6,37,"In summary, 11 of the studies reviewed demonstrated positive treatment effects. However, it is possible that some components of intervention when used in isolation (e.g., DRO) may not produce positive treatment outcomes (Polvinale and Lutzker 1980). The findings of these studies should also be interpreted in light of their procedural limitations.",1
6,38,"This systematic review identified 12 studies published between 1977 to 2009 that had examined the effectiveness of treatments for ISB in children and adolescents with developmental disabilities. The treatments for ISB included pharmacological and behavioral interventions, and each reported some positive treatment outcomes in the form of a decrease or elimination of ISB. Given the paucity of studies in this area and in conjunction with the limited number of participants in each study, the authors of this review are restricted in terms of the overall conclusions that are able to be drawn regarding potentially efficacious treatments for ISB.",1
6,39,"A number of limitations were identified in the research that warrants further discussion. Only one of the studies reached a conclusive level of certainty, with the majority of research studies identified as having a suggestive level of certainty. One of the primary reasons for this is due to the experimental design utilized in each of the studies. Several of the studies that were included in this review used a single-case AB research design (Coskun and Mukaddes 2008; Coskun et al. 2009; Luiselli et al. 1977; Withers and Gaskell 1998). This was the case for each of those studies that investigated the use of mirtazapine as a treatment for ISB (Albertini et al. 2006; Coskun and Mukaddes 2008; Coskun et al. 2009) and also the study that used cognitive-behavioral intervention (Withers and Gaskell 1998). While it is acknowledged that it can be unethical to implement a reversal design for behaviors of this nature, the use of an AB design in addition to other procedural limitations means that it is difficult to conclude that the positive treatment effects reported in these studies occurred as a result of intervention.",1
6,40,"In addition to the limitations associated with study design, the small number of participants that are included in each study threatens the external validity of the findings and makes it difficult to generalize the study outcomes across age, gender, disability, IQ, and sexual behaviors. While some of the research studies were strengthened by the use of a multiple baseline design, 10 of the 12 studies included only a single participant.",1
6,42,"It is noteworthy that many of those studies which provided behavioral treatment used time sample and frequency recordings in which IOA data were also gathered (Barmann and Murray 1981; Cook et al. 1978; Foxx et al. 1986; Fyffe et al. 2004; Luiselli et al. 1977; Polvinale and Lutzker 1980). As a result, these studies approached a preponderant or conclusive level of certainty and therefore showed promise as effective approaches to intervention for ISB.",1
6,43,"It is noted that in spite of an ideological shift in the way in which the sexual behavior of people with developmental disabilities is viewed, the approach to treatment of ISB between 1977 and 2009 remains relatively unchanged. The majority of treatment over this time period has been based on the principles of applied behavior analysis. The exception being three recent studies which have used medication as the treatment of choice (Albertini et al. 2006; Coskun and Mukaddes 2008; Coskun et al. 2009). The use of medication as a treatment for ISB needs to be considered carefully. Using medication without also teaching children and adolescents strategies to manage ISB may mean that medications are unable to be faded and therefore may not lead to sustained change in ISB.",1
6,44,"In addition to direct clinical implications, it is very important to consider the home and community impact of learning to refrain from ISB for children and adolescents with developmental disabilities. Given the way in which ISB can impact upon community access and engagement, social, familial, and intimate relationships, and school inclusion, it is essential to design and develop interventions for ISB for use across multiple settings or in which outcomes generalize across relevant settings. For example, intervention may focus on teaching functional alternatives to the ISB that can be applied in multiple contexts and across multiple people.",1
6,45,"As a final point, very few studies included female participants. Only three of the 50 participants collectively were female. It is recognized that there can be gender differences in the patterns of sexual behavior that are exhibited, though there is little research which describes the differences in the ways in which ISB is demonstrated in males and females. There are some suggestions, for typically developing children, that social and cultural factors and also anatomical differences may lead to referral biases in which males are referred more frequently for treatment than females (Mallants and Casteels 2008; Yang et al. 2005). The lack of research in this area makes it very difficult to draw conclusions about any gender differences in terms of the expression of sexual acting out behavior, the severity of ISB, and response to treatment. Furthermore, it raises the question of whether there are gender differences in terms of the rates and/or the manifestation or demonstration of ISB between males and females.",1
6,46,"In recent years, there has been an ideological shift away from viewing the sexual behavior of individuals with disabilities as pathological or deviant. In spite of this change in thinking, it remains that many individuals with disabilities have difficulty expressing their sexual behavior in an appropriate time, place, and manner. To date, there is a paucity of research that has investigated the efficacy of treatments for ISB in children and adolescents with developmental disabilities. It is essential that further methodologically sound research is conducted in order to enhance our understanding of evidence-based treatments for ISB. Providing effective treatment for this behavior has many important implications for social, developmental, community integration, and educational outcomes for this population.",1
7,2,"Understanding the value of testing and the use of testing as a learning device is critically important, especially with the growing use of high-stakes testing in education. What makes testing benefits particularly interesting is the differential impact of information learned during testing relative to information learned during an equivalent amount of time spent studying the material. For example, participants tend to remember information better if they complete a free recall test than if they simply study the material again (Karpicke & Roediger, 2008; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006a). While testing has robust and reliable benefits (see Delaney, Verkoeijen, & Spirgel, 2010; Karpicke, Lehman, & Aue, 2014; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006b, for reviews), there are also negative consequences of testing (see Malmberg, Lehman, Annis, Criss, & Shiffrin, 2014). For instance, retrieving a subset of studied items associated with a particular cue (e.g., category membership) during test can impair retrieval of other items from the same set (Malmberg, Criss, Gangwani, & Shiffrin, 2012; Roediger, 1973; Slamecka, 1968). A substantial negative consequence of testing is the finding that performance decreases over the course of a test list (Criss, Malmberg, & Shiffrin, 2011; Murdock & Anderson, 1975; Ratcliff & Hockley, 1980; Roediger, 1974; Roediger & Schmidt, 1980). This finding, termed Boutput interference (OI), has been modeled as the result of encoding during test by either updating existing memories with information gained during the test or adding new traces to episodic memory. Consequently, items that are tested toward the end of a test list suffer from additional interference generated by the information added to memory during the course of testing (Criss et al., 2011).",1
7,4,"The Annis et al. (2013) data demonstrate that retrieving from semantic traces does not add to the OI measured for an episodic task alone. However, it says nothing about OI occurring within a semantic task. Although the semantic and episodic memory systems dissociate in a variety of functional, pharmacological, and structural ways, the systems are heavily dependent on one another (Greenberg & Verfaellie, 2010; Nyberg & Tulving, 1996; Tulving, 1972). Semantic information contributes to the retrieval of episodic information (e.g., Howard & Kahana, 2002; Prince, Tsukiura, & Cabeza, 2007) and episodic experience primes performance on semantic tasks (Schooler, Shiffrin, & Raaijmakers, 2001; Jacoby & Dallas, 1981; Ratcliff & McKoon, 1997; Reder, Park, & Kieffaber, 2009). Moreover, semantic knowledge is necessarily episodic at one point (i.e., when the fact was initially learned; A. B. Nelson & Shiffrin, 2013; Mueller & Shiffrin, 2006; Schooler et al., 2001); however, through repeated exposure the information becomes more complete and decontextualized. The result is a more durable, semantic memory resistant to episodic interference (Tulving, 1972).",1
7,5,"The stimuli used for the experiment were 300 general knowledge questions developed by T. O. Nelson and Narens (1980) and revised by Tauber, Dunlosky, Rawson, Rhodes, and Sitzman (2013). The materials were adapted for use in a four-alternative forced choice recognition (4AFC) procedure by generating plausible foil items for each target response. Foil items were chosen based on semantic proximity to the target response as measured by latent semantic analysis (LSA; Landauer, Foltz, & Laham, 1998).1 Reasonable responses that were similar parts of speech, were not synonyms, were not another form of the response, and did not appear elsewhere in the stimulus set were selected. In instances where one or more foil responses were unable to be retrieved from LSA we used a simple internet search of the question and selected a response from amongst the top results according to the same constraints. The experiment was administered using MATLAB (R2011a) and Psychtoolbox v3.0 (Brainard, 1997).",1
7,6,"Test performance was analyzed using a Bayesian multiple linear regression developed by Kruschke (2011) and cross-validated with a frequentist regression. Interpretation of the Bayesian model parameters is identical to that of a typical regression from the frequentist tradition. We chose this approach because it allows us to quantify the amount of evidence in favor or against a null effect (e.g., Rouder, Speckman, Dongchu, Morey, & Iverson, 2009). The focus of our analysis was the change in performance acrosstest trials, specifically whetherthere is a nonzero slope for the performance change. Moreover, we examined whether the slope of performance across trials changed from Test 1 to Test 2.",1
7,7,"For each participant, the 150 test trials were binned into 10 blocks of 15 trials each. Entered into the regression model were standardized block-level performance data, block number (1:10), dummy-coded test number (Test 1 = 0, Test 2 = 1), and the interaction of block number and test number.",1
7,9,"The Savage-Dickey estimation of the Bayes Factor (B01) is the ratio of the likelihood of observing a zero slope in the posterior distribution relative to observing a zero slope in the prior distribution. A BF of less than 1 indicates that observing a slope of zero is more likely in the prior distribution and provides greater evidence in favor of the null hypothesis that OI is not present and that slope of the observed data is zero (i.e., ¦Â = 0). A BF greater than 1 indicates evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis (i.e., ¦Â1 ¡Ù 0), that the slope of the observed data is credibly nonzero (i.e., ¦Â ¡Ù 0). The analyses were completed in R (v2.15; R Core Team, 2013) using the JAGS software (v3.1.0) and Brjags package (Plummer, 2013) for R",1
7,10,"The descriptive data and Bayesian modeling results for Test 1 and Test 2 are presented in Fig. 2. Visually, the data suggest that performance on Test 1 does not change across successive trials, whereas performance on Test 2 decreases across trial. The profile plotin Fig. 2a depicts performance for a giventest block (containing 15 test trials each) of Test 1. Indeed, the interaction term, representing the difference in slope of the Test 1 and 2 data, was negative indicating a bigger value for Test 2 (¦Â = -.007, 95 % HDI: -.013, -.0004) and did not include zero as a credible value (BF01 = .341). Therefore, there is very strong evidence that the Test 2 performance declines over the test block and Test 1 does not change, with modest support for a difference between the slopes of Test 1 and Test 2.",1
7,11,"One possible explanation for the OI observed in Test 2 is that performance is a combination of searches of knowledge and recent memory, with the latter being more influenced by OI. To explore this possibility, we evaluated Test 2 performance conditionalized on the accuracy of the Test 1 response. If the Test 1 response was correct, then it is possible that the participant found the answer by a searching knowledge or, in rare cases, by correctly guessing. Under these conditions, OI may not be observed. If the Test 1 response was incorrect, participants may generate a correct Test 2 response on occasion by correctly guessing or by engaging a successful search of semantic memory that failed during Test 1. However, it seems reasonable that participants may also be relying on episodic memory for the Test 1 feedback to generate a correct Test 2 response, particularly given much higher accuracy for Test 2 than Test 1. Under these circumstances, OI should be observed.",1
7,12,"As can be seen in Fig. 3a, when participants answered a question correctly during Test 1, performance on Test 2 did not decline across test position. However, when the question was incorrect on Test 1, performance on Test 2 decreased substantially across test position (see Fig. 3b). These patterns are substantiated by the Bayesian analysis. Indeed, the interaction term, representing the difference in slope of Test 2 when the Test 1 response was correct or incorrect, was credibly positive indicating a steeper slope for the latter (¦Â = .016, 95 % HDI: .0006, .031) and did not include zero as a credible value (BF01 = .148). Examining the simple slopes, the slope for Test 2 given the Test 1 response was correct was relatively flat (¦Â = -.006, 95 % HDI: -.016, .005), and has an HDI that encompasses zero as a credible value. However, the evidence in favor of a zero value is ambiguous because it is nearly equal to evidence in favor of a nonzero slope (BF01 = 1.04). Thus, we can neither reject nor accept the null hypothesis in this instance.",1
7,13,"The Bayesian results were again substantiated by a frequentist multiple regression on the data aggregated across participant by Test Block and Test 1 accuracy indicating that Test Block and Test 1 accuracy explained a significant amount of variance in performance, F(3, 8) = 96.41, p < .001, R2 = .973, R2 Adjusted = .963). Moreover, the interaction of Test Bin and Previous Response was significant, ¦Â = .016, t(8) = 3.83, p = .005. The slope of the change in performance across Test Block for Test 2 was shallower when the Test 1 response was correct (¦Â = -.006) relative to when the Test 1 response was incorrect (¦Â = -.022)",1
7,14,"In the current data, we observed that the pattern of output interference (OI) changed depending on whether it was the first or second time the set of questions had been answered. Specifically, no OI was observed during the initial test, but a robust OI effect was observed during the second test ¨C after participants had received corrective feedback. Moreover, this OI was largely restricted to those questions for which the Test 1 response was incorrect. During the initial test, in the absence of recent episodic experience with the factual information, it is reasonable to presume that participants are searching knowledge (i.e., semantic memory), yet we observed no OI for Test 1. Participants could have recent experience with some of the information and, as a result, search episodic memory during Test 1, but such an occurrence would likely not be systematic. Critically, no OI was observed for Test 1. During the second test, it is reasonable to presume that participants are likely answering questions using a combination of knowledge and recent experience. For questions that were answered correctly during Test 1, participants could rely on knowledge as they presumably did during Test 1, to retrieve the correct answer. Of course, they could also search episodic memory. For questions that were answered incorrectly on Test 1, participants could rely on the episodic memory of the corrective feedback from Test 1 in order to answer Test 2. Of course they could also search knowledge, thought this is unlikely to lead to a correct answer given that it failed during Test 1. Importantly, Test 2 demonstrated a robust OI effect that was largely isolated to questions answered incorrectly during Test 1. We suggest that this indicates that OI is most pronounced for episodic memory.",1
7,15,"We therefore suggest that the best explanation of the data is the differential reliance on episodic and semantic memory to correctly answer questions. Episodic memory may be more susceptible to the sort of interference generated during testing (e.g., gradual changes in context, encoding/updating of items), whereas semantic memory is less so. Interestingly, attempting to reinstate encoding context, as suggested by many textbooks based on classic memory research (e.g., S. M. Smith, 1979) as a useful strategy for test taking, may be detrimental for tests intended to measure knowledge. That is, focusing on episodic retrieval using context information allows for interference from other information that matches the same context.",1
7,16,"In summary, we found that successive searches of knowledge do not suffer from OI using a set of general knowledge questions. However, OI was robust when participants presumably completed the test of knowledge by relying on episodic information, namely corrective feedback, provided during Test 1. These data provide potential constraints on the relationship between episodic and semantic memory",1
8,1,"The publication of this issue of Psychological Studies coincides with two important occasions that indicate the progress and development of psychology both as a field of study and research endeavor. First, Calcutta University is celebrating the centenary of Psychology Department which came into existence in the year 1915. Second, this journal is completing 60 years of its publication. These two events showcase the expansion and advancement of psychology in India in the last one century. Further, I am completing 15 years as Editor of this journal of the National Academy of Psychology (NAOP) India. Editing this journal has been a challenging and enriching experience for me. Significantly this task demands a consistent, sustained and collaborative effort. I could accomplish this responsibility with the timely help and support from the community of scholars. On account of personal reasons I found it extremely difficult to continue as Editor and the executive body of the NAOP kindly agreed to my request. I take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to the NAOP officials and NAOP community for the conviction and trust shown during my tenure. The reviewers , associate editors and consulting editors of the journal have extended full support in editorial process. The administrative and production teams at Springer always helped in organizing the publication process.",1
8,2,"The last few decades have witnessed tremendous expansion of the discipline of psychology in many directions. It has happened in the domains of theory, research and practice. While psychometric, clinical and organizational subfields have continued to receive research attention a small but strong segment of researchers is showing change in their research agenda and increasingly engaging with indigenous concepts and methods. The choice of research issues and problems is showing greater degree of cultural sensibility",1
8,4,"In addition to regular articles the present issue of Psychological Studies includes a stimulating target article by Adrian Brock on Diversity and Presentism in the History of Psychology. It is followed by commentaries by several scholars including Jaan Valsiner and Svend Brinkmann, Christiane Hartnack, Anand Paranjpe and Nick Hopkins. Finally, there is a rejoinder by the author Adrian Brock. I hope the discussion will bring in new ideas and invite further work towards situating the discipline in proper socio-historical and cultural context. The issue also contains many other articles that attend to issues in the Indian context. Taken together the articles strengthen the endeavor to bring cultural sensibility to the center stage of psychological discourse.",1
8,5,"As I look back, my only regret is that we did not have an opportunity to be more innovative in handling the manuscripts. Attempts have been made to reduce the publication lag. The support from my associate editors and reviewers has facilitated the publication procedure. I hope that the process may be planned more effectively and creative use of the journal may be enhanced. The potential for improvements in the publication process is always present. We are very fortunate in having Professor Damodar Suar assuming the editorship of Psychological Studies. It is hoped that under the able editorship of Professor Suar the journal will continue to promote psychology. In addition to being a productive researcher he has been serving as Associate Editor of the journal. He is familiar with the functioning of the journal. I welcome him and his team. With Professor Damodar Suar as Editor the journal is in excellent hands. I wish him success in his endeavor.",1
9,1,"Whereas retrospective studies suggest that crying can be beneficial in terms of mood enhancement, results of quasi-experimental laboratory studies consistently demonstrate its negative effects on mood. The present study was specifically designed to evaluate a parsimonious explanation for this paradox by assessing mood after crying in a laboratory, both immediately and at follow up. Mood ratings of 28 objectively established criers and 32 non-criers were compared before and immediately after the exposure to an emotional movie, as well as 20 and 90 min later. As expected, immediately after the film, negative mood significantly increased in criers, while it did not change in noncriers. This mood deterioration was followed by a recovery that resulted in return to the baseline mood levels at the third measurement. Criers subsequently reported mood enhancements at the final measurement compared to the pre-film measurement. Crying frequency did not predict mood changes above those predicted by the presence of crying. The observed relation between crying and more long-term mood recovery reconciles seemingly contrasting earlier results and provides a simple and obvious explanation. After the initial deterioration of mood following crying that was observed in laboratory studies, it apparently takes some time for the mood, not just to recover, but also to become even less negative than before the emotional event, which corresponds to the results of retrospective studies.",1
9,2,"Humans are the only species having the capacity to shed emotional tears, a behavior that is very common and present in all cultures (Trimble 2012; Vingerhoets 2013; Vingerhoets and Bylsma 2015). Nevertheless, it has received little attention of researchers and the understanding of its functions is still very limited. Theories on the functions of crying can be classified into two global categories (Vingerhoets 2013; Vingerhoets et al. 2009). The first one emphasizes the putative intra-individual benefits of crying, the catharsis effect. According to this view, crying facilitates recovery and homeostatic processes. The alternative view emphasizes the inter-individual functions of crying, which are represented in the communication of one¡¯s helplessness and need for support, and whose effects are evident in elicitation of comfort and succor (Hasson 2009). These two positions are not mutually exclusive but rather supplemental, because receiving comfort and emotional support may also contribute to an increased well-being after crying. Seen from a stress theoretical perspective, crying may be considered as a kind of coping behavior, serving several functions, ranging from facilitation of emotional recovery to an ultimate effort to persuade others to do something about the situation (Vingerhoets 2013).",1
9,3,"When trying to explain these seemingly discrepant findings, some critical methodological issues need to be taken into account. In retrospective studies, participants are generally free to choose which crying episodes they describe. It has been suggested that such a design leaves the possibility that participants preferred to report crying experiences that fit the popular notion that one feels better after having cried (Cornelius 1997). An additional problem in these retrospective studies is that it is not possible to precisely define the time interval between the crying episode and the reported feeling. Participants are usually asked to report how they feel after having cried, without specification how they felt immediately, 10 min or 1 h after crying. One may, of course, wonder whether that would make any sense, that is, whether it is possible for participants to remember exactly the time course of their mood changes. However, it nevertheless could be that, after having cried, people typically first experience a dip in their mood, which is subsequently logically followed by a mood improvement. We currently simply lack the necessary information about the precise time course of mood changes after crying that would help us to understand the popular postulate of emotional recovery that follows tears",1
9,4,"The present study has been especially designed to examine the immediate and delayed effects of crying on mood in a laboratory setting. To increase generalizability and validity, we decided to use stimuli that provoke tears through a wide spectrum of negative and positive emotions. In accordance with the results obtained in previous laboratory studies (Cornelius 1997), we predicted that increases in negative mood (here termed as negative affect, NA) immediately after the potential crying¨Celiciting films would be more pronounced in participants who cried than in participants who did not cry. Furthermore, based on the results of previous retrospective studies, we anticipated that at the delayed mood measurements, participants who cried would experience greater mood improvement compared to participants who did not cry, both in terms of recovery after initial mood deterioration and of overall mood improvement (i.e., compared to the pre-film baseline values). We also anticipated the presence of a dose¨Cresponse relationship between frequency of crying episodes and the changes in NA during the same time sequences.",1
9,5,The initial sample consisted of 46 female and 26 male students (age range 19¨C33; M = 23.80; SD = 3.19) who received course credits for participation. All participants provided written informed consent. Six participants were excluded from the analyses because of missing behavioural data due to equipment failure or because of incomplete questionnaire data.,1
9,6,"NA was assessed using the shortened version of the Emotional States Scale (Kardum and Bezinovic? 1992), containing 18 items on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (I do not feel this way at all) to 5 (I feel this way completely). The items were: nervous, bad tempered, anxious, weepy, tense, guilty, helpless, sad, angry, miserable, rejected, fearful, cheerful, generous, relaxed, calm, active and merry (last six items reversely keyed). The scale showed adequate internal consistency, with the Cronbach¡¯s alphas over the four measurements ranging from .77 to .84",1
9,7,"Participants were individually seated in a sound attenuated room approximately 60 cm from a 19 in. monitor, speakers and video-camera. After having signed the informed consent form, they completed the first mood rating (T1), which was immediately followed by the random exposure to one of the two films. After having watched the film, participants first filled in a short questionnaire about their emotional responses to films that is not in the scope of this study. This was followed by the second mood measurement (T2) after which they were accompanied by the experimenter to another room. After they had filled in additional questionnaires also not in the scope of this study, 20 min following T2 participants completed the mood questionnaire for the third time (T3). After being shortly debriefed, participants were given additional instructions and a closed envelope containing the mood scale which they were requested to complete and return immediately after having received an SMS message via mobile phone. Each participant left the laboratory 120 min after the beginning of the experiment. The fourth mood measurement (T4) took place 90 min after the second one and 60 min after the participants left the laboratory. Participants were not given any instructions how to behave during the 60 min after leaving the laboratory and before T4. The answers to the T4 measure were sent to the experimenter via text messages in which participants returned 18 numbers representing their responses on the mood scale items.",1
9,8,"First, independent samples t test, Chi square tests, and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to test the relations between all the relevant variables, in order to test for the existence of possible confounding variables that have to be controlled for. Next, in order to examine whether the groups of participants who cried and who did not cry differed in changes in NA between the four measurements, a 4 9 2 mixed ANOVA was performed with time period as a within-subjects factor (measurements at T1, T2, T3 and T4), group (non-crying and crying) as betweensubjects factor, and age and gender as covariates. Changes within the groups and between specific measurements were analyzed by comparison of NA between points in time for which the hypotheses were made: between (1) T1¨CT2 (expected mood deterioration), (2) T1 and T4 (expected overall mood enhancement), and (3) T2¨CT4 (expected recovery), by using two separate within-subjects ANOVAs (for each group), and Bonferroni post hoc tests. To validate the possibility that low mood in criers stimulated (successful) mood enhancing behaviors, we also performed an additional ANOVA by including NA change from T1 to T2 as a covariate.",1
9,10,"A significant main effect of time [F(3, 53) = 5.64; p = .002; partial g2 = .09] and a significant time 9 group interaction [F(2, 36) = 5.11; p = .003; partial g2 = .08] were found¡ªsee Fig. 1¡ªconfirming our hypothesis about the different course of mood changes in the crying and noncrying group. No main effect of the group [F(1, 55) = .83; p = .365; partial g2 = .02] was observed.",1
9,11,"To better understand the observed interaction two separate ANOVAs were performed in order to test whether there was a significant mood change in each of the two groups (p set to .025). There was no significant overall change in NA in the group of non-criers throughout the four measurements [F(3, 27) = 1.20; p = .311; partial g2 = .04]. However, in the group of criers, a significant effect of time was observed [F(3, 23) = 3.95; p = .021; partial g2 = .34]. Post hoc comparisons (Bonferroni correction) revealed that NA increased from T1 to T2 (p\.001), and decreased from T2 to T3 and from T2 to T4 (p\.001), thus supporting our hypotheses about initial deterioration and subsequent recovery of mood in criers. Most importantly, however, the decrease in NA from T1 to T4 in this group was also significant (p = .013), thus supporting our hypothesis about the overall mood improvements following crying. Finally, the predicted decreases in NA remained significant (recovery: p\.001; overall mood improvement: p = .007) when NA change from T1 to T2 was included as a covariate in an additional ANOVA.",1
9,13,"Perhaps it is in particular the strong mood improvement experienced by those participants who cried that fuels the popular notion that crying brings relief. It is obvious that decreases in NA from T2 to T4 and from T3 to T4 in participants who cried are mainly the consequences of previous (i.e., T1¨CT2) NA increases, that is, the return to baseline levels. This finding may explain why people report mood improvement after crying: those who cried indeed experience greater mood changes, be it after an initial deterioration. Such strong mood recovery, as well as the observed return of NA even to below baseline levels thus seems to support the hypothesis about the cathartic effects of crying. These findings are in accordance with both of our hypotheses about the negative effects of crying over the short run and about mood increases that follow crying over the longer run. On a more general level, these findings can be compared to the short-term negative and long-term positive effects of the expression of emotion on mood and well-being (Pennebaker 1997; Smyth 1998). However, the question remains whether these long-term mood-enhancing effects of crying and of other types of emotion expression are mediated by the same cognitive, physiological, or behavioral mechanisms.",1
9,14,"One could argue that the observed general decline in NA reported by criers at the final measurement is the consequence of increased tension and nervousness of the study participants at the beginning of the experiment, due to the fact that they are in a new and uncertain situation, rather than being the result of crying. However, if this mood improvement is considered as a kind of return to the (preexperiment) baseline level, it remains unclear why noncriers did not end up with improved mood at the final relative to the first measurement. Also note that both groups did not differ in NA at T1.",1
9,15,"A final critical and still unanswered question is whether the observed decreased NA really reflects a different mood state, induced by the crying, or that it reflects a kind of response shift, a phenomenon, which is well-known in the literature on quality of life in cancer patients. Repeatedly it has been found that cancer patients report a better quality of life than before their disease, when comparing their absolute scores on quality-of-life measures. However, when being asked to compare directly their current quality of life with before their disease (as is also done in retrospective studies on mood changes after crying), they indicate unanimously that their current state is worse than before their disease (Schwartz and Sprangers 1999). This response shift might be the result of changes in internal standards, conceptualization of the concepts, and/or one¡¯s values. This methodological issue certainly needs adequate consideration in future studies, for example by including a measure asking participants to compare directly their current mood state to the pre-film measurement. For future studies, we also suggest to pay an additional attention to factors that influence the memory of emotional events and mood, to stable individual differences related to affect intensity and variability, as well as to mood regulation processes.",1
9,16,"In conclusion, the present findings suggest a simple, obvious, and parsimonious explanation for the paradoxical findings of different studies investigating the effects of crying on mood. After the initial deterioration of mood following crying that is usually observed in laboratory studies, it takes some time for the mood, not just to recover, but also to increase above the levels that it had before the emotional event, a pattern of findings which corresponds to the results of retrospective studies.",1
10,1,"Transient brain responses to cues indicating the potential for reward may not be the only mechanism that links incentive information to enhanced cognitive control. It is possible that information about potential rewards may change cognitive processing and brain activity during the entire task in a more sustained fashion. A more recent line of research has examined state-dependent reward context effects on cognitive control, providing evidence for the presence of motivation-related Bstate effects on cognitive function, as evidenced by increased sustained activations across blocks of trials with incentive information (Engelmann et al., 2009; Jimura et al., 2010; Locke & Braver, 2008). For example, in a study by Engelmann et al. (2009) using a Posner-type task in which cues indicated the location of the face target stimulus, motivation was manipulated in a blocked fashion by varying the valence (e.g., winning, avoiding loss) and magnitude of the rewards associated with task performance (e.g., winning $1 or $4, or avoid losing $2.5 or $0). They found that in several regions in a fronto-parietal attentional network (i.e., the posterior intraparietal sulcus, middle frontal gyrus, the caudate, and putamen), cue-related responses were modulated by the incentive values. Importantly, they also found that several regions thought to be involved in the control of attention (e.g., the intraparietal sulcus and middle frontal gyrus) showed increased sustained activations across the course of blocks with greater incentive values. These results suggest that the enhancing effects of rewards on cognitive control can be evidenced in at least two ways: by (1)increases in cue-related responses, and (2)increases in sustained responses.",1
10,2,"Importantly, providing rewards or incentives does not lead to changes in behavioral performance and brain activity in all individuals. A growing body of research suggests that individual differences in reward-related sensitivity may modulate behavioral and neural responses to either primary (e.g., food) or secondary (i.e., monetary incentives) rewards (e.g., Beaver et al., 2006; Cooper, Duke, Pickering, & Smillie, 2014; Jimura et al., 2010; Locke & Braver, 2008). Specifically, several studies have reported associations between individual differences in reward-related personality traits and reward-related neural activations (e.g., Beaver et al., 2006; Cohen, Young, Baek, Kessler, & Ranganath, 2005; Cooper et al., 2014; Jimura et al., 2010; Locke & Braver, 2008). For example, Beaver et al. (2006) found that individual differences in Behavioral Inhibition and Behavioral Approach Systems (BIS/BAS) drive scores (i.e., items asking about the pursuit of goals) were significantly associated with neural responses to appetizing relative to bland foods in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex. Cohen et al. (2005) found that when participants received immediate monetary rewards during a gambling task, people higher in extraversion showed a greater magnitude of neural response related to reward receipt versus no reward in the right medial orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, and right nucleus accumbens. More recent work by Jimura et al. (2010) also showed positive associations between sustained DLPFC activations during reward context and reward sensitivity from the BAS. Thus, personality traits related to reward drive and sensitivity may be factors for understanding individual differences in incentive effects on cognitive control.",1
10,3,"However, another less explored individual-difference factor related to reward processing is anhedonia. Anhedonia is defined as a reduction in the ability to experience pleasure. Experiencing rewards as positive or pleasurable maybe a critical factor that induces approach behavior toward goals and positive emotional states (e.g., as is reviewed in Gorwood, 2008). Even nonclinical populations show individual differences in anhedonia (see, e.g., Franken, Rassin, & Muris, 2007; Harvey, Pruessner, Czechowska, & Lepage, 2007). Individuals who experience rewards as being less pleasurable may be less Bmotivated to modulate their behavior in order to enhance the likelihood of achieving such rewards. As such, individuals who self-report higher levels of anhedonia may show less improvement in cognitive control as a function of reward, and potentially less modulation for incentive-related brain activity, though it is less clear whether anhedonia may influence transient or sustained modulation of brain activity, or both.",1
10,4,"The purpose of this study was first to replicate prior work examining the neural mechanisms that mediate an enhancing effect of rewards on cognitive control, by examining sustained as well as incentive cue-related effects on cognitive control using a mixed state-item fMRI design. We focused on the DLPFC and the striatum, given prior research suggesting their involvement in mediating the influence of rewards on cognitive control. We modified a response conflict processing task originally developed by Padmala and Pessoa (2011) to fit in a mixed state-item design. The state-item fMRI design enabled us to examine sustained context-dependent effects and transient reward-related cue effects in the same study. Participants first performed baseline conditions without knowledge of the potential for incentives in future blocks. Participants then performed additional reward blocks on which they were told that they could win money on some trials (rewarded trials) by performing quickly and accurately. This variant of the paradigm enabled examinations of (1)reward context effects, by comparing performance and brain activity during the baseline versus the reward context, and (2)reward cue effects, by comparing performance during reward versus no-reward trials within reward blocks, as well as trials during the baseline blocks. We predicted that motivational states induced by reward contexts would produce greater sustained activity in the DLPFC than would those in nonincentive baseline blocks. We also predicted that incentive cues would generate increased transient neural activity in both reward-related cortical and subcortical regions.",1
10,5,"Second, we wanted to test the hypotheses that individual differences in self-reported anhedonia would moderate the influence of rewards on cognitive control, with higher levels of self-reported anhedonia being associated with less of an improvement in performance as a function of reward, as well as with less of an increase in the activity of the DLPFC and/or striatum in response to reward information, in terms of either sustained or transient activation (or both). To test these hypotheses, the present study included two measures of trait anhedonia: the Snaith¨CHamilton Pleasure Scale (Snaith et al., 1995) and the Social and Physical Anhedonia Scales (Chapman & Chapman, 1978; Eckblad, Chapman, Chapman, & Mishlove, 1982).",1
10,6,"All participants had no personal or family history of psychiatric or neurological disease. All participants were recruited through the Conte Center for the Neuroscience of Mental Disorders at Washington University in St. Louis and provided written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the Washington University Human Research Protection Office. Participants received a maximum of $20 reward money that depended on their correct and fast behavioral performance, in addition to money for completing the experiment ($25/h).",1
10,7,"As is presented in Fig. 1c, the baseline blocks consisted of two runs in which three different types of trials (i.e., congruent, incongruent, and neutral) were intermixed, with 18 trials per trial type (total of 54 trials). Each task block started with a start cue, BTASK, and ended with an end cue, BDONE, each presented for 2 s. After each start cue was a jittered period ranging from 0 to 4 s. During the baseline blocks, each trial started with an BXX cue for 1 s, with prior instruction to the participants indicating that these cues were not relevant to the task. Then a jittered fixation period occurred, ranging from 2 to 6 s before the onset of the stimuli, to allow for estimates of event-related responses to the cues. The target stimulus was next presented for 1 s, which was followed by a delay of 0.5 s, during which time the participants responded. Participants were then provided with visual feedback indicating whether their performance was correct or incorrect, for 1 s. Finally, there was an intertrial interval (ITI) that varied between 2, 4, and 6 s.",1
10,8,"After the two baseline runs, participants performed four additional runs, for which they were instructed that they could win money on some trials for their correct and fast responses, as is presented in Fig. 1d. The reaction time (RT) threshold to determine Bfast responses was set individually on the basis of the median correct RT for the second baseline run. During reward runs, half of the trials were preceded by a B$20 cue (reward cue: RC), indicating that a fast and correct response would be rewarded by 2,000 points, or by an BXX cue (reward context: RCXT), indicating that zero points would be possible on the trial. A total of 108 trials were presented, with approximately equal numbers of congruent, incongruent, and neutral trials. After the target stimulus, participants received feedback regarding the reward points they had earned on that trial, as well as their cumulative earning in points. The accumulated points were converted into real money at the end of the experiment (with a maximum of $20)",1
10,9,"All imaging data were preprocessed and analyzed using inhouse Washington University software (the FIDL analysis package: www.nil.wustl.edu/~fidl/). The first four images of each run were discarded to allow for signal stabilization. The functional-imaging data preprocessing included (1)correction for slice-dependent time shifts; (2)removal of the first four images of each run; (3)elimination of odd/even slice intensity differences due to interpolated acquisition; (4)realignment of the data to compensate for rigid-body motion; (5) normalization of image intensity to a whole-brain mode value of 1,000; (6)registration of the 3-D structural volume (T1) to the atlas template in the Talairach coordinate system, using a 12-parameter affine transform and resampling to a 1-mm cubic representation (Buckner et al., 2004; Ojemann et al., 1997) ; (7) coregistration of the 3-D fMRI volume to the T2, and the T2 to the structural image; (8) transformation of the fMRI data to a 3 ¡Á 3 ¡Á 3 mm voxel atlas space, using a single affine 12- parameter transform; and (9) spatial smoothing using a 6-mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian filter. We assessed head movement during scanning by using the output of the rigidbody rotation and translation algorithm. The translations and rotations in the x, y, and z planes across frames and the total root-mean-square (RMS) linear and angular precision measures were calculated for each run. If the standard deviation of the RMS movement exceeded 20, the BOLD runs were not included in the analysis [RMS/frame, as mean (SD): 27 participants = 0.15 (0.07)].",1
10,10,"Repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted on the median RTs for correct trials and accuracy, with the within-subjects factors Reward (BCXT, RC, RCXT) and Trial Type (congruent, incongruent, and neutral). Post-hoc paired ttests followed, used to determine the source of significant interactions. A behavioral index of reward context effects was estimated by subtracting the RT on RCXT trials, cued by BXX, from that on BCXT trials, with the same cue, BXX. An index of reward cue effects was computed by subtracting the RT on RC trials, cued by B$20, from that on RCXT trials, cued by BXX within the same reward conditions. These behavioral indices of reward context and cue effects were used in a Pearson correlation analysis to examine the associations between individual differences in anhedonia trait and behavioral enhancements of rewards on cognitive tasks.",1
10,11,"We used voxel-wise paired ttests to analyze the sustained estimates, with Reward (baseline, reward) as the withinsubjects factor. For cue-related activity, we conducted a voxel-wise repeated measures ANOVA with Reward (BCXT, RCXT, RC) and Time Point (the eight time frame estimates for the hemodynamic response) as within-subjects factors. We focused on regions showing interactions with time point, due to our use of unassumed GLMs. Post-hoc ANOVAs and ttests were performed within all significant regions identified by the ANOVAs, as we described above. For these post-hoc analyses, we extracted the mean percent signal change across each region for each time point out of the eight estimated time points, to visualize the pattern of activity. For the statistical analyses, we focused on Time Point 4, because this time point encompassed 7¨C8 s after stimulus onset, which corresponded to the initial peak in a stereotyped hemodynamic responses, unconfounded by sustained activity. This was done for each applicable cue type and trial type effect. We then conducted post-hoc paired ttests to compare the three trial types, to parse the significant cue-related and condition-related effects.",1
10,12,"For target-/receipt-related activation, we conducted two separate repeated measures ANOVAs. The first ANOVA ignored trial type (i.e., congruent, neutral, incongruent) and compared activation in the target phase across trials that could or could not earn reward in either the baseline or the reward blocks (i.e., Reward: BCXT, RCXT, or RC). Post-hoc paired t tests at Time Point 4 (i.e., BCXT¨CRC, RC¨CRCXT, BCXT¨C RCXT) were conducted to follow up on any significant effects. To attempt to replicate previous findings from prior work by Padmala and Pessoa (2011), another repeated measures ANOVA also included trial type (i.e., congruent, neutral, incongruent) and compared activation in the target phase across trials with activation in the reward context when participants could or could not earn reward, with Reward Context (i.e., BCXT, RC), Trial Type (i.e., congruent, neutral, incongruent trials), and Time Point as within-subjects factors.",1
10,13,"We constrained our analyses to a priori masks within the DLPFC and BG, given the involvement of these regions in reward processing (see, e.g., Jimura et al., 2010; Locke & Braver, 2008). We used anatomically defined masks of voxels within the DLPFC (Rajkowska & GoldmanRakic, 1995) and BG (Wang et al., 2008). Voxel-by-voxel neuroimaging analyses were conducted within these masks. All statistical activation maps from these masks were corrected for multiple comparisons using combined p-value and cluster thresholds, determined by the AlphaSim program in the AFNI software package. The DLPFC mask (Brodmann¡¯s areas 9 and 46) included both left and right middle and superior frontal gyri according to anatomical landmarks (Rajkowska & GoldmanRakic, 1995). For the DLPFC mask, we used as thresholds a z value of 2.05 and 13 voxels. The BG mask was based on Wang et al. (2008) and was generated by combining the caudate, nucleus accumbens, putamen, and globus pallidus together. We applied a z value of 2.05 and a 14-voxel threshold for the BG mask. Then we used information about the centroid of activation in these identified subregions to label them as a specific area. For any follow-up analyses to identify the sources of significant effects and further correlations analyses, as described above, we extracted the average of the BOLD response values of the voxels within the identified subregions within the mask regions and imported them into SPSS.",1
10,14,"We examined whether individual differences in anhedonia predicted behavior and/or the degree of brain activations as a function of rewards in the regions of interest (ROIs) that showed sustained reward and transient cue effects within each DLPFC and BG mask. We examined whether either of the following individualdifference measures predicted behavior, the magnitude of sustained brain activation during reward versus baseline contexts, or transient activation during RC versus RCXT trials: (1)total SHPS scores and (2)a composite score of the Chapman social and physical anhedonia scores (z-scored and then combined into one composite score). The brain¨Cpersonality trait correlations were corrected by using the same smallvolume procedures described above.",1
10,15,"The analogous ANOVA on the error data indicated a significant main effect of trial type [F(2, 52) = 13.91, p < .001, ¦Çp 2 = .35], reflecting more errors on incongruent than on congruent trials [F(1, 26) = 16.36, p < .001, ¦Çp 2 = .38]. We observed no significant main effect of reward [F(2, 52) = 1.20, p = .31, ¦Çp 2 = .04] and no significant interaction of reward and trial type [F(4, 104) = 0.83, p = .51, ¦Çp 2 = .03]. Given the lack of a significant main effect of reward on the error data, further analyses were focused on the RT data.",1
10,16,"Individuals reporting greater anhedonia on the Chapman scales showed less cue-related activation as a function of reward-predicting cues in the lateral globus pallidus (r = ¨C.54, p = .003; see Fig. 5A for a scatterplot), an effect that passed Bonferroni correction (.05/6). We saw a similar relationship in this region to self-report of hedonic tone on the SHPS, with greater hedonic tone being associated with greater cue-related activation as a function of reward-predicting cues in the lateral globus pallidus (r = .45, p = .02; see Fig.5B), though this correlation did not pass Bonferroni correction.",1
10,17,"Regions in the DLPFC and the BG that displayed a significant reward context effect showed two patterns of results (see Table 4). In the top panel of Table 4, regions in the DLPFC and the BG show reduced target-related activation on RC relative to RCXT or BCXT trials. For example, in the medial portion of the right DLPFC (BA 9: x = 26, y = 37, z = 29), target-related activation on RC and RCXT trials was significantly reduced relative to BCXT trials. Interestingly, in several subcortical regions, such as the lateral globus pallidus, targetrelated activity at Time Point 4 did not differ among rewardrelated types. However, the source of the significance effect was observed at Time Point 7, with a greater degree of deactivation on RC than on BCXT and RCXT trials (see Fig. 6 for time courses from the DLPFC and BG regions displaying Reward Context ¡Á Time Point effects in the target phase). In the bottom panel of the same table, a different set of larger, more lateral, and more posterior regions in the DLPFC showed greater activation on RC relative to BCXT trials (see Supplemental Fig. 2 for the time courses of each region in the DLPFC).",1
10,18,"In the present study, activation was increased in response to incentive cues versus no-incentive cues in bilateral DLPFC and in several reward-related subcortical regions, such as the lateral globus pallidus and caudate. These results are in line with prior work (e.g., Padmala & Pessoa, 2011; Vassena et al., 2014), which also showed transient increases in a distributed network of several regions, including the lateral PFC and parietal cortex, that are thought to be engaged in cognitive control (Owen, McMillan, Laird, & Bullmore, 2005; Wager & Smith, 2003).",1
10,19,"The DLPFC has traditionally been considered a core component of cognitive control, as we described in the introduction. Recently, accumulated evidence has suggested that the DLPFC represents reward-related value information as well as Bcold information about task goals (see Dixon & Christoff, 2014, for a recent review). Furthermore, anatomical evidence has shown that the DLPFC is strongly connected with key regions involved in value representations, such as the orbitofrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex (Pandya, Van Hoesen, & Mesulam, 1981; Petrides & Pandya, 1999, 2007). Also, the DLPFC (BA 9/10) projects to the BG, including the caudate nucleus and the globus pallidus. Projections from these striatal regions terminate in the thalamus, which in turn projects back to the DLPFC and to premotor and motor cortices (Joel & Weiner, 1994, 1997). With regard to this circuit of anatomical connections, the increased DLPFC and striatal activations in response to incentive cues might reflect enhanced neural representations of reward value through a top-down regulation of activations in this circuit.",1
10,20,"Several regions in the BG also showed greater sustained activity during reward contexts. The present results extend prior work by suggesting that regions in a fronto-parietal network can show sustained increases with regard to reward information. For example, both Jimura et al. (2010) and Locke and Braver (2008) found sustained increases in the parietal cortex as well as the lateral PFC during reward contexts, but did not find effects in the BG. However, in the present study we conducted a hypothesis-driven analysis using an a priori ROI approach, whereas the previous studies had used voxelwise whole-brain analysis. It is possible that this ROI approach offered greater power to detect sustained effects in both prefrontal and striatal regions (Nieto-Castanon, Ghosh, Tourville, & Guenther, 2003). This sustained activity may be reflective of BG¡¯s hypothesized role in reward-based learning and goal-directed behavior (Dasgupta, Worgotter, & Manoonpong, 2014; Schultz, Tremblay, & Hollerman, 1998). Especially, the dorsal striatum is known to receive extensive projections from the DLPFC as well as other frontal regions. Thus, increased sustained activity in the dorsal striatum during the reward context may have represented greater effort to maintain reward-related context information, which may facilitate preparatory responses throughout reward contexts.",1
10,21,"In the present study, we found that people reporting greater trait anhedonia showed less neural activation as a function of reward-predicting cues, but that there was no significant association between anhedonia and sustained context-dependent activation during reward contexts. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that anhedonia, or reductions in the ability to experience pleasure, may influence the degree to which the experience of rewards (or Bliking) influences modulations of brain activation or behavior in response to the explicit presentation of reward cues, as occurred on RC trials. However, these results do not support the idea that anhedonia influences more global effects of incentives that are reflected in either the sustained aspects of brain activation or the behavioral effects of reward context. As we discussed in the introduction, without having positive experiences/expectations of rewards, it may be hard to exert the effort to pursue goal-directed behavior, potentially providing one mechanism by which individual differences in anhedonia may influence behavior.",1
10,22,"Although this study provides crucial insight into one potential neural mechanism underlying anhedonia, it has several limitations that may be answered in future studies. One limitation to this study is that we did not find significant reductions in conflict effects in either accuracy or RT, though we did find a speeding of RT as a function of reward, without a sacrifice in accuracy. Consistent with these behavioral findings, we did not find significant regions displaying interaction effects of reward context and trial type in the target phase, though our analyses were focused on the DLPFC and the basal ganglia. As we discussed above, we cannot exclude a possibility that the difficulty level of present task may not have been optimally adjusted to tap cognitive control among community populations. Future research varying the difficulty level of task performance is needed to understand how engagement of the DLPFC to modulate cognitive control in reward contexts is moderated by the challenge level of the tasks. In summary, the present findings show both sustained context-dependent and transient cue-driven effects of reward on cognitive control thought to be supported by the DLPFC and the basal ganglia. Importantly, self-reported anhedonia trait in healthy adults were associated with transient neural activity during reward predictions implicated in the lateral globus pallidus, but not with sustained DLPFC activity.",1
10,23,"Another major limitation is that, due to the fixed-order presentation of the baseline and reward conditions, the sustained context-dependent effect might have reflected practice-related effects. However, our differences between reward conditions are unlikely to have been due to practice effects, given the previous empirical evidence against this possibility. For example, Chiew and Braver (2013) examined the effect of reward incentives on cognitive control, as measured by the AX-continuous performance task (AX-CPT). Like us, they utilized a mixed block/event design. In the AX-CPT, in which participants perform baseline (no incentive offered) and reward blocks, within the reward blocks, nonincentive trials are randomly intermixed with the incentive trials. In Chiew and Braver¡¯s supplementary analysis, they broke down each block into four 50-trial epochs, and found that potential practice effects disappeared after the first epoch, whereas incentive effects remained throughout. Furthermore, the differences between our RCXT and RC trials cannot be due to practice effects, since these trials were interleaved.",1
10,24,"The present mixed state-item design allowed us to start to dissociate sustained versus transient effects of rewards. However, additional approaches could be used in future studies to further dissociate these effects. In particular, our design did not provide an estimate of the effects of sustained rewards in the absence of transient trial-by-trial effects. Thus, an alternative future design would be to include conditions in which participants were informed that there would be a bonus at the end of a block of trials for overall improved performance, but no trial-specific reward cues. With such a manipulation, one could create a crossed design in which there either was or was not an overall block-wise manipulation of reward bonus (e.g., context effect: high vs. low sustained reward motivation) versus the presence or absence of trial-by-trial cues about the potentially of additional rewards (transient effect: reward cue vs. no-reward cue trials).",1

11,1,"The current study was a 7-year follow-up of 74 6¨C12 year old children with Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified. We examined the rates and 7 year stability of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses as ascertained with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children: Parent version at ages 6¨C12 and again at ages 12¨C20. Also, we examined childhood factors that predicted the stability of comorbid psychiatric disorders. The rate of comorbid psychiatric disorders dropped significantly from childhood (81 %) to adolescence (61 %). Higher levels of parent reported stereotyped behaviors and reduced social interest in childhood significantly predicted the stability of psychiatric comorbidity. Re-evaluation of psychiatric comorbidity should be considered in clinical practice, since several individuals shifted in comorbid diagnoses.",1
11,3,"Inclusion criteria were: (1) meeting the research criteria for PDD-NOS in childhood (n = 94; De Bruin et al. 2007; Buitelaar et al. 1999), and (2) participation of the parents in the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children: Parent version ([DISC-IV-P], Ferdinand and Van der Ende 1998; Shaffer et al. 2000), in childhood (n = 94, wave 1; age 6¨C12, M = 9.02, SD = 1.81) and 7 years later, in adolescence (n = 74, wave 2; age 12¨C20, M = 16.00, SD = 1.92). The average follow-up time between the DISC-IV-P at wave 1 and wave 2 was 6.95 years (range 5.58¨C8.82 year; SD: 0.64).",1

However, individuals whose parents participated at both wave 1 and wave 2 had significantly higher IQ-scores (M = 92.96, SE = 16.96) versus individuals whose parents only participated at wave 1 [M = 83.94, SE = 16.88; t(86) = -2.01, p = .05].",1

Parents were interviewed by phone by trained and certified research assistants. The DISC-IV-P was used to assess internalizing disorders (i.e. anxiety and mood disorders) and externalizing disorders (i.e. disruptive disorders) at wave 1 and 2 and was scored using the internet software (Steenhuis et al. 2009) of the Dutch translation of the DISC-IV-P (Ferdinand and Van der Ende 1998). The anxiety disorder module consists of nine disorders; social phobia (SoPh), separation anxiety disorder (SAD), specific phobia (SP), panic disorder (PD), agoraphobia (AG), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), selective mutism (SM), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The mood disorder module consists of major depressive episode (MDD), dysthymia, and manic/hypomanic episode. The disruptive behaviors are subdivided in the DISC-IV-P in: ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and CD.",1
11,6,"To examine whether the level and type of parent-rated ASD symptoms in childhood (i.e. wave 1) was associated with the stability of comorbidity, the CSBQ was used. The CSBQ is a parental questionnaire, which contains 49 items about a broad range of features that are typical for ASD (Hartman et al. 2006; Luteijn et al. 1998). The items are scored on a three-point scale (i.e. 0: behavior does not apply; 1: behavior sometimes or somewhat applies; 2: behavior clearly or often applies to the child). The CBSQ consists of six subscales; (1) ¡®¡®not optimally tuned to the social situation¡¯¡¯, (2) ¡®¡®reduced contact and social interest¡¯¡¯, (3) ¡®¡®orientation problems in time, place or activity¡¯¡¯, (4) ¡®¡®difficulties in understanding social information¡¯¡¯, (5) ¡®¡®stereotyped behavior¡¯¡¯ and (6) ¡®¡®fear of and resistance to changes¡¯¡¯.

11,7,"To examine whether IQ in childhood (i.e. wave 1) was associated with the stability of comorbidity, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R; Wechsler 1974) was administered. This instrument comprises a verbal scale (VIQ) and a performance scale (PIQ) together forming a total scale (TIQ). The Dutch version of the WISC-R has been demonstrated to be sufficiently reliable and valid (Van Haasen et al. 1986).",1
11,8,"To assess the use of mental health care and medication between wave 1 and 2, a parent questionnaire was administered at wave 2 (Amone-P¡¯Olak et al. 2010). Eight questions concerned use of mental health care with regard to emotional and/or behavioral problems of the child. These items were scored as 0 (i.e. not used) or 1 (i.e. used). If any of these items was scored 1, the variable ¡®mental health care¡¯ was scored 1. Parents were also asked if their child had used psychotropic medication in the past 2 weeks. This variable was also scored as 0 (i.e. not used) or 1 (i.e. used).",1
11,9,"Firstly, the rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders were calculated at wave 1 and wave 2. The significance of putative changes in the prevalence rates was tested using McNemar tests. To investigate the stability of comorbid psychiatric disorders from childhood to adolescence, we made a cross-table of the presence or absence of comorbid disorders at wave 1 and wave 2 (i.e. proportions of individuals in the following groups: 1: ¡®¡®persistent presence¡¯¡¯, 2: ¡®¡®from presence to absence¡¯¡¯, 3: ¡®¡®from absence to presence¡¯¡¯ and 4: ¡®¡®persistent absence¡¯¡¯).

11,10,"To examine whether gender, age, IQ, level and type of parent-rated ASD symptoms (CSBQ scores), intermediate mental health care and medication were associated with the stability of psychiatric disorders, we compared the group with persistent disorders (n = 38, ¡®¡®persistent presence¡¯¡¯) with the group that changed from disorder to no disorder (n = 22, ¡®¡®from presence to absence¡¯¡¯) and the group with persistent absence of disorders (n = 7, ¡®¡®persistent absence¡¯¡¯) with the group that changed from no disorder to disorder (n = 7, ¡®¡®from absence to presence¡¯¡¯).

For the smaller groups ¡®¡®persistent absence¡¯¡¯ and ¡®¡®from absence to presence¡¯¡¯, nonparametric testing (i.e. Mann¨CWhitney U test and Binomial test) was used.",1

Of the individuals who had no comorbid psychiatric disorder in childhood (n = 14), 50 % (n = 7) stayed free of a comorbid psychiatric disorder in adolescence, whereas 50 % (n = 7) of the individuals developed at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder in adolescence.",1
11,12,"To further clarify this finding, a post hoc test was performed to reveal possible predictors specific for persistent externalizing versus persistent internalizing disorders. In both cases, only parent-reported stereotyped behavior was a significant predictive factor for persistence of the same psychiatric comorbidities [i.e. respectively (t(40) = -2.953, p = .005); (t(39) = -3.287, p = .002)].",1

11,14,"The rate of MDD increased slightly from 8 % in childhood to 11 % in adolescence. These rates are in line with those known from the literature, although higher (i.e. 16 %) and much lower rates (i.e. 1 %) have also been reported among individuals with ASD (Leyfer et al. 2006; Simonoff et al. 2008; Mazefsky et al. 2011; Van Steensel et al. 2013; Witwer and Lecavalier 2010). In the general population, also an increase in depression from childhood to adolescence has been found (Maughan et al. 2013), suggesting a similar developmental process.",1
11,15,"The rate of comorbid ADHD decreased from childhood (45 %) to adolescence (39 %). These relatively high rates are in line with previous studies (Goldstein and Schwebach 2004; Leyfer et al. 2006; Mazefsky et al. 2011), although lower rates have also been reported among individuals with ASD (Abdallah et al. 2011; Hanson et al. 2013; Simonoff et al. 2008; Van Steensel et al. 2013). The current study found a decrease for the hyperactivity type of ADHD and the combined type of ADHD in individuals with PDD-NOS from childhood to adolescence, but an increase for the inattentive type of ADHD in adolescence, with 15 new cases in adolescence. This change in the occurrence of ADHD in individuals with PDD-NOS is in line with the suggested trajectory of development of ADHD with hyperactivity at preschool age, more normoactive behavior during the early school years and a tendency to hypoactivity in early adolescence (Gillberg and Billstedt 2000). In adolescence, transition to secondary education increases attentional demands and peer pressures, with the potential to amplify previously unnoticed problems.",1
11,16,"Taken together, the overall prevalence of parent-reported psychiatric comorbidity decreased from childhood to adolescence. Variation in the prevalence of comorbid disorders across different studies may be explained by methodological differences in aspects such as methods of assessment and diagnosis, and how samples were constituted (i.e. differences in levels and types of care in different institutions). Our own data showed no particular transitions from one type of comorbidity to another; only 2 cases shifted from having an internalizing to an externalizing diagnosis, and one from an externalizing to an internalizing one. Although our dataset is limited, cross-domain transitions seem infrequent, and domain stability seems most common",1
11,17,"The current study suggested two predictors of stable psychiatric comorbidity from childhood to adolescence. Children with stable psychiatric comorbidity showed a higher childhood level of parent-reported stereotyped behavior and reduced contact and social interest. Post-hoc analyses also showed that parent-reported stereotyped behaviors were predictive for the persistent presence of either internalizing or externalizing disorders. Thus, our preliminary findings suggest that parent-reported stereotyped behaviors might be an indication for persistent comorbidity. There were no significant predictors for the persistent absence of comorbidity, although there probably was a lack of power to detect these, since these groups were very small. To our knowledge, no previous studies investigated childhood predictors of comorbidity in adolescence, so further research is needed to corroborate our findings.",1
11,19,Our sample of children was diagnosed with PDD-NOS. But one may wonder how these findings apply to individuals diagnosed with ASD using current DSM 5 criteria. The children in our sample also were part of a larger study on phenotypic profiles of children with PDD (Greaves-Lord et al. 2013). This study has found that about 30 % of the sample had a profile more in line with the more recent DSM-5 diagnosis of Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder. The reader should interpret our findings against this background.,1
11,20,"Our wave 2 YSR self-report data was used to provide information on adolescents¡¯ internalizing comorbidities through post hoc exploration. Contrary to our expectations we found lower self-reported rates of anxiety rates (15.2 %) than parent-reported DISC-P wave 2 rates (31.1 %). We had expected to see higher self-reported than parent-reported rates of internalizing problems, given that adolescents might not openly share these emotions with their parents. In line with expectations, we found a somewhat higher rate of self-reported depressive symptoms (18.2 %¡ªin the subclinical range) when compared to the parent-reported DISC-P wave 2 rate of 10.8 %. DISC-P data cannot be directly compared to YSR data due to the rather different properties of these instruments, and the lack of comparative research on these two measures. We hope these data provide some background information that helps to broaden the picture from our main analyses. Further research would be needed to profile the longitudinal trajectories of self-reported comorbidities in this group",1

12,1,"In two experiments, rats received pairings of the flavor of almond with either fructose or maltodextrin, and the conditioned preference for almond was then tested. In each experiment, half of the rats had received prior exposure to almond on its own, and half had received no preexposure. In Experiment 1, in which the rats were hungry during the test, the preference was greater in the nonpreexposed subjects, both for those trained with fructose and those trained with maltodextrin; that is, latent inhibition was obtained with both reinforcers. In Experiment 2, in which the rats were not food deprived prior to the test, not only was there no latent inhibition with either of the reinforcers, but, for both, the preference was greater for preexposed than for nonpreexposed subjects. These results give no support to the proposal that different types of reinforcer generate different types of learning. They are, however, consistent with the proposal that different types of learning control behavior when a rat is hungry and when it is not, and that the form that generates the preference in the latter case is not susceptible to the latent inhibition effect.",1
12,2,"Prior exposure to the event to be used as the conditioned stimulus (CS) in classical conditioning is usually found to retard acquisition of the conditioned response. This latent inhibition effect is robust and is readily obtained in a wide variety of conditioning procedures (see Lubow, 1989). An exception, however, is the flavor-preference conditioning procedure used in the experiments considered here. In this procedure, subjects (rats, in these experiments) are allowed to consume a neutral or nonpreferred flavor that is presented in compound with a substance of positive motivational value (such as a sucrose solution). After this training, rats given a choice between plain water and water containing the flavor show an increased tendency to consume the latter, an outcome that has been interpreted as an instance of conditioning, with the flavor serving as the CS and sucrose as the unconditioned stimulus (US). Exposure to the CS prior to such conditioning has produced varying results. De la Casa, M¨¢rquez, and Lubow (2009) found a reduction in the preference (i.e., latent inhibition), whereas Delamater (2011) found no effect (at least on initial testing; a difference emerged on a further test given after the rats had been given exposure to the US alone).",1
12,3,"A possible interpretation of these findings has come from the suggestion that more than one mechanism can contribute to the preference established with sucrose as the US. Sucrose has both a sweet taste and nutritive postoral consequences, and each of these properties is capable of supporting preference conditioning. A palatable but nonnutritive substance (such as saccharin) will serve as an effective US (e.g., Fanselow & Birk, 1982), a phenomenon referred to as flavor¨Ctaste learning. But a preference can also be formed when a nutrient US is delivered by intragastric infusion (e.g., Sclafani, Cardieri, Tucker, Blusk, & Ackroff, 1993), so that its taste properties are irrelevant. We refer to this as flavor¨C nutrient learning. The implication is that sucrose, when taken orally and subsequently metabolized, supports both forms of learning",1
12,4,"To test this interpretation of the results of Garcia-Burgos et al. (2013), it would be useful to have available procedures that allow for separate examinations of flavor¨Cnutrient and flavor¨Ctaste learning. The former would be expected to show latent inhibition; the latter, not. A little information is already available, from experiments using somewhat unorthodox procedures. Weingarten and Kulikovsky (1989) reported results from a study investigating rats¡¯ response to sham-feeding, which they interpreted as supporting the proposal that preexposure to a flavor restricts the learning of an association between the flavor and the postingestive consequences of feeding. In contrast, no latent inhibition was found in a study by Galef and Durlach (1993), in which the training procedure involved allowing the subject rat to interact with another that had recently eaten food with a particular flavor. The enhanced flavor preference induced by this training (taken to reflect an association between the odor of the flavor and other cues produced by the demonstrator rat) was not prevented by preexposure to the flavor. Although these results are suggestive and consistent with the hypothesis under consideration, they come from complex procedures in which a range of factors would be operating, and alternative interpretations might be possible. Accordingly, in the experiments to be reported here, we have made use of the standard preferenceconditioning procedure and have attempted to isolate flavor¨C taste and flavor¨Cnutrient learning by making use of substances other than sucrose as the USs",1
12,5,"We acknowledge that the effects of these different USs may well be more complex than this. As we have just noted, intragastric fructose can support a degree of preference learning (albeit rather less strong than that produced by sucrose), implying that flavor¨Cnutrient learning will occur to some extent with fructose. and Myers and Sclafani (2001) have demonstrated, using a taste reactivity test, that rats show positive responses to a flavor that has been associated with intragastric infusion of a sugar, implying that flavor¨Cnutrient learning (like flavor¨Ctaste learning) may be capable of changing the hedonic response to a flavor. None the less, the strategy of comparing fructose with maltodextrin has been used with some success to address other issues in flavor-preference learning (e.g., Dwyer & Quirk, 2008), and accordingly, we thought it worthwhile to look for latent inhibition in flavorpreference learning in rats trained with either fructose or maltodextrin as the US. Evidence of an effect with the latter but not the former would support the hypotheses (a) that different mechanisms underlie the preferences established by these USs, and (b) that the mechanism engaged by fructose (presumed to be flavor¨Ctaste learning) is not susceptible to latent inhibition.",1
12,6,"We created four groups of rats: Two were given preexposure to the almond flavor that was to be used as the CS, and the other groups received only water at this stage. During conditioning, one pair of groups consumed a mixture of almond and fructose, and the other pair a mixture of almond and maltodextrin. In a final test, all subjects were given access to two bottles, one containing the almond solution, and the other, unflavored water. In order to ensure that they would drink the fluids offered, the rats were water deprived throughout training. They had free access to food during preexposure and conditioning, but, given that a preference based on flavor¨Cnutrient learning (such as maltodextrin is likely to produce) may only be fully evident in hungry animals, access to food was denied all subjects prior to the test.",1
12,7,"All of the experimental procedures were approved by the University of Granada Ethics Committee. To initiate the deprivation schedule, the water bottles were removed 24 h before the start of the experiment. The rats were then given three days to accommodate to a deprivation schedule, in which access to water was allowed twice a day for 30 min, at 9:00 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. Rats were randomly allocated to two weight-matched groups¡ªgroup Pre (n = 16) and group NPre (n = 16)¡ªfor the flavor exposure phase. This phase consisted of one single daily trial (at 9:00 a.m.) across eight days. Each trial consisted of 10 min access to 10 ml of either almond (for animals in the Pre condition) or water (for animals in the NPre condition), followed by free access to water for 30 min. An additional 30-min period of access to water was given each day at 1:30 p.m. After the exposure phase, rats were divided into four groups for the conditioning phase, matched on either average almond (groups Pre) or water (groups NPre) consumption during the preexposure phase, Pre/M (n = 8), NPre/M (n = 8), Pre/F (n = 8), and NPre/F (n = 8).",1
