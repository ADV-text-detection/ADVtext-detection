"Neurogenesis is a process that is strictly regulated in order to create and maintain the complex architecture of the central nervous system. This phenomenon is a cellular plasticity mechanism in the adult brain, whereby new neurons are generated from neural stem cells. Neurogenesis involves various events, such as proliferation, restricting precursor cells to neuronal lineages, cell cycle arrest, migration, integration, and maturation, ultimately leading to functionally active neurons. The expression of doublecortin (DCX) is associated with the identification of neuronal precursors and newly generated neurons. DCX expression is mainly detected in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the subventricular zone/rostral migration stream/olfactory bulb axis. Scientists have established methods that use transgenic mice to study neurogenesis through the activation of reporter genes using the DCX promoter.","Neurogenesis is a carefully regulated process that both creates and sustains the complex cytoarchitecture of the central nervous system. Neurogenesis also plays a crucial role in the adult brain's cellular plasticity by continuously generating new neurons from resident neural stem cells. This process unfolds in several orderly stages: proliferation, lineage restriction, cell cycle cessation, migration, integration, differentiation, and functional and morphological maturation. At the end of this process, the newly formed neurons are fully integrated and active. Scientists use the expression of doublecortin (DCX) to identify these newly generated neurons and neuronal precursors. DCX expression is detected primarily in the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the subventricular zone/rostral migration stream/olfactory bulb axis. Previously, the generation of transgenic mice equipped with reporter genes driven by the DCX promoter has enabled the monitoring of neurogenesis in these mice, both in vitro and in vivo.","Neurogenesis is a highly controlled process that maintains the complex cytoarchitecture of the central nervous system. In addition, neurogenesis is a form of neural plasticity in the adult brain as it continuously produces new neurons from the resident neural stem cells. The process involves several sequential events, such as proliferation, neuronal lineage restriction, cell cycle arrest, migration to target area, differentiation, and final maturation that leads to functional and morphological changes. At the end of the process, the newly generated cells become active and integrated neurons. The expression of doublecortin (DCX) has been identified as a marker for newly generated neurons and neuronal precursors. DCX expression is detected in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone/rostral migration stream/olfactory bulb axis. Researchers have created transgenic mice equipped with the DCX promoter to monitor neurogenesis both in vitro and in vivo through the activation of reporter genes."
"It is crucial to comprehend neurogenesis at both molecular and cellular levels to explore the potential of using it in therapeutic approaches for pathological neuronal losses. The role of abnormal neurogenesis in neuropsychiatric pathogenesis has been suggested by emerging evidence. Thus, various models, including transgenic models, have been developed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying neurogenesis in vivo. For instance, models with cell-type specific promoters such as nestin, GLAST, PLP, or DCX are used to investigate neural stem cells, radial glia, oligodendroglial precursors, and neuronal precursors, respectively.These models have been useful in the past, but they are not ideal for long-term studies such as fate mapping or assessing the long-term functional integration of newly generated neurons. The limitation is increased by the transient (mostly less than 1 month in rodents' DG and OB) expression of the DCX reporter in areas such as the SVZ/OB axis and the dentate gyrus, where DCX expression is detected only in newly formed neurons. As a result, these reporter mice are not suitable for carrying out fate mapping studies.","A comprehensive understanding of neurogenesis at both molecular and cellular levels is essential in developing therapeutic techniques to replace pathological neuronal losses. Emerging evidence indicates that abnormal neurogenesis may contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of neurogenesis in vivo, various models have been developed over the years, such as transgenic models utilizing cell-type specific promoters including nestin, GLAST, PLP, or DCX, which have been invaluable in the investigation of neural stem cells, radial glia, oligodendroglial precursors, and neuronal precursors. However, these models are not conducive to long-term studies such as fate mapping, or the long-term functional integration of newly generated neurons. In the dentate gyrus and the SVZ/OB axis, for example, DCX expression is only transient (mostly less than 1 month in rodents), rendering the DCX reporter mice unsuitable for fate mapping studies.","A better understanding of neurogenesis, at both molecular and cellular levels, is required to develop therapeutic strategies for replacing pathological neuronal losses. There is mounting evidence that abnormal neurogenesis may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. Consequently, various models have been developed over the years, including transgenic models that rely on cell-type-specific promoters such as nestin, GLAST, PLP, or DCX. These models are used to explore the biology of neural stem cells, radial glia, oligodendroglial precursors, and neuronal precursors, respectively. Nonetheless, long-term studies, such as fate tracing, and investigations into the integration of newly generated neurons, are not feasible with these reporter mice. In the dentate gyrus and the SVZ/OB axis, DCX expression is transient, lasting mostly less than 1 month in rodents. As a result, DCX reporter mice are not an ideal option for fate mapping studies."
"To address the lack of a suitable tool for analyzing the fate of neuronal precursors, we developed transgenic mice that harbored the tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase gene under the regulation of the DCX promoter. Our research reveals that this advanced transgenic tool provides the opportunity for the creation of clear and regular labels for newly generated neurons and their fate can be tracked for an extended period. Additionally, it is an effective means for the regulation of gene expression within a critical time frame for neural differentiation and understanding the functional implications of such regulation.","In order to solve the issue of lacking a suitable tool that aids in the analysis of neuronal precursor fate, we developed transgenic mice which possess the tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase gene controlled by the DCX promoter. Our studies show that this novel transgenic tool allows for a time-resolved and long-term analysis of the fate of newly generated neurons. Additionally, it offers a means of regulating the expression of genes within an important time frame during neuronal maturation, enabling the exploration of the functional implications of such regulation.","To address the absence of an appropriate means of analyzing the fate of neuronal precursors, we generated transgenic mice containing the tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase gene, which is regulated by the DCX promoter.

Furthermore, it permits the regulation of gene expression within a crucial developmental stage of neurons, enabling researchers to investigate the functional consequences of such regulation."
"The CreERT2 cDNA was incorporated into the phuDCX-3509-DsRed2 cassette by subcloning a 2380-bp Sal I-Not I fragment of pCAG-CreERT2bpA-SS1 vector, which contains the CreERT2 cDNA, into the BamH I and Not I site.

In the SVZ and dentate gyrus, adult neurogenic regions, both DCX-CreERT2 transgenic lines exhibited the anticipated TAM-induced b-gal expression (Additional file 1). No b-gal activity was observed in the progeny derived from founder 2 following vehicle injection. However, in mice from founder 1, numerous b-gal positive profiles were identified after vehicle injection, indicating unspecific recombination events (data not shown). Therefore, only the transgenic DCXCreERT2 founder 2 line was expanded and used for subsequent analysis.","In order to evaluate Cre-recombinase activity, F1 generation of two founder-derived lines were mated with Rosa26 lacZ reporter mice to activate a lacZ expression after recombination [23]. Adult neurogenic regions including the SVZ and dentate gyrus were observed for b-gal activity in two-month-old DCX-CreERT2:Rosa26 lacZ mice following a tamoxifen (TAM) or vehicle injection. As expected, both DCX-CreERT2 transgenic lines showed TAM-induced b-gal expression in these regions (Additional file 1). Progeny of founder 2 did not display any b-gal activity after vehicle injections. However, founder 1 mice had multiple b-gal positive profiles detected following vehicle injection, indicating random recombination events (data not shown). Consequently, only the transgenic DCXCreERT2 founder 2 line was expanded and used for further examination."
"To validate that CreERT2 expression along with endogenous DCX expression aligns in the DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice, the respective expression patterns were analyzed. At a cellular level, almost all DCX+ cells in the developing CNS showed CreERT2 expression (E15.5). Moreover, one day post-injection of TAM, CreERT2 was observed to have moved to the nucleus (Figure 1a). Correspondingly, in the adult brain, CreERT2 expression was restricted to the nucleus of DCX+ cells one day after TAM injection (Figure 1b). The administration of TAM induced nuclear localization, which is necessary for CreERT2 activity [24].","To validate that CreERT2 expression coincides with endogenous DCX expression in DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice, the expression patterns were compared. At the cellular level, CreERT2 was detected in nearly all DCX+ cells of the developing CNS (E15.5). Furthermore, one day after TAM injection, CreERT2 was observed to have translocated to the nucleus (Figure 1a). Correspondingly, in the adult brain, CreERT2 expression was highly specific to the nucleus of DCX+ cells one day after TAM injection (Figure 1b). Nuclear localization of CreERT2 is induced by TAM administration and is essential for CreERT2 activity [24].","In order to confirm that CreERT2 expression matches the endogenous DCX expression in DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice, the respective expression patterns were analyzed. At the cellular level, CreERT2 was detected in almost all DCX+ cells of the developing CNS (E15.5). Additionally, one day following the administration of TAM, CreERT2 was found to be translocated to the nucleus (Figure 1a). Similarly, in the adult brain, CreERT2 expression was exclusively located in the nucleus of DCX+ cells one day following TAM injection (Figure 1b). Nuclear localization is induced by TAM administration and is a necessary prerequisite for CreERT2 activity [24]."
"To assess the time window during which CreERT2 performs its function in the nucleus following a TAM injection, DCX-CreERT2 adult mice were perfused at different time points post-injection, and the CreERT2 sub-cellular localization was analyzed. The nuclear localization of CreERT2 was substantially reduced after seven days of TAM injection compared to the first day. Even at this point, CreERT2 expression was co-localized with DCX, but its distribution switched back to being largely cytoplasmic (as shown in Figure 1c). In addition, two weeks after the TAM injection, CreERT2 was only found in the cytoplasm (as demonstrated in Figures 1d and 1e). Overall, our results suggest that CreERT2's nuclear localization recedes quickly after the final TAM administration, implying that CreERT2 activity is transient and mostly ceases after seven days.","In order to determine the duration during which CreERT2 operates in the nucleus subsequent to the TAM injection, DCX-CreERT2 adult mice were perfused at various time points after the injection, and the CreERT2 sub-cellular localization was assessed. The CreERT2 nuclear localization was significantly reduced seven days post-TAM injection in comparison to the first day. At this point, CreERT2 expression was still co-localized with DCX, albeit its distribution returned to mostly cytoplasmic (illustrated in Figure 1c). Moreover, after two weeks of TAM injection, CreERT2 was exclusively situated in the cytoplasm (as demonstrated in Figures 1d and 1e). Taken together, our findings suggest that CreERT2 nuclear localization rapidly fades away following the final TAM administration, indicating that CreERT2 activity is transient and essentially stops after seven days.","To determine the time frame during which CreERT2 functions in the nucleus after the TAM injection, DCX-CreERT2 adult mice were perfused at different time points post-injection, and the sub-cellular localization of CreERT2 was evaluated. The localization of CreERT2 in the nucleus was significantly reduced after seven days of TAM injection compared to the first day. At this time point, CreERT2 expression was still co-localized with DCX, but its distribution reverted to being predominantly cytoplasmic (as shown in Figure 1c). Furthermore, after two weeks of TAM injection, CreERT2 was exclusively distributed in the cytoplasm (as demonstrated in Figures 1d and 1e). Overall, our results suggest that the nuclear localization of CreERT2 quickly diminishes following the last TAM administration, indicating that the activity of CreERT2 is transient and virtually ceases after seven days."
"After validating the appropriate co-localization of CreERT2 with DCX+ cells, we assessed the specificity and activity of recombination. In order to achieve this, we crossed DCX-CreERT2 mice with Rosa26 lacZ or CAG-CATEGFP reporter mice, which allowed us to monitor activation of the appropriate reporter gene expression, post-successful excision of the loxP-flanked cassette. The outcome of DCX-expressing cells' destiny could then be monitored based on the expression of the reporter gene at different times following recombination.","Once we had confirmed that CreERT2 was co-localizing correctly with DCX+ cells, we conducted an analysis of the specificity and activity of recombination. To do this, we bred DCX-CreERT2 mice with Rosa26 lacZ or CAG-CATEGFP reporter mice, which enabled us to monitor the activation of the relevant reporter gene expression in the event of successful excision of the loxP-flanked cassette. We could then examine the fate of DCX-expressing cells by analyzing reporter gene expression at various time points subsequent to recombination.","After confirming that CreERT2 was co-localized correctly with DCX+ cells, our next step was to investigate the specificity and activity of recombination. To achieve this, we bred DCX-CreERT2 mice with either Rosa26 lacZ or CAG-CATEGFP reporter mice, which allowed us to monitor the activation of the corresponding reporter gene expression following successful excision of the loxP-flanked cassette. By analyzing reporter gene expression at multiple time points after recombination, we could track the fate of DCX-expressing cells."
"After administering TAM injection on E14.5,to determine CreERT2 activity, X-gal staining revealed that b-gal expression was confined to the development of CNS and DRGs. The same distribution pattern was observed in endogenous DCX expression at this stage. On E17.5, a single TAM-injection resulted in EGFP reporter expression in the majority of brain parenchyma regions, such as dentate gyrus, striatum, cortex, thalamus, Ammon’s horn (CA1), etc., as per the pattern of DCX expression.","The CreERT2 activity during embryonic stages was examined by administering a TAM injection on E14.5. The results of X-gal staining exhibited that b-gal expression was limited to the development of CNS and DRGs. The distribution pattern corresponds to the endogenous DCX expression at this stage, as shown in Figure 2a. After giving a single TAM-injection on E17.5, CreERT2 was activated, leading to EGFP reporter expression distribution throughout different brain parenchymal regions, including dentate gyrus, striatum, cortex, thalamus, Ammon’s horn (CA1), etc. This distribution was also similar to the pattern of DCX expression.","To determine the activity of CreERT2 during embryonic stages, a single TAM injection was administered on E14.5. Results of X-gal staining showed that b-gal expression was confined to the development of CNS and DRGs. The distribution pattern of b-gal expression corresponded to the endogenous expression of DCX at this stage, as shown in Figure 2a. Activation of CreERT2 on E17.5 by a single TAM injection resulted in the widespread distribution of EGFP reporter expression in various brain parenchymal regions, such as dentate gyrus, striatum, cortex, thalamus, Ammon’s horn (CA1), etc., following the pattern of DCX expression. These findings are illustrated in Figure 2d to 2k and Additional file 2."
"After analyzing the data, it was found that virtually every cell expressing EGFP also expressed NeuN, indicating that these cells had progressed into mature neurons (as seen in Figure 2d to 2g). Moreover, the study found that EGFP expression was not detected in DCX-positive cells found in the SVZ (as shown in Figure 2f and 2g), nor in the rostral migrating stream or subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, except for a few EGFP+ cells found in or near the ependymal layer of the lateral ventricles (indicated by arrows in Figure 2f). However, these EGFP+ cells did not have co-expression with NeuN or DCX, and therefore their identity is yet to be determined.","Upon examination, it was discovered that nearly all cells that displayed EGFP also demonstrated NeuN expression, signifying neuronal maturity (depicted in Figure 2d to 2g). In contrast, EGFP expression was not detected among DCX-positive cells located in the SVZ (refer to Figure 2f and 2g), nor in the RMS (data not shown), or the SGZ of the dentate gyrus (as demonstrated in Figure 2d and 2e) with only a small number of EGFP+ cells located within or in close proximity to the ependymal layer of the lateral ventricles appearing (arrows in Figure 2f). Notably, these cells did not show co-expression with either NeuN or DCX, and their classification remains unknown.","The data revealed that almost all EGFP+ cells also exhibited NeuN expression, indicating that these cells had matured into neurons (as depicted in Figure 2d to 2g).

Some EGFP+ cells were present within or close to the ependymal layer of the lateral ventricles (as illustrated by arrows in Figure 2f); however, these EGFP+ cells did not exhibit co-expression with NeuN or DCX, and their classification remains obscure."
"Within the context of exploring the production of neurons in the adult CNS, adult mice were administered TAM injections over five consecutive days before being analyzed four weeks following their last injection. At this point, it was observed that EGFP+ cells that came from SVZ reached the OB, and were mainly distributed in the GrO layer with fewer cells in the pGl layer. Despite expression of NeuN by the EGFP+ cells in the OB, indicating maturity, there was no evidence of co-expression of DCX. The rostral RMS had scattered EGFP+ cells expressing DCX, however, only few EGFP+ cells were found in the SVZ. Likewise, in the dentate gyrus, EGFP+ cells expressed NeuN and not DCX. (Figure 2h–k).","To investigate the production of neurons in the adult CNS, adult mice were injected with TAM for five consecutive days before being analyzed four weeks after the final injection. The results showed that EGFP+ cells generated in the SVZ traveled to the OB and were primarily located in the GrO cell layer, with fewer cells in the pGl layer. The EGFP+ cells located in the OB showed NeuN expression, indicating neuronal maturity, but no expression of DCX was found. In contrast, the rostral RMS had few EGFP+ cells scattered with the expression of DCX. The SVZ had only a small number of EGFP+ cells. Similar to the findings in the OB, EGFP+ cells in the dentate gyrus expressed NeuN and lacked expression of DCX. (Figure 2h–k).","The study aimed to investigate the limited production of neurons in the adult CNS by administering TAM injections to adult mice for five consecutive days and analyzing them four weeks after the last injection. The results showed that EGFP+ cells generated in the SVZ reached the OB and were mainly located in the GrO cell layer, with fewer cells found in the pGl layer. The EGFP+ cells present in the OB expressed NeuN, a marker of neuronal maturity, but not DCX. However, a few scattered EGFP+ cells in the rostral RMS retained expression of DCX, while only rare EGFP+ cells were found in the SVZ. In the dentate gyrus, EGFP+ cells expressed NeuN and was devoid of DCX, similar to the cells detected in the OB. (Figure 2h–k)."
"The efficiency and specificity of recombination events in DCX-expressing cells were assessed in the adult SVZ and SGZ. Efficiency was determined by the proportion of all DCX+ cells that expressed EGFP, while specificity was determined by the percentage of all EGFP+ cells that expressed DCX. To enhance EGFP signals, an anti-EGFP antibody was used in subsequent experiments since initial EGFP levels within cells were relatively low. Following the last TAM injection, about 94% of DCX+ cells expressed EGFP in the SVZ (Figure 3c and 3o). In the SGZ of the dentate gyrus, EGFP was present in approximately 77% of DCX-expressing cells (Figure 3d and 3o). Moreover, co-expression of DCX was observed in about 96% of EGFP+ cells in SVZ and 90% in SGZ (Figure 3p), indicating highly efficient and specific CreERT2 activity.","The effectiveness and specificity of the recombination event in DCX-expressing cells were assessed in the adult SVZ and SGZ. To calculate efficiency, the proportion of DCX+ cells expressing EGFP was determined, while specificity was based on the percentage of EGFP+ cells expressing DCX. Since the level of EGFP within the cells was very low initially, all subsequent experiments used an anti-EGFP antibody to amplify the signals. Following the last TAM injection, approximately 94% of DCX+ cells in the SVZ expressed EGFP (Figure 3c and 3o), while in the SGZ of the dentate gyrus, EGFP was present in approximately 77% of DCX-expressing cells (Figure 3d and 3o). Moreover, approximately 96% of EGFP+ cells in the SVZ and 90% in the SGZ (Figure 3p) co-expressed DCX, demonstrating the highly efficient and specific activity of CreERT2.","In the adult SVZ and SGZ, the efficiency and specificity of recombination events in DCX-expressing cells were measured. Efficiency was determined by calculating the percentage of all DCX+ cells expressing EGFP, while specificity referred to the percentage of all EGFP+ cells expressing DCX. Since the levels of EGFP accumulating within cells were too low initially, an anti-EGFP antibody was used to amplify signals for all subsequent experiments. Two days after the last TAM injection, about 94% of DCX+ cells in the SVZ (Figure 3c and 3o) and approximately 77% in the SGZ of the dentate gyrus expressed EGFP (Figure 3d and 3o). Additionally, approximately 96% of EGFP+ cells in the SVZ and 90% in the SGZ (Figure 3p) co-expressed DCX, indicating the excellent efficiency and specificity of CreERT2 activity."
"To further investigate the kinetics of DCX+ cells' movement from their site of origin to their target structures, the researchers analyzed the distribution of cells that expressed EGFP after recombination at different time points. They sacrificed adult mice on day 8, day 15, and day 29 after the last TAM injection and studied the co-localization of EGFP expression with DCX and NeuN within the SVZ-RMS-OB axis and dentate gyrus.","The distribution of EGFP-expressing cells was analyzed over time to further understand the movement of DCX+ cells from their birthplace to their target structures. The study focused on analyzing the kinetics of these cells and their co-localization with NeuN and DCX within the dentate gyrus and SVZ-RMS-OB axis. For this purpose, adult mice were sacrificed on the eighth, fifteenth, and twenty-ninth day following the last injection of TAM.","In order to gain a better understanding about the process of cells expressing DCX+ leaving their site of birth and arriving at their target structures, the researchers examined the distribution of cells that expressed EGFP following recombination over a period of time. They analyzed the co-localization of DCX and NeuN with EGFP expression in the SVZ-RMS-OB axis and the dentate gyrus on the eighth, fifteenth, and twenty-ninth day after the final TAM injection in adult mice."
"The percentage of EGFP-expressing cells that were DCX-positive in the SGZ decreased from 100% at day 2 to 25% at day 15. Similarly, the percentage of cells that were positive for both EGFP and DCX in the SVZ decreased from 26.7% at day 8 to 12.5% at day 15. By day 29, only a few EGFP-labeled cells expressing DCX were present in the SVZ, and no co-localization between EGFP and DCX was detected in the SGZ. This suggests that the main wave of EGFP-labeled neuron migration left the SVZ within the first 15 days. (Figure 3)","After two days of the last TAM injection, there was a high percentage of EGFP-expressing cells that were also DCX-positive in the SGZ. However, this percentage decreased gradually to approximately 25% of all DCX+ cells by day 15, as shown in Figure 3. Co-localization between EGFP and DCX also decreased from 26.7% at day 8 to 12.5% at day 15 in the SVZ. At day 29, only a few EGFP+ cells expressing DCX were observed in the SVZ, while no co-localization was seen in the SGZ. These findings suggest that the primary migration of EGFP-labeled neurons began within the first 15 days from the SVZ.","The SGZ showed a substantially high percentage of EGFP-expressing DCX+ cells two days after the last TAM injection, which decreased to 41% at day 8 of the experiment, and further declined to around 25% of all DCX+ cells at day 15. Concomitantly, the frequency of co-localization in the SVZ decreased to 26.7% at day 8, and then further declined to 12.5% at day 15. As Figure 3 demonstrates, only isolated EGFP+ cells expressing DCX remained in the SVZ by day 29, whereas there was no co-localization detected in the SGZ at that point. In conclusion, the data indicates that the principal migration of EGFP-labeled neurons took place within the first 15 days, departing from the SVZ."
"The migration of EGFP+ cells from D2 to D15 along the RMS indicated that the cells maintained an immature neuronal morphology and only a few co-localization with NeuN was observed, which was demonstrated in Figure 4. As cells approached the GrO or pGl of the olfactory bulb over a four-week period, there was a general increase in NeuN expression within EGFP+ cells, as presented in Figure 2h and 2i, Figure 4 a, e and 4i. It was found that EGFP+ cells in the GrO region displayed low DCX expression, whereas EGFP+ cells located at the anterior end of the RMS still exhibited strong DCX expression (indicated by the arrow in Figure 2i), indicating that DCX expression decreases gradually as EGFP+ cells migrate into their target regions. Therefore, it was revealed that DCX expression was regionally regulated during the migration of cells towards the olfactory bulb. Similarly, EGFP-expressing cells were observed to be integrated into the inner granular layer of the dentate gyrus over time and gradually induced the expression of NeuN. The results of quantitative analysis indicate that more than 80% of EGFP+ cells in the dentate gyrus (as in Figure 4m) and virtually all EGFP+ cells found in the olfactory bulb expressed the mature neuronal marker NeuN, confirming their neurogenesis.","During their migration along the RMS from D2 to D15, EGFP+ cells were observed to have an immature neuronal morphology and only a few instances of co-localization with NeuN could be seen, as shown in Figure 4. As the cells reached the GrO or pGl of the olfactory bulb over the next four weeks, there was a general increase in NeuN expression within EGFP+ cells, as demonstrated in Figure 2h and 2i, Figure 4 a, e and 4i. Interestingly, EGFP+ cells in the GrO region exhibited only weak expression of DCX, while DCX expression was still strong in the cytoplasm of EGFP+ cells in the anterior end of the RMS, indicating that the expression of DCX gradually decreases as EGFP+ cells migrate towards their target regions (data not presented). Hence, it was revealed that the expression of DCX in cells migrating towards the olfactory bulb is regionally regulated. EGFP+ cells in the dentate gyrus were also observed to integrate into the inner granular layer over time, gradually inducing the expression of NeuN. Quantitative analysis showed that after 15 days of the last TAM administration, more than 80% of EGFP+ cells in the dentate gyrus (as shown in Figure 4m), and virtually all EGFP+ cells in the olfactory bulb expressed the mature neuronal marker NeuN, indicating their neurogenesis.","The migration of EGFP+ cells along the RMS from D2 to D15 exhibited an immature neuronal morphology, with only a few instances of co-localization with NeuN, as illustrated in Figure 4. Following this, as the cells reached the GrO or pGl of the olfactory bulb over the next four weeks, NeuN expression was broadly induced within the EGFP+ cells, as indicated in Figure 2h and 2i, Figure 4a, e and 4i. Conversely, in the GrO, only weak expression of DCX was observed in EGFP+ cells, whereas strong expression of DCX was observed in the cytoplasm of EGFP+ cells located at the anterior end of the RMS (indicated by the arrow in Figure 2i), signifying that the expression of DCX decreases gradually as EGFP+ cells migrate into their target regions. Consequently, it was unveiled that DCX expression in cells migrating to the olfactory bulb is regionally regulated. Similarly, EGFP-expressing cells in the dentate gyrus integrated into the inner granular layer over time and expressed NeuN gradually. According to quantitative analysis, more than 80% of EGFP+ cells detected in the dentate gyrus after 15 days of the last TAM administration (as demonstrated in Figure 4m), and almost all EGFP+ cells found in the olfactory bulb expressed the mature neuronal marker NeuN, verifying their neurogenesis."
"The neuronal phenotypes of EGFP-labeled neurons were further characterized through the use of immunohistology to examine the presence of neurotransmitter-specific markers and calcium-binding proteins on D29 (Figure 5). As demonstrated in earlier investigations (25, 26), EGFP-expressing cells within the OB were able to be detected as expressing GAD65, a commonly found marker in GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, throughout Figure 5, it was discovered that a subset of periglomerular EGFP+ cells exhibited a co-expression of TH, a marker specifically associated with dopaminergic neurons.","Immunohistology was utilized to further characterize the neuronal phenotypes of EGFP-labeled neurons, specifically examining the existence of neurotransmitter-specific markers and calcium-binding proteins at the D29 time point (Figure 5). Consistent with earlier studies (25, 26), GAD65 expression, a marker commonly found in GABAergic neurons, could be detected in EGFP-expressing cells located in the OB. Additionally, periglomerular EGFP+ cells were observed to exhibit a co-expression of TH, a marker specific to dopaminergic neurons (Figure 5).","In order to gain further insight into the neuronal phenotypes of EGFP-labeled neurons, immunohistology was conducted to explore the presence of neurotransmitter-specific markers and calcium-binding proteins on the 29th day (D29) (Figure 5). In agreement with earlier studies (25, 26), the expression of GAD65, found in GABAergic neurons, was present within EGFP-expressing cells located in the OB. Furthermore, a subset of periglomerular EGFP+ cells showed co-expression of TH, a marker specific to dopaminergic neurons (Figure 5), uncovering a unique population of EGFP-labeled neurons."
"VGLUT2 is a commonly used marker for glutamatergic terminations, and at D29, it was observed in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus and surrounded EGFP+ cells. This suggests that glutamatergic inputs were being received by EGFP-expressing cells (as shown in Figure 5). Furthermore, the expression of calcium-binding proteins, calbindin-D28K, calretinin and parvalbumin, was investigated in the EGFP-labeled granule neurons at this time point. Calbindin-D28K was detected in most EGFP+ cells of the dentate gyrus, while no parvalbumin expression and only weak calretinin expression could be observed in EGFP+ cells. Nevertheless, the presence of cells expressing high levels of parvalbumin or calretinin, specifically newly generated granule cells, could be found in the vicinity (as demonstrated by the arrow in Figure 5e).","At D29, EGFP-expressing cells in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus were surrounded by VGLUT2, a marker that is typically utilized to mark glutamatergic terminations. This implies that the EGFP+ cells received glutamatergic inputs (as displayed in Figure 5). Furthermore, at this time point, we examined the EGFP-labeled granule neurons for the presence of calcium-binding proteins, such as calbindin-D28K, calretinin and parvalbumin. Calbindin-D28K could be detected in most EGFP+ cells of the dentate gyrus, while no parvalbumin expression and only weak calretinin expression were evident in EGFP+ cells. However, cells expressing high levels of parvalbumin or calretinin, especially newly generated granule cells, were present in the vicinity (as indicated by the arrow in Figure 5e).","The granular layer of the dentate gyrus showed the presence of VGLUT2, which is a common marker for glutamatergic terminations, and this could be observed surrounding EGFP+ cells at D29.

Moreover, we examined the EGFP-labeled granule neurons to evaluate the expression of calcium-binding proteins, such as calbindin-D28K, calretinin and parvalbumin at this time point. The majority of EGFP+ cells of the dentate gyrus displayed expression of calbindin-D28K, which is typically produced by mature granule neurons. No parvalbumin expression and only weak calretinin expression could be detected in EGFP+ cells. However, cells expressing high levels of parvalbumin or calretinin, specifically newly generated granule cells, were noted in the vicinity (as pointed out by the arrow in Figure 5e)."
"DCX expression is observed in a diverse group of neuronal precursors and young neurons at different stages of maturation and proliferation. To label proliferative cells, BrdU was administered at various time points following recombination. At D2 (the earliest time point), a significant proportion of EGFP+ cells in the SVZ (51.1%) and a smaller proportion in the SGZ (7.7%) incorporated BrdU, indicating continued proliferation. The higher number of actively dividing cells in the SVZ may be attributed to the emigration of post-mitotic young neurons out of the SVZ, leaving immature cells behind. Moreover, while no further BrdU incorporation in EGFP+ cells was observed in SGZ at D15, a few co-labeling BrdU+/EGFP+ cells were seen in RMS, implying that some EGFP+ cells in the SVZ/RMS/OB axis could maintain proliferative capacity until at least D15. This underscores the limited temporal capacity of DCX+ cells.","The population of neuronal precursors and young neurons expressing DCX is relatively diverse, encompassing cells at various maturation stages and degrees of proliferation. BrdU was used to label proliferative cells at different time points after recombination. At D2, approximately 51.1% of EGFP+ cells in the SVZ and only 7.7% of EGFP+ cells in the SGZ incorporated BrdU, indicating that some cells were actively dividing. The higher number of mitotically active cells in the SVZ could be due to young post-mitotic neurons migrating out of the SVZ and leaving immature cells behind. Moreover, while no further BrdU incorporation in EGFP+ cells was observed in SGZ at D15, a few BrdU+/EGFP+ co-labeling cells were observed in RMS, which suggests that some EGFP+ cells in the SVZ/RMS/OB axis may retain proliferative capability until at least D15. Therefore, the proliferative capacity of DCX+ cells is likely limited temporally.","The expression of DCX is observed in a heterogeneous population of neuronal precursors and young neurons across various stages of maturation and proliferation. To label proliferative cells, BrdU was introduced at different time points following recombination. At D2, around 51.1% of EGFP+ cells in the SVZ and only 7.7% of EGFP+ cells in the SGZ incorporated BrdU, suggesting that some cells were still proliferating. The greater representation of mitotically active cells in the SVZ may be attributed to young post-mitotic neurons leaving the SVZ, leaving immature cells behind. Also, while no further BrdU incorporation in EGFP+ cells was detected in SGZ at D15, there were a few BrdU+/EGFP+ co-labeling cells found in RMS (although not shown), inferring that some EGFP+ cells in the SVZ/RMS/OB axis may maintain their ability to proliferate as late as D15. Thus, the proliferative capacity of DCX+ cells appears to be temporally limited."
"After administering TAM to adult mice with DCXCreERT2:CAG-CAT-EGFP, EGFP+ cells were observed outside of the previously identified neurogenic regions. Similar to previous reports in adult rodents, cats, and primates, isolated DCX-expressing cells were observed in the cerebral cortex. To confirm that expression of EGFP in these cells outside of the neurogenic regions was due to DCX activation, the expression pattern of DCX was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in the entire adult brain in relation to EGFP activation.","When TAM was administered to adult DCXCreERT2:CAG-CAT-EGFP mice, EGFP+ cells were detected beyond the known neurogenic regions. Previously, it had been reported that scattered DCX-expressing cells could be found in the adult cerebral cortex of rodents, cats, and primates. To confirm that the EGFP expression in cells outside of the neurogenic regions was indeed due to DCX expression, the expression pattern of DCX throughout the entire adult brain was examined using immunohistochemistry in relation to EGFP activation.","After the administration of TAM to adult mice with DCXCreERT2:CAG-CAT-EGFP, the presence of EGFP+ cells was confirmed in regions beyond the known neurogenic regions. Previous research highlighted the existence of dispersed DCX-expressing cells in the adult cerebral cortex of rodents, cats, and primates. To verify that the expression of EGFP in cells outside of the neurogenic regions was due to DCX expression, the DCX expression pattern in the brain was thoroughly examined using immunohistochemistry in relation to EGFP activation."
"There was a detection of low to moderate DCX expression found among cells dispersed across the cerebral cortex, and weak DCX expression was also visible near the corpus callosum, around the 3rd ventricle and hypothalamus, and in the MCL and GCL of cerebellum (though this data was not shown). After a four-week period following TAM injection, EGFP+ cells were found in those same regions, as shown in Figure 7. Notably, the level of reporter expression was markedly greater than that of endogenous DCX expression, as a strong promoter was used to regulate recombination. The EGFP+ cells discovered outside neurogenic regions were not proliferative, revealing a lack of BrdU labeling, and thus the true identity and destiny of these immature neurons must remain to be fully understood.","Throughout the cerebral cortex, there were scattered cells that displayed a mild to moderate level of DCX expression (`Figure 7`). Additionally, faint DCX expression could be observed in the corpus callosum, as well as around the 3rd ventricle and hypothalamus, the MCL and GCL of cerebellum, but this data was not revealed. Following TAM injection, EGFP+ cells were also found in these particular areas after four weeks (`Figure 7`). However, due to a powerful promoter being employed for recombination, the reporter expression levels were substantially greater than the endogenous DCX expression levels. This was important as it was discovered that the EGFP+ cells situated outside of the neurogenic regions were not proliferative, clearly illustrated by the absence of BrdU incorporation. Therefore, further study is required to identify the nature and future of these immature neurons.","Cells spread across the cerebral cortex displayed low to moderate levels of DCX expression and some weaker DCX expression was also seen in the corpus callosum, 3rd ventricle and hypothalamus, as well as in the MCL and GCL of cerebellum (`data not shown`). After a four-week period of TAM injection, EGFP+ cells were found in these regions (`Figure7`). However, the reporter expression levels were significantly higher when compared to the endogenous DCX expression levels because of the strong promoter being used upon recombination. It is vital to note that the EGFP+ cells located outside the neurogenic regions did not have any proliferative potential, as evidenced by the lack of BrdU incorporation. Therefore, the exact nature and fate of these immature neurons must be further examined."
"We have successfully demonstrated that the utilization of a DCX promoter-driven CreERT2 can efficiently and specifically target recombination in vivo in DCX-expressing cells, particularly in neuronal precursors and young neurons. Our approach surpasses previously generated DCX promoter-driven reporter lines by incorporating the 3’UTR region of the DCX mRNA, which contains post-transcriptional regulation elements of gene expression. Despite no significant differences in CreERT2 expression patterns under the experimental conditions utilized, this construction including the DCX 3'UTR could result in a more accurate CreERT2 expression pattern within the DCX-expressing cell population. Additional research will be required to fully understand its function.","We've demonstrated that recombination can be efficiently and specifically targeted in vivo in DCX-expressing cells through the utilization of CreERT2-mediated recombination. The use of a DCX promoter-driven CreERT2 construct is crucial in this approach, which accurately targets neuronal precursors and young neurons. Unlike previously generated DCX-promoter driven reporter lines, our construct also encodes the 3'UTR region of the DCX mRNA, which contains important post-transcriptional regulation elements of gene expression, and may lead to more accurate CreERT2 expression within the DCX-expressing cell population. While we did not see any significant differences in CreERT2 expression patterns compared to previous lines, further investigation will be necessary to fully understand the role and function of the DCX 3'UTR.","Our report showcases the efficiency and specificity of CreERT2-mediated recombination in vivo in DCX-expressing cells, such as neuronal precursors and young neurons, thanks to a DCX promoter-driven CreERT2 construct. This construct was designed to include the 3’UTR region of the DCX mRNA, which is known to contain post-transcriptional regulation elements of gene expression. While we did not observe any discernible differences in the expression patterns of the CreERT2 transgene under the experimental conditions used, the inclusion of the DCX 3’UTR could lead to a more accurate expression pattern of CreERT2 within the DCX-expressing cell population. Further research is required to understand the exact function and impact of the DCX 3'UTR."
"After administration of TAM, the CreERT2 protein was translocated to the nuclear region of DCX-expressing cells where it facilitated recombination, resulting in rapid activation of reporter expression. Both embryonic and adult CNS showed observable b-gal or EGFP expression one day after tamoxifen injection (Figure 2). Our experimental paradigms exhibited a high efficiency of recombination as demonstrated by 94% of DCX+ cells within the SVZ and 77% of DCX+ cells in the dentate gyrus expressing EGFP after undergoing five daily tamoxifen administrations. Moreover, specificity of recombination activity was confirmed by 96% of EGFP+ cells in SVZ and 90% in SGZ that co-expressed DCX (Figure 3). The study concluded that EGFP+ cells were solely involved in neural development and the absence of DCX expression in a minority of the EGFP+ cells was because of DCX expression downregulation that took place during the 5-day TAM injection period.","Following TAM administration, the CreERT2 protein translocated to the nuclear compartment of DCX-expressing cells, promoting recombination, and leading to a swift activation of reporter expression. One day after tamoxifen injection, b-gal or EGFP expression was noticeable in the embryonic and adult CNS (Figure 2), indicating that our experimental approaches had high recombination efficiency. Our findings showed that 94% of DCX+ cells in the SVZ and 77% of DCX+ cells in the dentate gyrus expressed EGFP after five daily tamoxifen administrations, while 96% of EGFP+ cells in SVZ and 90% in SGZ co-expressed DCX, demonstrating the high specificity of recombination activity (Figure 3). Remarkably, the sole neuronal fate of EGFP+ cells was identified, and it was found that the absence of DCX expression in a small fraction of the EGFP+ cells was associated with the maturation-mediated downregulation of DCX+ during the 5-day TAM injection period.","Once TAM was administered, the CreERT2 protein relocated to the nuclear compartment of DCX-expressing cells which allowed recombination to occur, leading to quick activation of reporter expression. Within a day of tamoxifen injection, b-gal or EGFP could be identified in both the embryonic and adult CNS (Figure 2), denoting that our experimental methods had considerable recombination efficiency. Our study showed that after five daily tamoxifen administrations, 94% of DCX+ cells in SVZ and 77% DCX+ cells in the dentate gyrus induced expression of EGFP, indicating a high efficiency of recombination as per our experimental paradigms. Additionally, 96% of EGFP+ cells in SVZ and 90% in SGZ co-expressed DCX, confirming that our recombination activity was highly specific (Figure 3). Our results showed that the EGFP+ cells were exclusively neuronal, and the absence of DCX expression was observed in only a small fraction of cells, which was attributed to the maturation-associated downregulation of DCX expression over the 5 days of TAM injection."
"The CreERT2 was only temporarily present in the cell nucleus, but the reporter expression was permanently induced following recombination. This allows for the long-term study of the different cell types that arise from DCX+ cells. After one month, the vast majority of the EGFP+ cells in the neurogenic target regions expressed NeuN, indicating that they had matured into neurons. Some of the EGFP+ cells along the neuroblasts' migratory route or localized outside neurogenic regions expressed low levels of DCX. It was found that no EGFP+ cells co-localized with the astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, or microglia markers a month after the last TAM injection. These findings suggest that DCX-expressing cells will inevitably differentiate into neurons under normal conditions. This is in contrast to using the nestin promoter to drive CreERT expression, which resulted in continuous generation of new neurons and glia from the neural stem cell population [17].","While the nuclear translocation of the CreERT2 was transient, the expression of the reporter continued to be induced permanently following recombination, which facilitates the long-term examination of cell types produced from DCX+ cells. After one month of recombination in the DCX-CreERT2, almost all of the EGFP+ cells in the neurogenic target regions exhibited signs of NeuN, which is commonly found in mature neurons. Additionally, a few EGFP+ cells along the migratory path of neuroblasts or outside neurogenic regions expressed a low level of DCX. Importantly, after the last TAM injection, no co-localization was detected between the EGFP signal and markers of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or microglia. This indicates that DCX-expressing cells are committed to neuronal differentiation under normal conditions. This contrasts with the use of the nestin promoter to drive CreERT expression, which generates a continuous flow of new neurons and glia from the neural stem cell population [17].","Upon recombination, the expression of the reporter became permanently induced, even though the nuclear translocation of the CreERT2 was transient. As a result, long-term analysis of the different cell types arising from DCX+ cells is now possible. A month later, the majority of the EGFP+ cells in the neurogenic target regions had matured into neurons that were characterized by NeuN expression. There were a few EGFP+ cells that expressed low levels of DCX and localized either outside neurogenic regions or along the migratory route of neuroblasts. Moreover, there was no co-localization between the EGFP signal and the astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, or microglia markers detected one month after the last TAM injection. These results suggest that under normal circumstances, cells expressing DCX are predetermined to differentiate into neurons. This is in contrast to CreERT expression driven by the nestin promoter, which results in a continuous flow of new neurons and glia generated from the neural stem cell population [17]."
"Calbindin-D28K, calretinin, and parvalbumin are low molecular weight calcium-binding proteins that are found in specific subpopulations of neurons. Calbindin-D28K is present in mature granule cells while calretinin appears in newly generated neurons for a short time. The study observed that EGFP+ granule cells in the dentate gyrus had Calbindin-D28K expression with some low levels of calretinin, and none of them showed parvalbumin expression four weeks after recombination. Further analysis showed no overlap between EGFP and parvalbumin signifying that the GABAergic subpopulation did not replenish with the addition of newly generated neurons in the adult dentate gyrus, although it remains a debated topic.","Calbindin-D28K, calretinin, and parvalbumin are all low molecular weight calcium-binding proteins that are found in distinct neuron subpopulations. Specifically, mature granule cells express Calbindin-D28K while newly generated neurons only transiently express calretinin. The researchers' examination revealed that EGFP+ granular cells located in the dentate gyrus displayed Calbindin-D28K expression, whereas only a few showed low levels of calretinin expression. Notably, none of the cells expressed parvalbumin four weeks after recombination. Moreover, because of the lack of colocalization between EGFP and parvalbumin, there is evidence to suggest that the GABAergic subpopulation in the adult dentate gyrus does not replenish through the continual addition of new neurons, although this phenomenon is a subject of ongoing debate.","Calbindin-D28K, calretinin, and parvalbumin are all members of the low molecular weight calcium-binding protein family and are present in varying subpopulations of neurons. Calbindin-D28K is characteristic of mature granule cells, while calretinin is transiently expressed in newly generated neurons. Within the dentate gyrus, the EGFP+ granular cells expressed Calbindin-D28K, a few of them displayed low calretinin expression, and none of them demonstrated parvalbumin expression four weeks after recombination. The lack of overlap between EGFP and parvalbumin suggests that the GABAergic subpopulation in the adult dentate gyrus is not replenished by the constant addition of new neurons, although the validity of this remains the subject of many debates in the scientific community."
"There were EGFP+ cells discovered in regions of the brain that were not typically related to neuron generation, following recombination in DCX-CreERT mice. In mammals, DCX+ cells have been observed in numerous non-neurogenic parts of the brain such as the temporal and prefrontal cortex layer II, piriform cortex layer III/endopiriform nucleus, corpus callosum, nucleus accumbens, ventromedial striatum, ventrolateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, molecular cell layer, granular cell layer, and white matter of the cerebellum. Superior species of the phylogenetic tree have shown to have a greater occurrence of DCX+ cells; however, it is unclear whether this increase is due to heightened DCX expression levels or greater immunohistochemical detectability [7,8,35-37].","After recombination in DCX-CreERT mice, EGFP+ cells were also found in brain regions that are not typically involved in neuron generation. In mammals, DCX+ cells have been reported in various non-neurogenic areas of the brain, such as the temporal and prefrontal cortex layer II, piriform cortex layer III/endopiriform nucleus, corpus callosum, nucleus accumbens, ventromedial striatum, ventrolateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, molecular cell layer, granular cell layer, and white matter of the cerebellum. The number and distribution of these DCX+ cells appear to rise in more advanced species in the phylogeny, but it is unclear to what extent this is due to an increase in DCX expression levels, leading to better immunohistochemical detectability, or some other factor [7,8,35-37].","In DCX-CreERT mice, EGFP+ cells were observed in brain regions that are not typically related to neuron formation after recombination.

While it has been found that the distribution and frequency of these DCX+ cells are increasing in more advanced species in the phylogenetic tree, it remains to be determined to what extent the increases are due to enhanced DCX expression levels and thus better detectability or other factors [7,8,35-37]."
"The quantity of cells showing EGFP positively in the regions of the 3rd ventricle and hypothalamus was conspicuously greater than the number of cells showing DCX+ in the same areas, which is fascinating. The reason behind this discrepancy could be due to the extremely low level of DCX expression in these cells, making it difficult to detect them using the available antibodies. However, the expression of reporter genes controlled by a powerful constitutive promoter makes it easy to detect targeted cells once DCX-related recombination happens.","Interestingly, the volume of EGFP+ cells detected in the hypothalamus and near the 3rd ventricle was noticeably higher than the quantity of DCX+ cells identified in these areas. The possible reason for this difference is the minimal DCX expression level in these cells, which makes their detection challenging with current antibodies. However, once DCX-related recombination took place, the use of a potent constitutive promoter allows for the straightforward identification of targeted cells through the expression of reporter genes.","It is intriguing to note that the number of EGFP+ cells in the region encompassing the hypothalamus and the 3rd ventricle was remarkably higher than the number of DCX+ cells detected in the same regions. This discrepancy could possibly be due to the very low level of DCX expression in these cells, which makes them almost undetectable using the current antibodies. Conversely, when DCX-associated recombination occurs, the expression of reporter genes becomes under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, leading to an effortless detection of the targeted cells."
"The origin and purpose of DCX-expressing cells beyond the neurogenic regions remain a mystery. However, it has been discovered that neural stem cells can be isolated from nearly all areas within the adult CNS. Moreover, through specific treatment, neurogenic events have been detected in regions such as the cortex, striatum, CA1 area of the hippocampus and even in the white matter. It is tempting to conclude that some of the DCX-expressing cells present in these regions come from a very low-rate continuous neurogenesis. Nonetheless, the absence of BrdU labeling in these cells under normal conditions suggests that this approach of DCX+ cells production would be quite minimal at best.","Investigating the origin and function of DCX-expressing cells outside of the neurogenic regions has yet to be concluded. Studies have found that neural stem cells can be recovered from almost every region of the adult CNS. Also, neurogenic processes have been induced within the adult cortex, striatum, CA1 section of the hippocampus, and even the white matter with specific treatment. There is a possibility that some of the DCX-expressing cells observed in these areas were generated from low-rate continuous neurogenesis. However, due to the lack of BrdU labeling detected in these cells under physiological circumstances, this production may be marginal at best.","The function and origin of DCX-expressing cells that exist outside of the neurogenic regions remain unclear. It has been observed that neural stem cells can be isolated from almost all regions of the adult CNS, and neurogenic events can also be triggered through targeted treatments in areas such as the cortex, striatum, CA1 region of the hippocampus, and even in the white matter. Although some DCX-expressing cells found in these regions may have resulted from low-rate continuous neurogenesis, the lack of BrdU labeling within these cells under normal conditions implies that this mechanism may be marginal in the most favorable scenario."
"The presence of extra-neurogenic DCX-expressing cells is believed to be a result of developmental neurogenesis, where such cells were generated but did not complete their maturation process. Instead, these cells remain as ""quiescent"" local neuronal precursors in the parenchyma. It has also been observed in grafting experiments using neural stem cells that immature neurons remain in the parenchyma, potentially serving as a source of precursor cells for local repair and plasticity. (43, 44)","There is compelling evidence indicating that extra-neurogenic DCX-expressing cells are produced during developmental neurogenesis, but their maturation process is not fully completed, resulting in these cells remaining as ""quiescent"" local neuronal precursors in the parenchyma. Such precursors appear to have been confirmed through grafting experiments where neural stem cells were injected into the ventricles during cortical development. These studies demonstrated that while stem cells integrated into various brain regions as neurons, some cells remained immature neurons in the parenchyma, potentially serving as a store of precursor cells available for local repair or plasticity. (43, 44)","It is suggested by good evidence that extra-neurogenic DCX-expressing cells originate from developmental neurogenesis, but may not undergo complete maturation, resulting in these cells existing as ""quiescent"" local neuronal precursors in the parenchyma. Evidence supporting this view comes from investigations using neural stem cells, which show that some cells remained as immature neurons in the parenchyma after their injection into the ventricles during cortical development. The immature neurons potentially function as a pool of precursor cells available for plasticity or local repair. (43, 44)"
"Another mouse model expressing the DCXCreERT has been recently reported by Cheng et al., which uses a BAC construct to encode the murine DCX promoter. The differences observed between this model and our model, which is based on the human DCX promoter, could be attributed to the latter's potential positional effect of the transgene. Cheng et al.'s model is solely active in DCX-expressing cells within the hippocampus, unlike our mouse model. They have also reported that the induction of their DCXCreERT transgene expression takes place in post-mitotic neuronal precursors. However, since a considerable proportion of all DCX-expressing cells are still in a proliferative state, this indicates a delay in the induction of the transgene expression concerning endogenous DCX. Ultimately, the presented DCX-CreERT mouse model is ideal for studying the maturation and fate of newly generated granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Nonetheless, there remains a lack of models investigating the fate of DCX-expressing cells outside of the dentate gyrus, such as in the subventricular zone (SVZ), which our model can answer.","Researchers recently reported another mouse model that expresses the DCXCreERT, which is different from our model based on the human DCX promoter. Cheng and colleagues used a murine DCX promoter encoded by a BAC construct, which could explain the observed differences between their model and ours. Unlike our model, Cheng et al.'s model is only active in DCX-expressing cells within the hippocampus. Moreover, the authors claim that recombination in their DCX-CreERT mice only occurs in post-mitotic neuronal precursors. This observation implies that the transgene's induction occurs at a later time compared to endogenous DCX, as a significant proportion of DCX-expressing cells are still proliferating. Cheng et al.'s DCX-CreERT mouse model is useful in studying the maturation and destiny of the dentate gyrus's newly generated granule cells. However, there exist no models that address the fate of DCX-expressing cells outside the dentate gyrus, such as those in the subventricular zone, which can be achieved using our model.","Another mouse model expressing the DCXCreERT has been reported, which is different from our model based on the human DCX promoter.

"Despite global efforts to control malaria, the disease remains a significant public health issue, causing almost one million deaths and around 250 million cases every year. The majority of fatalities occur in children under five years old in sub-Saharan Africa. Benin declared malaria as the most critical disease for this age group in 2007, with a significant percentage of medical consultations and hospital admissions attributed to it. The National Malaria Control Programme has implemented recommended prevention and treatment strategies from WHO/GMP, including Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), intermittent preventive treatment (IPT), long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) with carbamate insecticide in specific areas through the President’s Malaria Initiative.","Although there have been significant efforts worldwide to control malaria in the past few years, the disease remains a major public health problem that causes nearly one million deaths and about 250 million cases every year.

"Insecticide treated nets have been proven to decrease uncomplicated malaria episodes by at least 50% in various studies. However, the issue of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors has risen considerably in Africa, especially in Benin. Pyrethroid usage was reduced when applied as either insecticide treated nets or IRS in experimental huts in South Benin due to Anopheles gambiae's resistance to pyrethroids. To handle insecticide resistance, the Centre de Recherche Entomologique de Cotonou (CREC) developed a novel IRM strategy that combines a LLIN and a carbamate treated plastic sheeting in collaboration with the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD) and the NMCP, which has successfully undergone WHOPES phases I and II. As a part of a future community-based evaluation, the malaria burden was assessed in a health district in southern Benin where a nation-wide distribution of LLINs to children below 5 years old had already been carried out in 2007.","It has been demonstrated in numerous studies that insecticide treated nets can reduce uncomplicated malaria episodes by at least 50%. Unfortunately, the prevalence of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors has substantially increased in Africa, particularly in Benin. In South Benin, Anopheles gambiae's resistance to pyrethroids has resulted in reduced efficacy of pyrethroids used as either insecticide treated nets or IRS in experimental huts. To address insecticide resistance, the Centre de Recherche Entomologique de Cotonou (CREC) partnered with the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD) and the NMCP to produce a new insecticide resistance management (IRM) approach that integrates a LLIN and a carbamate-treated plastic sheeting in the same household, which has been effectively evaluated (WHOPES phases I and II). As part of a forthcoming phase III trial, this promising IRM approach is being subject to community-based testing in a southern Benin health district where a countrywide dispersion of LLINs to young children had previously been carried out in 2007.","Studies have shown that the use of insecticide treated nets can lower uncomplicated malaria episodes by up to 50% [6]. However, the increase in insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in Africa, especially in Benin [8-10], is a significant concern. In South Benin, experimental hut studies indicated that pyrethroids' efficacy was reduced when used either in treated nets or IRS due to Anopheles gambiae's resistance to pyrethroids [11, 12].

"A study was conducted to detect malaria cases in a community by conducting active case detection over eight periods of six consecutive days, at six-week intervals throughout the year.

"A study was conducted to examine the epidemiology of malaria in the Ouidah-KpomassèTori Bossito health district after LLINs distribution to children in October 2007. Earlier studies primarily focused on malaria transmission and clinical and parasitological features, both in rural and urban areas of Benin. Other studies have looked at the process indicators for malaria control and the impact of LLIN distribution across Africa. While there is concern regarding pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors in many African countries, there haven't been any reports of LLIN effectiveness being compromised on an operational level.","A prospective longitudinal study was carried out to characterize the malaria epidemiology in the Ouidah-KpomassèTori Bossito health district after the country-wide distribution of LLINs to children in October 2007. Previous literature focused on the malaria transmission as well as the clinical and parasitological aspects of the disease, in both rural and urban areas of Benin. Various authors have also described the process indicators, outcomes, and impacts of malaria control programs, which aided the implementation of the monitoring and evaluation system of ''Roll Back Malaria'' in Benin. Although many studies have investigated the acceptability and population perception of LLINs in Africa, few have explored their parasitological and clinical effects.

"The results of the entomological study depicting the annual EIR in the Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito region suggest that the area is mesoendemic with an average of 5.3 infected bites per annum. The corresponding annual prevalence rate of 21.8% of asymptomatic malaria was observed in young children. The prevalence of the L1014F kdr allele in An. gambiae samples was consistent with previous findings in southern Benin. The age-based increase in the infection rate conforms with the observed pattern in mesoendemic areas. The high infection rate during the dry season may have been influenced by the spike recorded at the end of the rainy season, one month following the nationwide distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs). The parasite density among infected children remained constant across different age groups and seasons, likely attributable to the protection afforded by LLINs. In mesoendemic areas, immunity development against malaria is gradual and reduces parasitaemia with increasing age.","The entomological findings revealed that the Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito health district is mesoendemic, with an average EIR of 5.3 infected bites per year. This was accompanied by a 21.8% annual prevalence rate of asymptomatic malaria in young children. Velema's parasitological observations two decades earlier in the same region had yielded similar results. The L1014F kdr allele frequency was found to be 50%, consistent with earlier research in southern Benin. As is typical of mesoendemic areas, the annual infection rate increased with age. The spike in infection rate during the dry season could be attributed to the peak observed at the end of the rainy season, which occurred only a month after the distribution of LLINs nationwide. The parasite density in infected children remained uniform across all age groups and seasons, likely due to the protection provided by LLINs. In mesoendemic areas, immunity to malaria develops gradually, leading to decreased parasitaemia with increasing age.","The study's entomological data indicated that the Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito area has a mesoendemic status, with an average EIR of 5.3 infected bites per year. This was corroborated by an annual prevalence rate of 21.8% for asymptomatic malaria in young children. The results are consistent with previous parasitological findings from the same region two decades prior. The L1014F kdr allele, which confers resistance to pyrethroids, was present in 50% of An. gambiae samples, aligning with previous studies in southern Benin. The annual infection rate increased progressively with age, as is typical of mesoendemic regions. The dry season's high infection rate may have been influenced by a peak observed at the end of the rainy season, which coincided with the distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) across the country.

"The optimal cutoff value for pyrogenic parasite was identified as 2,000 P. falciparum asexual blood forms per μL through the AF of pathological episodes to malaria. Using AF to define the cut-off value allowed for an improved balance between sensitivity and specificity level. In malaria-endemic areas, the malaria-AF and the appropriate parasite density cutoff to define malaria cases can be influenced by factors such as season and age. However, the present study found that parasite density remained constant regardless of these factors, making the AF a reliable parameter for defining the pyrogenic parasite cutoff in all seasons and age groups. The identified cutoff value is comparable to those found in mesoendemic and hyperendemic areas, further supporting its validity in defining malaria cases.","The ideal pyrogenic parasite cutoff of 2,000 P. falciparum asexual blood forms per μL was determined using the AF of pathological episodes to malaria. Employing AF to define the cutoff value improved the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity level for malaria diagnosis. In areas with stable malaria, factors such as season and age can impact the malaria-AF and consequently the cutoff value for parasite density to define malaria cases. However, this study's findings suggested that parasite density did not vary with age or season. Hence, the AF could be considered the same for all age groups and seasons. The 2,000 cutoff value is similar to those found in mesoendemic areas on children under 3 years and in hyperendemic areas among children aged 0 to 12 years in the south of Benin, further confirming its suitability for diagnosing malaria.","By using the AF of pathological episodes to malaria, a parasite pyrogenic cutoff of 2,000 P. falciparum asexual blood forms per μL was determined to be optimal. The use of AF in defining this cutoff allowed for an improved balance between sensitivity and specificity level for malaria diagnosis. P. falciparum parasitaemia in stable malaria areas is known to be influenced by season and age, which can impact the malaria-AF and therefore the cutoff value for parasite density to diagnose malaria. However, this study found that parasite density did not differ by season or age. As a result, the AF was presumed to be consistent for all age groups and seasons. The identified cutoff of 2,000 was similar to values found in mesoendemic areas among children under 3 years and in hyperendemic areas among children aged 0 to 12 years in southern Benin, further supporting its validity in diagnosing malaria."
"In the health district of Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito, one third of pathological cases were linked to malaria, and to avoid missing cases, the definition for malaria cases considered signs and symptoms of malaria or previous fever within 48 hours of the start of ACD, following the recommendation of McGuinness (33). The mean incidence rate for falciparum clinical malaria was 1.5 cases per child per year. In areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum, the pyrogenic threshold for parasitaemia in people of a given age is similar for all Plasmodium species (56). P. malariae may have been responsible for one clinical case of malaria with 2,360 parasites/μL, while P. ovale may have caused two cases with parasitaemia of 4,800 and 9,800 parasites/μL, respectively, due to the high level of parasitaemia.","Within the Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito health district, malaria was identified as the cause of one-third of all pathology cases, and in order to prevent missed cases, the case definition for malaria included consideration of symptoms indicative of malaria, or fever that had occurred within 48 hours of ACD, as advised by McGuinness (33). The average incidence rate of falciparum clinical malaria per child each year was 1.5. In areas of high-endemicity for P. falciparum, the pyrogenic cut-off for parasitaemia in persons of a specific age is the same across all Plasmodium species (56). Given the elevated parasite density, P. malariae could plausibly have been the cause of one clinical case of malaria displaying 2,360 parasites/μL, with P. ovale potentially causing two instances of high parasitaemia with 4,800 and 9,800 parasites/μL, respectively.","The health district of Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito revealed that malaria was responsible for one-third of all pathological events, and in order to avoid overlooking cases, the definition of malaria cases included signs indicating malaria or a history of fever in the 48 hours preceding the ACD's initial day as recommended by Mcguinness (33). The mean number of falciparum clinical malaria cases per child per year was 1.5. In areas of P. falciparum high-endemicity, the pyrogenic cut-off point for parasitaemia in individuals of a particular age remained uniform across all Plasmodium species (56). Given the significant level of parasite density, one case of malaria with 2,360 parasites/μL may have been attributable to P. malariae, while two instances of malaria with parasitaemia levels of 4,800 and 9,800 parasites/μL, respectively, may be associated with P. ovale."
"Prior to the national distribution of LLINs in 2001, only 4.3% of households in the south of Benin owned treated nets (ITNs), and only 2.4% of children under five slept under them.

"To establish precise quantification of the findings under ideal conditions, it was necessary to use approximately 100 starting template copies, and this determined the LOQ of the assay. When the concentration of template copies fell below 100, the Ct values were beyond the linear range (as demonstrated in Figure 2). Although it was possible to detect the target sequence in all of the amplification reactions with as little as 10 copies present, it was not detectable if only one copy was present (as represented in Figure 3). These outcomes suggest that the LOD value was about 10 copies.","The assay required the use of approximately 100 starting template copies in ideal conditions to produce reliable quantitation of the results, setting the LOQ. Conversely, when the number of copies fell below 100, the Ct values moved out of the linear range, as illustrated in Figure 2. All amplification reactions showed the detection of the target sequence until the copy number reduced to 10, beyond which it was not detectable when only a single copy was present, according to Figure 3.

"As per the reports, PCV2-induced diseases have been found to be causing an increase in the mortality rate of pigs, which can range from 2-3% to 14-30%. Hence, it has become critical for the pig industry and the research community to have quick and sensitive detection and quantitation methods for PCV2. TaqMan real-time PCR is becoming more prevalent due to being highly sensitive and less prone to contamination than conventional PCR. Conventional PCR can give false-positive results when products are examined in gels because of the contamination risk. Real-time PCR is faster and more sensitive than conventional PCR, making it highly beneficial for PCV2 detection.","According to research, PCV2-related diseases lead to an increase in pig mortality of 2-3% up to 14-30%. Due to this alarming statistic, a need has arisen for the pig industry and the research community to have accurate and sensitive detection and quantitation assays for PCV2. Real-time PCR methods using TaqMan technology are becoming the preferred option over conventional PCR techniques since they offer greater sensitivity and are less susceptible to contamination. The main problem with conventional PCR is contamination, which can lead to false positives when examining products in gels. Real-time PCR is a faster, more sensitive approach that requires less time than conventional PCR, and is therefore widely adopted for PCV2 detection.","Reported data shows that PCV2-induced diseases are responsible for 2-3% up to 14-30% mortality rates among pigs. This has created an immediate need for rapid and accurate testing methods to detect and quantify PCV2 in both the pig industry and research community. Compared to conventional PCR, TaqMan real-time PCR is a more sensitive and less susceptible to contamination assay. A primary disadvantage of conventional PCR is that contamination can occur when products are examined in gels, causing false-positive results in subsequent experiments. Conversely, real-time PCR is widely implemented, with increased sensitivity and quicker testing periods than conventional PCR."
"The most appropriate reference fragment to detect PCV2 is located in ORF2 and is known as the major conserved region, as it exhibits the most diversity between PCV1 and PCV2, and there are more sequenced isolates for PCV2 than PCV1. Previous studies have mainly utilized hybridization probes that bind to the target products for PCV2 detection, resulting in high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Various other methods exist for measuring PCV2, including using TaqMan probes, TaqMan real-time PCR, and SYBR Green I, as demonstrated by several researchers in detecting and measuring PCV2 levels in different tissues and serum samples.","Detecting PCV2 requires identifying the major conserved region located in ORF2, which is the most appropriate reference fragment because of the significant diversity it displays between PCV1 and PCV2, along with the availability of sequenced isolates for PCV2 compared to PCV1.

"There are roughly 110 million cases of malaria diagnosed every year in Nigeria, which means that roughly 50% of Nigeria's adult population experiences a malaria episode yearly. Unfortunately, young children may suffer from even more attacks of up to four to five times a year. Moreover, the country endures a vast economic setback due to malaria, estimated to be around 132 billion Naira (equivalent to 878 million USD) in losses annually. Hence, in 1996, the Nigerian authorities came up with their first comprehensive National Malaria Control Policy, followed by instigating the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) initiative in 1999 to tackle this egregious problem.","Nigeria sees around 110 million cases of clinical malaria diagnoses yearly, with almost 50% of adults across the country experiencing at least one episode. For young children, the numbers are higher, with two to four attacks annually. This translates to a significant economic loss for Nigeria, with malaria costing around ~132 billion Naira (close to 878 million USD) annually. To combat this calamity, the Nigerian government finally created its first National Malaria Control Policy in 1996, and Roll Back Malaria (RBM) scheme commenced in 1999.","Nigeria suffers nearly 110 million clinical cases of malaria diagnoses per year, with almost half of the adults experiencing at least one attack annually, while young children have up to two to four bouts of malaria.

"National drug efficacy studies conducted in Nigeria in 2002 revealed that chloroquine and sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) were no more effective as the first-line therapy for malaria. This informed the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in 2005, with artemetherlumefantrine selected as the ideal first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria, with artesunate-amodiaquine (AS + AQ) used as an alternative. Currently, SP is not recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to its increased resistance, which may reach 35%; however, it is still in use for intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) in pregnant women. There is a potential for cross-resistance caused by a similarity in the structure of SP and SMP.","Based on national drug efficacy trials conducted in Nigeria in 2002, it was discovered that chloroquine and sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) were no longer effective as first-line treatments for malaria. In response, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) was introduced in 2005, with artemetherlumefantrine serving as the preferred first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria, and artesunate-amodiaquine (AS + AQ) as an alternative. At present, SP is not used as a treatment for uncomplicated malaria due to its high resistance, which can reach up to 35%. Nonetheless, it continues to be used for intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) in pregnant women.

As a result of the similarity in the structure of SP and SMP, cross-resistance is a possibility."
"Despite the fact that ACT has been in use for several years as a treatment for uncomplicated malaria, its utilization in the field is still below expectations. This is down to poor availability and/or high costs in the African market. The RBM strategy prioritizes the need for malaria patients to access adequate treatment within 24 hours of symptom onset. Any anti-malarial drug intended for home use should be affordable, easy to use, safe, effective and preferably packaged into a single dose. Fixed-dose combinations (FDC) are the preferred treatment option over co-blistered drugs as they prevent inadequate dosing and increase compliance, which ultimately leads to the prevention of drug resistance.","The use of ACT for uncomplicated malaria treatment has been introduced many years ago, but its utilization in the field is still not meeting expectations due to poor availability and/or relatively high costs on the African market. One of the key objectives of the RBM strategy is to ensure that patients suffering from malaria have access to proper and adequate treatment within twenty-four hours of the onset of symptoms. An ideal anti-malarial drug for home use should be safe, effective, affordable, and easy to administer, preferably with a single-dose package.

"The combination of artesunate and sulphamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine (AS + SMP) appears to offer a promising alternative option for treating malaria when first-line drugs are unavailable, given its profile for an ideal antimalarial drug. This drug is safe and easy to administer, with high efficacy rates observed regardless of whether it is administered over a 24- or 48-hour period in various regions [3-5]. Formerly packaged as a co-blistered drug [6,7], it now comes in a fixed-dose combination (FDC), which makes it easy for malaria patients to take (just three tablets). In addition, the SMP element offers secondary advantages due to its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, which could aid in the detection and treatment of illnesses that have been incorrectly diagnosed as malaria [8,9].","When first-line treatments for malaria are not readily available, the combination of artesunate and sulphamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine (AS + SMP) is an intriguing alternative which aligns well with the ideal characteristics of an antimalarial drug. It has a strong safety profile and several studies have shown high efficacy rates when taken over 24 or 48 hours in endemic areas [3-5]. The co-blistered form of the drug was previously offered [6,7], but is now available in a fixed-dose combination (FDC) requiring only three tablets for ease of use by malaria patients. Furthermore, SMP has broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, offering a valuable ancillary benefit in detecting and treating infections that might have been initially misdiagnosed as malaria [8,9].","The AS + SMP (artesunate and sulphamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine) combination is an intriguing alternative for treating malaria when first-line treatments are unavailable, as it appears to meet many of the ideal criteria for an antimalarial drug.

"After assessing the eligibility of the children, they were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. The respective treatments were administered by the recruiting physician at the clinic. One group was given three doses of artesunate/amodiaquine crushed tablets (Amonate®, Dafra Pharma ltd., Kenya) mixed with clean water at 0, 24, and 48 hours. The other group received artesunate/sulphamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine crushed tablets (CoArinate FDC ® Junior, Dafra Pharma Ltd., Kenya) mixed with water and administered at 0, 12, and 24 hours. Depending on their age group, the children were given a full tablet or half a tablet per dose. The patients were monitored for vomiting for 1 hour after receiving the drug. If vomiting occurred within 30 minutes, the full treatment dose was repeated, and half the treatment dose was repeated if vomiting occurred between 30-60 minutes.","Following the initial screening to confirm eligibility, the children were allocated randomly to one of two treatment groups, based on a pre-defined randomization code.

"A number of African countries have implemented artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) as their first-line treatment against uncomplicated malaria, mainly AL and AS + AQ. Nevertheless, taking into account the field occurrences, it is crucial to explore other varieties of ACTs to determine another suitable treatment choice in case those suggested medications are not easily accessible to urgent patients.

"The findings of this study are consistent with previous research on AS + SMP from both malaria-endemic and non-endemic areas [3-7]. Additionally, the AS + AQ cure rate observed in this study is comparable to what other studies have reported [16-18]. Since there were more children under five years old in the AS + AQ group, they may have faced relatively weaker immune systems and thus had a lower ability to clear malaria parasites. Moreover, even though the AS + SMP group experienced more losses to follow-up than the AS + AQ group (21 versus 12), this difference likely arose from changes in school attendance and other social factors as opposed to drug efficacy. The fact that 3,500 children had to be screened to attain the desired sample size of 250 individuals per treatment arm indicates that many fever cases in children may be caused by bacterial infections instead of malaria [9]. Nevertheless, even in cases of misdiagnosis, the SMP component of AS + SMP may still offer clinical advantages to children with bacterial infections based on its antimicrobial effects.","The results of this study are in line with prior investigations conducted on AS + SMP in both malaria-endemic and non-endemic regions [3-7]. Similarly, the cure rate for AS + AQ reported in this study is comparable to that of other studies [16-18]. The notable difference in the age distribution of under-five-year-olds in the AS + AQ group could have contributed to their reduced ability to clear malaria parasites due to their relatively weaker immune systems. Also, while the AS + SMP group had a significantly higher loss-to-follow-up rate than the AS + AQ group (21 versus 12), this difference might not be linked to drug efficacy but to changes in school attendance and family social issues. The need to screen 3,500 children to identify the 250 individuals required for each treatment arm indicates that many fever cases in children could be caused by bacterial infections rather than malaria [9]. Even though there was no parasitological confirmation, the SMP component of AS + SMP would provide clinical benefits to wrongly diagnosed children with bacterial infections based on its antimicrobial properties.","The outcomes of this study are consistent with previous research conducted on AS + SMP in both endemic and non-endemic malaria areas [3-7]. Moreover, the cure rate of AS + AQ observed in this study is similar to that reported in other studies [16-18]. The difference in the proportion of children under five in the AS + AQ group may have contributed to their decreased ability to clear malaria parasites owing to their weaker immunity. Additionally, the AS + SMP group showed a substantially higher loss to follow-up rate than the AS + AQ group (21 versus 12), but this may be attributed to changes in school attendance and other social circumstances as opposed to drug efficacy. The necessity to screen 3,500 children to reach the required sample size of 250 individuals for each treatment group indicates that a significant number of fever cases in children might be caused by bacterial rather than malaria infections [9]. Regardless of the lack of parasitological confirmation, the SMP component of AS + SMP may still provide clinical benefits to children erroneously diagnosed with malaria as it has antimicrobial properties."
"Gametocyte carriage rates were comparable between the two treatment arms both before and after treatment, as artesunate may have been responsible for this outcome. Conversely, sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) treatment was found to elevate gametocyte carriage after resolution of uncomplicated malaria infection, which was not observed with SMP therapy. In addition, Sowunmi et al reported no increase in gametocyte carriage with AQ + SMP treatment despite a slower clearance of the sexual parasitaemia in children in comparison to their AL counterparts.","The rates of gametocyte carriage were similar in both treatment groups before and after treatment, which may be attributed to the efficacy of artesunate. Although sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) treatment is known to increase the carriage of gametocytes post-treatment of uncomplicated malaria infection, this did not turn out to be the case with SMP. In fact, even though AQ + SMP treatment led to a slower clearance of sexual parasitemia in children compared to those on AL treatment, it did not cause an increase in gametocyte carriage according to Sowunmi et al.","Following treatment, the rates of gametocyte carriage were similar between the two groups, which may be attributed to the effectiveness of artesunate. In contrast, sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) therapy was found to increase gametocyte carriage post-treatment of uncomplicated malaria infection, but this was not the case with SMP. Sowunmi et al observed slower clearance of sexual parasitemia in children treated with AQ + SMP and not those treated with AL, although there was no increase in gametocyte carriage with the former."
"The two treatment regimens, AS + SMP and AS + AQ, appeared to be well-tolerated, with no significant difference observed between the frequency of adverse events reported. It was challenging to distinguish adverse events from symptoms associated with malaria. The incidence of itching in patients treated with AS + AQ was found to be low, similar to what had been reported in previous studies. None of the children reported any severe adverse events such as icterus or intravascular haemolysis. However, patients treated with AS + SMP had a significantly lower packed cell volume during follow-up, possibly due to the high frequency of G6PD deficiency in the study area. A comprehensive screening for G6PD deficiency in all patients could have verified this finding.","Both AS + SMP and AS + AQ treatments were well-tolerated, and the incidence of adverse events reported was similar in the two groups. Since the symptoms of malaria often overlap with adverse events, it was difficult to differentiate the two. Notably, the occurrence of itching in patients treated with AS + AQ was low, which was consistent with the findings of an earlier study. None of the children reported any serious adverse events such as icterus or intravascular haemolysis. However, patients treated with AS + SMP had a lower packed cell volume during follow-up, which might be due to the high incidence of glucose six phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in the area. To confirm this observation, screening for G6PD deficiency would have been necessary for all patients.","The study found no significant difference in the frequency of adverse events between both AS + SMP and AS + AQ treatments. However, distinguishing between adverse events and malaria-related symptoms was a challenge. It is worth mentioning that the occurrence of itching was infrequent among patients treated with AS + AQ, which is consistent with the results of a prior study. None of the children who participated in the study reported severe adverse events such as icterus or intravascular haemolysis. Still, a decrease in packed cell volume was observed in patients treated with AS + SMP during follow-up. This finding may relate to a high prevalence of G6PD deficiency prevalent in the study's geographical location; thus, screening all patients for G6PD deficiency would have substantiated this conclusion."
"In conclusion, the study demonstrates that AS + SMP FDC administered thrice within a 24-hour period with 12-hour intervals is equally as effective as AS + AQ FDC administered thrice within a 48-hour period with 24-hour intervals in fever and parasite eradication for children in Nigeria suffering from uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Both drugs are proven safe, although AS + SMP has a higher chance of re-infection. AS + SMP is a viable substitute to recommended first-line treatments in locations where it is not available, or the cost is too high. However, cross-resistance between SP and SMP could happen, so progress monitoring of drug resistance is essential.","The study's findings indicate that for children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Nigeria, administering AS + SMP FDC in three doses within 24 hours (with a 12-hour interval) is just as effective as giving AS + AQ FDC in three doses within 48 hours (with a 24-hour interval). Both drugs have demonstrated safety, with AS + SMP showing slightly higher re-infection rates. AS + SMP can be a good alternative to standard first-line treatments in areas where they are unavailable or too costly. However, potential cross-resistance between SP and SMP necessitates ongoing surveillance of drug resistance.","In essence, the study reveals that AS + SMP FDC, given as three doses over 24 hours with 12-hour intervals, is just as effective as AS + AQ FDC, given as three doses over 48 hours with 24-hour intervals, for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children in Nigeria when it comes to fever reduction and parasite eradication. Both drugs have a proven track record of safety, but AS + SMP has a higher risk of re-infection. AS + SMP may be a valuable replacement for first-line treatments in areas where accessibility and affordability remain a challenge. However, because of potential cross-resistance between SP and SMP, continuous monitoring for the development of drug resistance is critical."
"Chronic depression is a significant problem in public health around the world. Although there are medications available for depression, they come with severe side effects, and not all patients respond well to them, leaving them in an unsatisfactory state. The cause of depression is not entirely comprehended, leading to the inability to create powerful drug treatment. However, existing research has confirmed a probable interaction between immunological transformations and major depression. When rodents are injected with certain pro-inflammatory cytokines or bacteria, they exhibit sickness behavior, leading to depressive behavior, including decreased food intake, social isolation, circadian rhythms, and movement.","Chronic depression poses a major public health challenge across the globe. Although there are multiple drugs available for the treatment of depression, they often cause significant side effects, and some patients do not respond satisfactorily to them. Due to an incomplete understanding of the etiology of depression, developing more effective medications is challenging. Nevertheless, recent literature indicates that there is a correlation between changes in the immune system and severe depression. Studies have revealed that when given some pro-inflammatory cytokines or bacterial products, rodents undergo sickness behavior that is followed by depressive behavior, accompanied by reduced food intake, social isolation, alters in the circadian cycle, and immobility.","Chronic depression is a global public health concern. While multiple depression treatments exist, they may come with significant side effects, and some patients may not respond satisfactorily to the available therapies. A lack of complete understanding of depression's causes refrains from developing more effective treatments. However, literature provides evidence of connectivity between major depression and immunological changes. Some bacterial products or pro-inflammatory cytokines act systemically, causing sickness behavior with characteristics like reduced food intake, circadian disturbances, social isolation, and reduced mobility in rodents. These changes progress to depressive behavior."
"Toll-like receptors (TLR) perform the function of recognizing microbial structures, where TLR4 is mostly signaled by Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), leading to the activation of different intracellular routes [6]. Research has proved that cytokine production plays an essential role in LPS-induced depression-like behavior in rodents, and depressed patients exhibit a high level of cytokine plasma [2,3]. Besides, in rats, TLR activation due to infection results in systemic inflammation and signs of brain-controlled sickness [7,8].","Toll-like receptors (TLRs) act as recognition units that distinguish different microbial structures. Among these receptors, TLR4 is commonly activated by Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), leading to intracellular pathway activation [6]. Studies have demonstrated that LPS causes depression-like behavior in rodents, which relies on cytokine production. Interestingly, elevated cytokine plasma levels have also been observed in patients with depression [2,3]. Additionally, recent research has revealed that TLR activation caused by infection can result in systemic inflammation and show signs of brain-controlled sickness in rats [7,8].","Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are responsible for identifying microbial structures, with TLR4 particularly affected by Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and triggering the activation of various intracellular pathways [6].

Furthermore, research has revealed that TLR activation due to infection can induce systemic inflammation and manifest brain-controlled illness in rats [7,8]."
"Kinins are a group of peptides that are produced quickly in response to different stimuli. Upon release, they activate two receptors known as B1 and B2, which are coupled to G proteins. B2 receptors are present in many tissues, while B1 receptors are usually not expressed under normal conditions but are rapidly increased after infection, trauma, or cytokine exposure. TNFa plays a critical role in inducing kinin B1 receptors, as demonstrated by previous research. Therefore, B1 receptors may be activated under specific pathological conditions, playing a role in various chronic pain and inflammatory processes.","Kinins are a type of peptides that are quickly produced in response to a variety of stimuli. These peptides then activate two G protein-coupled receptors called B1 and B2. B2 receptors are found in several tissues, while B1 receptors are not usually expressed under normal conditions but are upregulated rapidly after infection, trauma, or cytokine exposure. Studies have shown that the upregulation of kinin B1 receptors is influenced by TNFa. Thus, B1 receptors are likely to be induced in specific pathological situations and might be involved in a range of chronic inflammatory and painful diseases.","Kinins are peptides that are generated in response to different stimuli.

Notably, TNFa is an important factor in activating kinin B1 receptors, as evidenced by previous studies. As a result, B1 receptors are more likely to be expressed in certain pathological conditions and may be implicated in various chronic inflammatory and pain pathologies."
"Based on previous studies, cytokine production resulting from E. coli or P. gingivalis can cause an increase in kinin B1 receptor expression in animals models of peripheral inflammation [14,15,18]. Recent research has suggested that kinin B1 receptors might also play a role in CNS diseases like epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and neuropathic pain [19-21]. To investigate whether B1 receptor participation contributes to depression-like behavior following systemic administration of E. coli LPS in mice that have undergone swimming as a stressor, we conducted this study. This experimental approach is based on the concept that internal and external stressors can interact to cause a general illness state leading to allostatic overload [2,22,23]. Biochemical and molecular techniques like flow cytometry, ELISA, and real-time PCR were utilized to understand some of the factors responsible for B1 receptor induction in depressed LPS-treated animals, and immunohistochemical investigations were used to explore the impact of kinin B1 receptor antagonism on glial activity.","Prior investigations have exhibited that animal models of peripheral inflammation showed a marked increase in the kinin B1 receptor expression following cytokine production by either P. gingivalis or E. coli [14,15,18].

"The results presented in Figure 1a illustrate that, in mice, the administration of E. coli LPS (450 μg/kg, i.p.) systemically, following a 5-minute session of forced swimming, led to depression-like behavior. The tail-suspension paradigm showed the increase in immobility time in animals treated with LPS to be statistically significant at 24 hours (P < 0.01), with a return to baseline at 48 hours (P < 0.05), but not at 6 hours (P > 0.05). As expected, imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), a typical antidepressant drug, resulted in a substantial decrease in the immobility time (47 ± 16% of reduction; Figure 1a) when given 30 minutes before the behavioral evaluation. Interestingly, the depression-like behavior brought about by LPS was significantly inhibited with the help of i.p. treatment of selective B1 receptor antagonists, such as R-715 (0.5 mg/kg, 30 min), SSR240612 (5 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min), or oral administration of SSR240612 (10 mg/kg, 1 h), suggesting that B1 receptor antagonists may play a role in the treatment of depression. However, in our model, the selective kinin B2 receptor antagonist FR173657 (30 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min) failed to produce a significant change in the immobility time (P > 0.05; Figure 1b).","In Figure 1a, the results indicate that mice exhibited depression-like behavior after receiving E. coli LPS (450 μg/kg, i.p.) systemically, following a 5-minute forced swimming session.

"Despite extensive research on the impact of LPS treatment on rodents, the effects of administering E. coli LPS to mice that have been subjected to forced swimming have been shown to produce classical CNS-associated effects (as described in references [3-5]). Our results also support this notion, demonstrating a significant reduction in body temperature (as indicated in Figure 1e) and locomotor activity in open-field arena tests. These effects were most pronounced six hours after LPS administration but had largely subsided after 24 hours (as shown in Figure 1f). While administering R-175 (at 0.5mg/kg) 30 minutes prior to testing had no significant impact on body temperature after six hours, we continued our experiments using SSR240612 as it has good oral bioavailability.","Our research builds on existing studies that have investigated the effects of LPS treatment on rodents. Our findings support previous literature, demonstrating that administering E. coli LPS to mice previously subjected to forced swimming can result in CNS-associated changes, including a marked decrease in body temperature and locomotor activity. In particular, locomotor activity was significantly reduced at six hours after LPS administration (with levels returning to baseline at 24 hours), and body temperature was significantly reduced at the six-hour mark (with no significant change observed at 24 hours). Interestingly, administering R-715 (at 0.5mg/kg) 30 minutes beforehand did not have a significant impact on body temperature at the six-hour mark.

"B1 receptor expression in CNS structures and its correlation with the impact of selective kinin B1 receptor antagonists were investigated. Mice were subjected to a session of forced swimming and then LPS administration (450 μg/kg, i.p.). B1 receptor mRNA expression was measured in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. The findings from quantitative real-time experiments revealed a significant time-dependent increase in B1 receptor mRNA levels in the hippocampus, which peaked at 1 h (about 2.5-fold increase) (Figure 2a), and a considerable 40-fold increase in the cortex 1 h after LPS treatment (Figure 2b).","In order to determine whether the influence of selective kinin B1 receptor antagonists was connected to changes in B1 receptor expression in CNS structures, B1 receptor mRNA expression levels were examined in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice that were exposed to forced swimming and LPS administration.

Quantitative real-time experiments revealed that B1 receptor mRNA levels rose significantly over time, reaching a maximum peak in the hippocampus at 1 h (about 2.5-fold increase) (Figure 2a). Moreover, in the cortex, this increase was almost 40-fold 1 h after LPS treatment (Figure 2b)."
"Figure 3 demonstrates that administering LPS treatment following forced swimming caused a remarkable upsurge in CD68 immunoreactivity in the mouse hippocampus. This indicates that glial cell activation increases under these conditions. Interestingly, CD68 labeling was largely suppressed by pre-treating animals with SSR240612, a selective kinin B1 receptor antagonist (5 mg/kg, i.p.), 30 minutes before LPS, while imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) had no such effect. These findings suggest that imipramine and kinin B1 receptor antagonist operate via different mechanisms to exert their antidepressant-like effects. In many cases, reduced expression of neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF, has been linked to depression. Our study showed that BDNF expression in the mouse hippocampus significantly decreased at both the 6- and 24-hour time points following our depression protocol, with levels dropping by approximately 50%. However, pre-treating animals with SSR240612 (5 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 minutes before LPS treatment did not significantly affect this variable, as shown in Figure 4.","As Figure 3 demonstrates, there was a marked increase in CD68 immunoreactivity in the mouse hippocampus when LPS treatment followed forced swimming, indicating activation of glial cells. Notably, pre-treatment with SSR240612 (5 mg/kg, i.p.), a selective antagonist of the kinin B1 receptor, 30 minutes before LPS administration, almost completely suppressed CD68 labeling, while imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) had no observable effect. These findings suggest that imipramine and kinin B1 receptor antagonist act via different mechanisms to produce antidepressant-like effects.

"The researchers aimed to establish a correlation between the changes caused by LPS and cytokine production. To accomplish this, they evaluated the levels of TNFa in the entire brain or mouse serum. The mice were subjected to forced swimming and injected with E. coli LPS, leading to a considerable, gradual increase in TNFa production in the brain and serum. The TNFa levels peaked in serum between 1 and 3 hours, displaying a 90-fold increase, and returned to regular levels after six hours. In contrast, in the brain, the TNFa levels reached their maximum values between 3 and 6 hours after LPS injection, with an 1.8-fold augmentation, decreasing to control levels after 12 hours. The researchers also studied cytokine content in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of LPS-treated mice, using flow cytometry analysis. The results revealed that CSF cytokines IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-g were not detected in the system. IL-12's concentration was similar to that observed in naïve animals. Notably, CSF TNFa levels showed a 340 and 90-fold increase, peaking one hour after LPS injection and remaining elevated for three more hours.","The primary objective of the study was to establish a relationship between the changes induced by LPS and cytokine production. To achieve this, the researchers analyzed TNFa levels in the entire brain or mouse serum. Mice were made to swim forcefully and then given E. coli LPS, which resulted in an evident and gradual increase in TNFa production in the brain and serum. TNFa levels peaked between 1 and 3 hours in serum, indicating a 90-fold increase, and returned to normal after six hours. In comparison, the TNFa levels found in the brain increased to their maximum between 3 and 6 hours after LPS injection, displaying a 1.8-fold increase and returning to control levels after 12 hours.

"In order to investigate the role of TNFa in depression-like behavior, we utilized TNFa p55 receptor deficient mice. Previous literature data had suggested a close relationship between TNFa and B1 receptor upregulation. The C57/BL6 mouse strain was used as they were inbred with TNFa p55 receptor knockout animals. In this study, a dose of 1000 μg/kg of E. coli LPS was needed to induce a significant increase in immobility time in the tail-suspension test in C57/BL6 mice which was comparable to the 450 μg/kg dose in CF1 mice. Upon treatment with forced swimming plus LPS (1000 μg/kg, i.p.), the depression-like behavior was significantly reduced in mice that were genetically deficient in TNFa p55 receptors compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, the increase of B1 receptor mRNA expression in mice subjected to forced swimming plus LPS was absent in TNFa p55 receptor knockout animals.","The role of TNFa in depression-like behavior was further explored in this study since previous literature data show that TNFa and B1 receptor upregulation are closely related. To achieve this, TNFa p55 receptor-deficient mice were utilized. Inbred C57/BL6 mice were used since they were already TNFa p55 receptor knockout animals. A dose of 1000 μg/kg of E. coli LPS was required to cause a significant increase in immobility time in the tail-suspension test in C57/BL6 mice, which corresponded to a 1.5-fold increase compared to saline-treated animals as seen in CF1 mice given a 450 μg/kg dose. When mice were administered forced swimming plus LPS, the depression-like behavior was almost non-existent in mice lacking TNFa p55 receptors unlike wild-type mice. Moreover, there was no increase in the expression of B1 receptor mRNA in TNFa p55 receptor-deficient mice subjected to forced swimming plus LPS, unlike those with the receptor.","The study aimed to examine the role of TNFa in the observed depression-like behavior using previous findings that showed a connection between TNFa and B1 receptor upregulation. Utilizing TNFa p55 receptor-deficient mice, the researchers looked to establish the importance of TNFa in the observed depression and used C57/BL6 mice, which are inbred with TNFa p55 receptor knockout animals. It was established that a 1000 μg/kg dose of E. coli LPS was required to cause a significant increase in immobility time in mice subjected to the tail-suspension test, similar to the level seen in CF1 mice given a 450 μg/kg dose. The depression-like behavior induced by forced swimming plus LPS decreased significantly in the absence of TNFa p55 receptors. Moreover, TNFa p55 receptor knockout animals showed no increase in B1 receptor mRNA expression following forced swimming plus LPS treatment."
"During the past few years, there have been significant developments in our comprehension of the genetic, biochemical, and immunological changes associated with depression. Recent research has highlighted certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1b, and TNFa, as crucial molecules contributing to depression-related behaviors following infection. These cytokines may help to coordinate the body's local and systemic responses to pathogens. In a study involving mice, administration of LPS after a brief swimming session resulted in earlier signs of sickness behavior, including reduced body temperature and locomotor activity, six hours post-LPS, followed by later signs of depression-like behavior, such as increased immobility time in the tail suspension test, 24 hours post-LPS. This supports previous studies that suggest sickness behavior is a normal initial response to infectious stimuli, but depression-like states may persist even after the sickness has resolved initially.","Over the last few years, significant strides have been made in understanding the genetic, biochemical, and immunological changes associated with depression. Studies have identified specific pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, IL-1b, and TNFa, as central players in depression-related behaviors following infection. These cytokines are believed to be responsible for coordinating responses to pathogens on both a local and systemic level. In an experiment using mice, researchers found that administering LPS after a short swimming session resulted in earlier signs of sickness behavior, such as reduced body temperature and locomotor activity, six hours after LPS injection, followed by later depression-like behavior, evidenced by an increase in immobility time in the tail suspension test, 24 hours post-LPS. This result is consistent with previous findings that suggest sickness behavior is an expected initial response to infectious agents, but depression-like states may persist long after any accompanying sickness has subsided.","In the last few years, there have been significant advances in our comprehension of the genetic, biochemical, and immunological modifications pertinent to depression. According to research, certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, IL-1b, and TNFa, play an essential role in depression-related behaviors subsequent to infection. These cytokines are thought to manage the body's response to pathogens locally and systemically. In a study on mice, administration of LPS after a brief swimming session caused reduced body temperature and locomotor activity, 6 hours after LPS injection, indicating signs of sickness behavior followed by an increase in immobility time in the tail suspension test, demonstrating depression-like behavior post-LPS 24 hours after injection. Such results are in accord with prior literature that suggests sickness behavior is an ordinary initial response to infectious stimuli, but depression-like states may remain even after recovery from sickness behavior."
"There is currently no previous study that has established a correlation between depression and kinin B1 receptors. These receptors are typically not present in the peripheral nervous system under normal circumstances but are rapidly up-regulated in response to stressful stimuli. Interestingly, they are found in certain areas of the brain and spinal cord such as the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and choroid plexus epithelial cells. While it is not fully understood what exact role kinins play in the brain, the presence of B1 receptors in the nervous system suggests a potential central role for them. This research aims to investigate if B1 receptors might be involved in the development of depression-like behavior caused by pre-stressful stimuli and LPS.","To our knowledge, there have been no studies investigating the possible correlation between depression and kinin B1 receptors.

"The results of the study revealed that the antidepressant imipramine was effective in reducing the depression-like state observed in the tail suspension test in stressed rodents. Moreover, treatment with either selective B1 receptor antagonists R-715 or SSR240612 significantly inhibited the increased immobility, indicating the relevant role of B1 receptors in depression-like behavior. The study also found marked increase in B1 receptor mRNA expression in the hippocampus and cortex of mice that were subjected to forced swimming plus LPS administration. These findings suggest that infection associated with a stressful stimulus may up-regulate B1 receptors in the CNS, leading to depressive behavior, and highlights the significant role of alterations in hippocampal plasticity in depression. In addition, our study did not find any significant effect of the selective B2 receptor antagonist FR173657 on immobility time in the depression paradigm, which is in line with the proposed physiological roles of kinin B 2 receptors.","The study showed that the antidepressant imipramine was successful in reducing the depression-like state observed in the tail suspension test in stressed rodents.

Real-time PCR experiments conducted as part of the study showed a significant increase in B1 receptor mRNA expression in the hippocampus and cortex of mice that underwent forced swimming plus LPS administration. This study's results indicate that infection related to a stressful stimulus may increase B1 receptor activity in the CNS, contributing to depressive behavior. The study also found evidence that changes in hippocampal plasticity contribute to depression. The study found no significant impact of the selective B2 receptor antagonist FR173657 on immobility time in the depression paradigm.

"Upon considering the functional data obtained from the tail suspension test and the anhedonia paradigm of sucrose intake, SSR240612 was found to significantly reverse reduced sucrose consumption in LPS-treated mice. This is noteworthy as depression is often accompanied by anhedonic states where pleasure sensations are decreased or missing. Furthermore, it was found that Swiss mice who underwent stressful forced swimming and LPS administration experienced a significant decline in sucrose consumption, but this symptom was reversed by the antidepressant imipramine, thus affirming the validity of the experiment. On the other hand, the administration of the B1 receptor antagonist R-715 had no significant effect on sickness behavior-induced hypothermia, indicating that blocking B1 receptors can reverse later depression-like symptoms without interfering with early sickness behavior, which is primarily coordinated by cytokines.","The results of the anhedonia paradigm of sucrose intake, in addition to the functional data obtained from the tail suspension test, showed that SSR240612 reversed the reduced sucrose consumption in LPS-treated mice. Given that depression often results in anhedonic states where pleasure sensations are reduced, this finding is significant. The experiment also discovered that Swiss mice experienced a significant decline in sucrose consumption due to stressful forced swimming and LPS administration, which was reversed by the antidepressant imipramine. This confirms the reliability of the experiment. Furthermore, the B1 receptor antagonist R-715 did not significantly affect sickness behavior-induced hypothermia. This suggests that blocking B1 receptors can alleviate later depression-like symptoms without interfering with the early sickness behavior, which is primarily coordinated by cytokines.","By utilizing the anhedonia paradigm of sucrose intake alongside functional data obtained from the tail suspension test, results have shown that SSR240612 can entirely reverse reduced sucrose consumption in LPS-treated mice. This finding is noteworthy as depression often results in anhedonic states where pleasure sensations are reduced or even missing. Additionally, the experiment revealed that Swiss mice subjected to  stressful forced swimming plus LPS administration experienced a considerable decrease in sucrose consumption, but this symptom was reversed through the use of the antidepressant imipramine, effectively reinforcing the experiment's validity. Conversely, administering the B1 receptor antagonist R-715 did not lead to significant changes in sickness behavior-induced hypothermia. This suggests that blocking B1 receptors can reverse later depression-like symptoms without interfering with the early sickness behaviour, mainly coordinated by cytokines."
"The immune-competent components of the CNS that play a crucial role in depression pathogenesis include microglia and astrocytes [43, 47, 48]. Our study found that following forced swimming and LPS treatment, there was activation of microglia in mice, as indicated by an increase in CD-68 immunostaining in the hippocampus after 24 hours of LPS injection, once B1 mRNA levels returned to baseline. Activated microglia release neurotoxic mediators such as pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to various injuries [3,49]. Our data reveal that the selective non-peptide B1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 significantly curtailed CD-68 immunopositivity, indicating an inhibition in microglial activation. However, imipramine did not significantly alter this parameter. Therefore, it can be deduced that microglial activation inhibition is linked with the antidepressant-like effects of B1 receptor antagonists, not those caused by imipramine. These findings offer valuable insights into understanding depressive states associated with infections.","Microglia and astrocytes are major immunocompetent components of the CNS that are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of depression [43, 47, 48]. Our study demonstrated that forced swimming and LPS treatment led to the activation of microglia in mice. This was evidenced by an increase in CD-68 immunostaining in the hippocampus at 24 hours post-LPS injection, which coincided with the return of B1 mRNA levels to baseline. Upon injury, activated microglia are known to release neurotoxic mediators such as pro-inflammatory cytokines [3, 49]. Our findings indicate that the selective non-peptide B1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 had a significant impact on reducing CD-68 immunopositivity, while imipramine did not. Hence, we propose that the antidepressant-like effects of B1 receptor antagonists are related to the inhibition of microglial activation and not to imipramine's effects. These results are worthy of attention and may help us understand depressive states, especially those associated with infections.","The CNS's major immunocompetent constituents that likely play a role in depression pathogenesis are astrocytes and microglia [43, 47, 48]. Our study uncovered that forced swimming followed by LPS administration caused microglia activation in mice, which was evident from the increased CD-68 immunostaining in the hippocampus 24 hours after LPS injection, corresponding with B1 mRNA levels returning to normal. Microglial activation in response to injury is recognized to prompt the release of neurotoxic mediators, including pro-inflammatory cytokines [3, 49]. Notably, our data suggests that the selective non-peptide B1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 effectively curbs CD-68 immunopositivity, whereas imipramine did not. Therefore, B1 receptor antagonist antidepressant-like effects, but not those resulting from imipramine, may be related to microglial activation inhibition. These results are significant and may pave the way for understanding depressive states, particularly those linked with infections."
"Depression is associated with changes in synaptic plasticity that result in decreased BDNF function and other biochemical alterations. Under stressful conditions, the BDNF gene can be repressed, leading to neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus. Interestingly, animal models have shown that BDNF infusion in certain brain regions can have antidepressant-like effects. Most monoaminergic antidepressant drugs can restore normal BDNF transcriptional levels. In our depression model, there was a sustained reduction in BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus for up to 24 hours. The selective B1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 did not significantly change BDNF mRNA expression, despite preventing microglial activation. This suggests that SSR240612 appears to have an antidepressant-like effect through a different mechanism than most antidepressants, acting primarily through an inflammatory pathway rather than affecting BDNF.","Changes in synaptic plasticity that lead to decreased BDNF function and other biochemical alterations are closely linked with depression. Stressful conditions can suppress the BDNF gene, which results in neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus. Intriguingly, animal models have indicated that administering BDNF to specific brain regions can have antidepressant-like effects. Additionally, most monoaminergic antidepressant medications can return BDNF transcriptional levels to normal. Our depression model showed that BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus sustained a reduction for up to 24 hours. Notably, though SSR240612, the selective B1 receptor antagonist, prevented microglial activation, it did not significantly alter BDNF mRNA expression. SSR240612's antidepressant-like activity, therefore, appears to operate through a different inflammatory pathway than those of typical antidepressants and not via BDNF interference.","Depression is associated with changes in synaptic plasticity, which lead to decreased BDNF function and other biochemical changes.

"Pro-inflammatory cytokines are a key factor in the pathogenesis of depression, as directly stated above. The expression of soluble TNFa receptors in individuals with major depressive disorder is particularly high. Using TNFa antagonists to treat patients leads to a reduction in depressive symptoms and an improvement in quality of life. These findings are reinforced by this study, which shows that LPS administration in pre-stressed mice leads to a significant increase in TNFa levels in serum, CSF, and whole brain. Serum TNFa levels are responsible for sickness behavioral changes, while the increase in TNFa levels in the brain causes depression-like behavior. TNFa levels in CSF also showed a marked increase.","It is well-established that pro-inflammatory cytokines play a significant role in the pathogenesis of depression. Patients with major depressive disorder show a higher expression of soluble TNFa receptors, and treatment with TNFa antagonists leads to improvements in depressive symptoms and overall quality of life. This study further supports this hypothesis by demonstrating that LPS administration in pre-stressed mice results in a notable increase in TNFa levels in serum, CSF, and whole brain. The TNFa production initially increases in serum and then in the brain. The study suggests that the increased TNFa levels in serum contribute to sickness behaviors such as hypothermia and reduced locomotor activity, while the elevated TNFa levels in the brain may be responsible for depression-like behaviors. Additionally, TNFa levels in CSF showed a marked increase between 1-3 hours.","As mentioned earlier, pro-inflammatory cytokines are heavily involved in the development of depression. Surprisingly, patients who have major depressive disorder showed an increase in the expression of soluble TNFa receptors. Patients who were treated with TNFa antagonists showed a boost in life quality and also an improvement in depressive symptoms. This study proves the hypothesis by displaying how LPS administration escalates the level of TNFa in serum, CSF, and the whole brain of pre-stressed mice. The production of TNFa was initially enhanced in the serum between 1-3 hours and in the whole brain between 3-6 hours. The finding suggests that the increase of TNFa levels in the serum leads to sickness-like behavioral changes such as low body temperature and decreased locomotor activity while its enhancement in the brain engenders depression-like behavior. Furthermore, there was a marked increase in TNFa levels in CSF collected from LPS-treated mice between 1 and 3 hours, while other cytokine levels remained constant."
"The presence of TNFa in the CSF suggests that there is a way for the brain to communicate with the immune system. When the toll-like receptors on the macrophage-like cells in the circumventricular receptors are activated, they release proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFa. However, because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is relatively impermeable to cytokines, it is unclear how circulating cytokines might affect brain function. Cytokines could potentially enter the brain through volume diffusion or through areas where the BBB is compromised, such as during stressful or immunologically-challenging events, according to a commonly-accepted theory. Moreover, kinins can cause problems for the BBB, which would disrupt its functioning and lead to a variety of neurological conditions, such as depression, which are linked to the entry of cytokines into the brain.","The fact that TNFa is present in the CSF supports the idea that there is a communication pathway between the immune system and the brain. When macrophage-like cells in the circumventricular receptors receive signals from toll-like receptors, it triggers the release of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFa [3]. However, since the BBB is relatively impermeable to cytokines, it remains unclear how circulating cytokines might affect brain function, even though the circumventricular organs lie outside the BBB. One theory suggests that cytokines may be able to pass through the BBB via volume diffusion [3, 58] and by penetrating sites where the BBB is somewhat compromised. Stressful events or immunologic challenges like those used in our protocol may cause the BBB to become compromised, allowing cytokines to enter the brain [34]. Kinnins can also disrupt the BBB, leading to neurological conditions related to cytokine entrance into the brain, such as depression [59,60].","The presence of TNFa in the CSF seems to indicate that there is communication between the brain and immune system. Macrophage-like cells in the circumventricular receptors produce proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFa, when their toll-like receptors are stimulated [3]. Since the BBB is relatively impermeable to cytokines, it is still uncertain how circulating cytokines might affect brain function, even though the circumventricular organs lie outside the BBB. One theory suggests that cytokines may be able to enter the brain via volume diffusion [3,58]. Additionally, they may be able to cross the BBB in areas that are somewhat compromised due to stressful events or immunologic challenges, such as those used in our protocol [34]. Kinins can cause the BBB to dysfunction, further leading to various neurological conditions relating to cytokine-entry into the brain, such as depression [59,60]."
"After employing TNFa p55 receptor-KO mice, we gained further insights into the relevance of TNFα in our experimental paradigm. Our research indicated that the depression-like behavior and upregulation of B1 receptors, which were induced by forced swimming plus LPS treatment, were substantially eliminated in the mice lacking TNFα p55 receptors. Our group had already established the importance of TNFα in B1 receptors upregulation [14-17]. Thus, our experimental evidence explicitly suggests a link between the TNFα cytokine and kinin B1 receptor upregulation in depression genesis. Additionally, our data provide strong evidence that pro-inflammatory cytokine generation plays a pivotal role in B1 receptor upregulation induced by LPS, as we had already demonstrated [14].","Using TNFa p55 receptor-KO mice, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the relevance of TNFa in our experimental model.

Our group had already established the significance of TNFa in the upregulation of B1 receptors [14-17]. Our experimental findings imply a possible link between the TNFa cytokine and kinin B1 receptor upregulation in the genesis of depression. We also present strong evidence that generating the pro-inflammatory cytokine might be critical in inducing B1 receptor upregulation by LPS, as we had demonstrated previously [14].","In our experimental paradigm, we utilized TNFa p55 receptor-KO mice to determine the relevance of TNFa.

Our previous studies had already established the importance of TNFa in B1 receptor upregulation [14-17]. The present study adds to our understanding by showing a clear association between the TNFα cytokine and kinin B1 receptor upregulation in depression genesis. Additionally, our data suggests that LPS-induced upregulation of B1 receptors may depend critically on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα, as we had previously demonstrated [14]."
"It is widely accepted among experts that depression should be viewed as a syndrome rather than a disease. Current research suggests a link between depression and the immune system, with cytokines and other immune mediators acting as ""sensor"" molecules to transform noncognitive stimuli into cognitive stimuli recognized by the central nervous system. Peripheral inflammatory events may impact central factors and behavior, and the participation of kinin B1 receptors in depressive alterations may be associated with microglial activation and production of TNFa in the brain.

"Type I interferons (IFNs) have a crucial role in the innate immune response, as well as in the induction of adaptive immunity against viral infections. When the body encounters a viral infection, it triggers the production of type I IFNs (IFN-a/b) [1, 2]. These type I IFNs are responsible for activating hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that encode antiviral proteins and cytokines, providing the host with protection against further viral infections [3, 4].","Type I interferons (IFNs) have a vital function in both the innate immune response and the development of adaptive immunity in response to viral infections. When the body detects a viral infection, it triggers the production of type I IFNs (IFN-a/b) [1, 2].

"The main viral sensors in most mammal cells are RNA helicases, RIG-I, and MDA-5. RIG-l and MDA-5 recognized viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), respectively. TLR3 can also recognize viral dsRNA in most cells.

"Though host cells have evolved several types of cellular signalling to identify and combat viral infection, most viruses have the ability to thwart these immune defenses to a certain extent [7,11]. Many viruses, such as those that have discovered how to block IFN synthesis or meddle with the functions of IFN, for example, have developed various tactics to evade the IFN reaction [12].","Despite the range of cellular signalling mechanisms that have evolved in host cells to detect and respond to viral infection, most viruses possess mechanisms to avoid these host immune responses in different ways [7,11].

"The ability of influenza A viruses to resist interferon (IFN) is linked with the non-structural gene (NS) [13-16]. Recent studies have shown that the NS gene responsible for influenza A viruses contains two proteins. These proteins are produced through the translation of unspliced mRNA, which creates a 26 kDa protein termed non-structural protein 1 (NS1). On the other hand, a nuclear export protein of 14 kDa (NEP), earlier known as NS2, develops by the translation of spliced mRNA [18].","The viral anti-IFN activities demonstrated by influenza A viruses are attributed to the NS gene [13-16].

"The NS1 protein works against the initiation of IFN-b [19,20] and negatively impacts the capability of a variety of IFN-triggered proteins that prevent virus growth in the body, including protein kinase R (PKR) and 2’-5’oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) [21-23].","The NS1 protein antagonizes both the production of IFN-b [19,20] and the efficiency of many IFN-activated proteins that possess antiviral properties, namely protein kinase R (PKR) and 2’-5’oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) [21-23].","The NS1 protein thwarts the induction of IFN-b [19,20] and the function of numerous antiviral IFN-stimulated proteins, including protein kinase R (PKR) and 2’-5’oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) [21-23]."
"The NS gene is divided into two gene pools, referred to as alleles A and B [24,25]. NS1 proteins between allele A and B have a nucleotide identity of 63-68% and an amino acid identity of 66-70%. Allele A is more prevalent and is the only subtype found in strains adapted to mammals. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of avian allele A and B viruses with that of human viruses revealed six amino acid motifs between human and avian allele A viruses and 35 motifs between human and allele B viruses, implying that allele B viruses are less similar to mammalian-origin viruses [26].

"It has been previously discovered that differences in the NS1 protein of H10 avian influenza viruses are linked to their pathogenicity in minks (Mustela vison).

We observed that both NS1s caused a significant suppressive effect on luciferase activity. However, ""mink/84"" appeared to be more potent, with an average decrease of 6.8 folds (85.3%) in A549 cells (Figure 1A), while ""chicken/49"" caused an average decline of 20.8% in A549 cells.","We conducted an analysis to investigate the ability of NS1 derived from ""mink/84"" and ""chicken/49"" to inhibit the induction of transcription of the IFN-b gene. To do so, we utilized the ISRE-Luciferase and Poly I:C stimulation model system, which depends on the expression of IFN and subsequent signaling from the IFN-a/b receptor, resulting in ISRE reporter gene expression. Our findings show that both NS1s displayed a significant suppressive impact on luciferase activity, but the impact of ""mink/84"" was considerably stronger, causing an average 6.8-fold decline (85.3%) in A549 cells (Figure 1A), while ""chicken/49"" induced an average decline of 20.8% in A549 cells.","In this study, we assessed the capacity of NS1 from ""mink/84"" and ""chicken/49"" to hinder the initiation of transcription of the IFN-b gene.

Our results demonstrated that both NS1s caused a significant suppressive effect on the luciferase activity. Nonetheless, ""mink/84"" appeared to be much more potent, resulting in an average decline of 6.8 folds (85.3%) in A549 cells (Figure 1A), whereas ""chicken/49"" resulted in an average decline of 20.8% in A549 cells."
"The western blot analysis was performed to ascertain whether the variance in IFN-b promoter inhibition was due to insufficient expression or a difference in NS1 proteins in A549 cells. The expression level of NS1 proteins was confirmed by lysing the cells at 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours post-transfection and conducting Western blotting. The results indicated that both the 'mink/84' and 'chicken/49' constructs expressed NS1 proteins in high quantity, and there was no notable difference between the two constructs in terms of allele A and allele B NS1 protein levels (Figure 1B). The expressed proteins from both constructs were also homogenously accumulated in A549 cells (Figure 1B). Thus, the discrepancy in IFN-b induction in the presence of allele B NS1 protein was not due to differences in the protein's expression or accumulation in the cells.","In order to determine whether the IFNb promoter's inhibition difference was caused by insufficient expression or variation in the NS1 proteins in A549 cells, the researchers conducted western blot analysis to validate the expressed NS1 proteins' level. The cells were lysed at different time intervals following transfection (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours), and western blotting was carried out. The results showed that the NS1 proteins from both ""mink/84"" and ""chicken/49"" constructs were highly expressed, with comparable levels of allele A and allele B NS1 protein (Figure 1B). The western blotting further revealed that there was homogenous accumulation of the expressed protein from both constructs in A549 cells, with no noticeable dissimilarity between alleles in terms of NS1 production (Figure 1B). Hence, the findings indicated that the discrepancy in IFN-b induction in the presence of allele B NS1 protein was not due to a difference in NS1 protein expression and accumulation in the cells.","In order to establish whether the disparity in IFNb promoter inhibition was due to insufficient expression or differentiation in NS1 proteins in A549 cells, the researchers used western blot analysis to affirm the level of expressed NS1 proteins.

The results indicated that both the 'mink/84' and 'chicken/49' constructs expressed NS1 proteins in high quantities, with a similar level of allele A and allele B NS1 proteins (Figure 1B). The western blotting also demonstrated that the expressed protein from both constructs were evenly accumulated in A549 cells, with no significant dissimilarity between alleles in terms of NS1 protein production (Figure 1B). The results suggested that the difference in IFN-b induction in the presence of allele B NS1 protein was not due to a variation in NS1 protein expression and accumulation in the cells."
"It was ambiguous whether the obtained result was caused by differences in the ability to suppress the production of IFN or the influence on the ISRE transcription signaling pathway or both. To clarify this, measurement of IFN protein production was conducted using ELISA.","It was unclear whether the outcome was the result of variations in the capability to downregulate IFN production, or if the signaling pathway, which leads to ISRE transcription, was affected, or both. To resolve this question, an ELISA was used to measure IFN protein production.","It was uncertain whether the observed result corresponds to differences in the ability to reduce IFN production, the influence on the ISRE transcription signaling pathway, or both. To disentangle this, an ELISA was carried out to measure the production of IFN protein."
"The production of IFN-b protein, after being stimulated by poly I:C, was detected in the cell medium of control cells following a delay of 2 to 4 hours. The IFN-b levels escalated linearly in the cell culture supernatant, and the highest levels were attained 16 to 24 hours after stimulation (Figure 2A). Although cells transfected with different NS1s produced low levels of IFN-b, there were significant variations between the NS1s. Mink/84 virus NS1-protein-expressing cells were not as good at producing IFN-b, with levels secreted being at least 10 times lower than those of control cells in the cell culture supernatant. In these cells, IFN-b secretion reached the maximum yield 8 hours post-stimulation, and then the levels declined rapidly for the remaining experiment period. The NS1 protein of chicken/49-expressing cells produced lower IFN-b levels, but the profile was comparable to that of the control cells (Figure 2A). Therefore, it was inferred that NS1 in this system suppresses IFN protein production rather than IFN receptor signalling.","The control cells showed detection of the IFN-b protein in the cell medium 2 to 4 hours after the stimulation of poly I:C, followed by a linear increase of IFNb in the cell culture supernatant. The highest yield values were recorded 16 to 24 hours post-stimulation (Figure 2A). Despite low levels being secreted by the cells transfected with different NS1s, significant differences were seen among them. IFN-b secretion was considerably weaker in cells that expressed the NS1 protein of the ""mink/84"" virus. The levels detected in the cell culture supernatant were at least 10 times lower in comparison to the control cells. The maximum peak yield for IFN-b secretion was seen 8 hours after the stimulation, which quickly dropped down to low levels for the remainder of the experiment. On the contrary, the NS1 protein of ""chicken/49"" expressing cells were better at producing IFN-b, with similar profiles as the control cells but lower levels (Figure 2A). These results indicate that the NS1 protein suppresses IFN protein production rather than signalling from the IFN receptor in this system.","Detection of the IFN-b protein in the cell medium of control cells occurred between 2 to 4 hours after stimulation by poly I:C. A subsequent linear increase of IFNb in the cell culture supernatant led to peak levels being attained 16 to 24 hours post-stimulation (Figure 2A). While the cells transfected with various NS1s produced low levels of IFN-b, significant differences were observed within these NS1s. ""Mink/84"" virus NS1 protein-expressing cells showed weak production of IFN-b, with secreted levels being at least 10 times lower in comparison to the control cells in the cell culture supernatant. In these cells, the peak yield for IFN-b secretion was reached 8 hours after the stimulation, and then it decreased rapidly for the remainder of the study. On the other hand, cells expressing the NS1 protein of ""chicken/49"" were better at producing IFN-b but had a lower profile compared to the control cells (Figure 2A). Therefore, it is concluded that NS1 protein in this system suppresses IFN protein production rather than signalling from the IFN receptor."
"In order to investigate whether the decrease in IFN-b production occurred due to the inhibition of IFN-b gene expression, we conducted a comparison of the gene expression kinetics in A549 cells which were exposed to poly I:C in the presence or absence of various NS1 proteins.","To determine whether the suppression of IFN-b production was a result of the inhibition of the IFN-b gene expression, we analyzed the gene expression kinetics of A549 cells that were stimulated with poly I:C in the presence or absence of different NS1 proteins.","In order to ascertain whether the decline in IFN-b production was due to the dampening of the IFN-b gene expression, we compared the gene expression kinetics of A549 cells stimulated with poly I:C in the presence or absence of various NS1 proteins."
"The experiment showed that the IFN-b mRNA levels increased throughout the experiment in the control cells shown in Figure 2B, which was also observed in cells expressing the NS gene of ""chicken/49"" in Figure 2C. The cells in the control group showed a significant increase in transcript levels 2 to 4 hours after stimulation, reaching a plateau by the end of the experiment. Figure 2D demonstrated that the NS1 protein of ""mink/84"" effectively suppressed IFN-b gene transcription 4 hours after stimulation in A549 cells. Additionally, the activation of the IFN-b gene expression in cells expressing the NS gene of ""chicken/49"" resulted in increased levels of IFN-b mRNA, following a pattern similar to that of the control cells.","Figures 2B and 2C indicated an increase in IFN-b mRNA levels in the control cells and cells expressing the NS gene of ""chicken/49,"" respectively, throughout the experiment. Within the control cells, there was a significant rise in transcript levels 2 to 4 hours post-stimulation, which then leveled off by the end of the experiment. The NS1 protein of ""mink/84"" was shown in Figure 2D to powerfully suppress IFN-b gene transcription in A549 cells 4 hours following stimulation. On the other hand, the transfection of plasmids containing the NS gene of ""chicken/49"" and the resultant activation of the IFN-b gene expression led to increased levels of IFN-b mRNA, indicating a comparable trend to that of the control cells.","The experiment's outcomes demonstrated increasing levels of IFN-b mRNA in the control cells shown in Figure 2B and those expressing the NS gene of ""chicken/49"" as per Figure 2C throughout the study period. The transcript levels in the control cells showed a significant increase between 2 and 4 hours with the plateau attained by the end of the experiment. The NS1 protein of ""mink/84"" suppressed IFN-b gene transcription effectively in A549 cells four hours after stimulation, as shown in Figure 2D. Furthermore, the activation of the IFN-b gene expression in cells that had transfected plasmids carrying the NS gene of ""chicken/49"" caused an increase in the IFN-b mRNA levels, maintaining the same rising trend as that seen in the control cells."
"The NS1 protein of ""mink/84"" effectively inhibits the transcription of the IFN-b gene in stimulated A549 cells, as confirmed by the RT-PCR analysis of the INF-b mRNA. This suggests that the primary target of the NS1 protein in ""mink/84"" is to minimize the expression of IFN. The same analysis was done in A549 cells expressing NS1 of ""chicken/49,"" and the results were comparable.","According to the RT-PCR analysis of the INF-b mRNA, the NS1 protein in ""mink/84"" successfully repressed the transcription of the IFN-b gene in A549 cells that were stimulated. This implies that the primary objective of the ""mink/84"" NS1 protein is to inhibit the induction of IFN. The study also indicated that A549 cells expressing NS1 of ""chicken/49"" exhibit the same response to stimulation, as seen in the RT-PCR analysis of INF-b mRNA.",The RT-PCR examination of INF-b mRNA expressed in stimulated A549 cells with NS1 from “mink/84” or “chicken/49” demonstrated the effectiveness of the NS1 protein in "mink/84" in suppressing the transcription of IFN-b gene in the cells. This infers that the fundamental activity of the NS1 protein in "mink/84" is to hinder the initiation of IFN. The results of the study prove that A549 cells expressing NS1 of "chicken/49" also experienced the same degree of repression in response to stimulation.
"Influenza A viruses employ a key strategy to avoid triggering the host's immune response. They do this by restraining IFN-a/b expression or signalling between cells. Such signalling would otherwise stimulate transcription from genes that contain an ISRE promoter. Thus, virus-infected cells are not induced into an antiviral state. To achieve this goal, the viral protein NS1 plays a major role in regulating innate immunity. NS1 contains a C-terminal effector domain and an N-terminal RNA binding domain. The effector domain interacts with proteins that process cellular mRNA, such as the mRNA export machinery and components of the nuclear pore complex. This results in inhibition of mRNA export and pre-mRNA splicing of host cell transcripts. Meanwhile, the RNA binding domain binds to both single- and double-stranded RNA. This binding inhibits signalling and activation of various antiviral proteins, such as RIG-I, PKR, OAS/RNase L, activators of transcription factors, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and those involved in type I IFN and inflammatory cytokine signalling.","The influenza A virus has a primary tactic to evade the host's immune response by impeding the IFN-a/b expression or signalling between nearby cells. The reason is to stop antiviral activity that may be stimulated by transcription from the ISRE promoter-containing genes. The NS1 viral protein plays a significant part in modulating innate immunity by suppressing the host's immune responses through its two functional domains: the RNA binding domain and an effector domain. The effector domain interacts with proteins that engage in mRNA processing, suppressing mRNA export and pre-mRNA splicing of host cell transcripts, and interacting with constituents of the nuclear pore complex and mRNA export machinery. Simultaneously, the RNA binding domain binds single- and double-stranded RNA, inhibiting the activation and signalling of antiviral proteins, transcription factors controlling type I IFN and inflammatory cytokine signalling, as well as activating mitogen-activated protein kinase.","To avoid the host immune response, one of the primary strategies used by influenza A viruses is to impede IFN-a/b expression or signalling between neighbouring cells, as it may trigger antiviral activity generated by transcription from ISRE promoter-containing genes. Innate immunity is mainly regulated by the NS1 viral protein, which inhibits host immune responses via its two distinct functional domains - the RNA binding domain and effector domain. The effector domain interacts with proteins required for cellular mRNA processing, thereby inhibiting the export of mRNA and pre-mRNA splicing of host cell transcripts, and interacts with the nuclear pore complex and mRNA export machinery. Whereas, the RNA binding domain binds to single and double-stranded RNA, thereby inhibiting the activation and signalling of antiviral proteins, mitogen-activated protein kinase, transcription factors involved in type I IFN, inflammatory cytokine signalling, as well as RIG-I, PKR, and OAS/RNase L activators."
"Our previous study had concluded that the NS1 protein is a potential crucial factor in the various pathogenicity levels exhibited by H10 avian influenza viruses in mink.

These viruses contained different NS alleles, one from A (""mink/84"") and the other from B (""chicken/49""). An analysis of the anticipated amino acid sequences of both NS1 proteins revealed that there were 71 amino acid differences (in Figure 3).

"The NS1 proteins of ""mink/84"" and ""chicken/49"" were almost identical except for one difference: the CPSF30 interaction site. This specific site plays an important role in NS1's ability to interact with the 30kDa subunit of CPSF, which inhibits 3'-end processing of cellular premRNA. The NS1 protein's function is regulated by two domains, one located around residue 186 and another around residues 103 and 106. The NS1 protein of ""mink/84"" contained Glu186, Phe103, and Met106, whereas the NS1 protein of ""chicken/49"" had Tyr103. Changing these interaction sites could have a significant impact on how NS1 controls the expression of host genes, as evidenced by a prior study.","The NS1 proteins of ""mink/84"" and ""chicken/49"" were practically indistinguishable, except for a single difference observed in the CPSF30 subunit interaction site. This site is integral to the NS1 protein's capacity to interact with CPSF30, which, in turn, inhibits 3'-end processing of cellular premRNA. There are two domains implicated in this function, the first surrounding residue 186 and the second around residues 103 and 106. The NS1 protein of ""mink/84"" had Glu186, Phe103, and Met106 while the NS1 protein of ""chicken/49"" had Tyr103.

"MOLT-4 cells exposed to compound 1i at 10.0 and 16.7 μM for 24 hours resulted in an increase in the sub-G1 fraction, indicating activation of cell death pathways. The higher concentration had a more pronounced effect.

This finding suggests that compound 1i induces apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis also revealed an increase in the S and G2/M phases. The increase in S phase fraction could be due to DNA synthesis stimulation or delay in cell movement from S to G2/M phase. The increase in G2/M fraction implies that daughter cells are delayed in exiting the mitotic cycle, leading to reduced tumor cell number due to delayed cell turnover.","Upon exposure to compound 1i for 24 hours, MOLT-4 cells at 10.0 and 16.7 μM showed an increase in sub-G1 fraction, suggesting an upregulation of cell death machinery.

"Treatment of MOLT-4 cells with compound 1i resulted in a significant increase in both caspase-3 and caspase-6 activities, indicating the occurrence of cell death through the apoptotic pathway. The highest up-regulation of caspase-3 was observed at 5.0 μM concentration, 12 hours following treatment, while the peak of caspase-6 activity was observed at the same concentration 24 hours after treatment.

"I will rewrite a paragraph that is similar in meaning to the original paragraph given. MOLT-4 cells were subjected to compound 1i at concentrations of 5 and 10 μM, and their morphology was examined using light microscopy at various time intervals. With an increase in the concentration of the compound and a longer incubation period, the number of cells undergoing apoptosis also increased. Following 36 hours of incubation with a 10 μM concentration of compound 1i, characteristic features of apoptotic cells such as the marginalization of chromatin material, cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation/fragmentation, and the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles were observed (Figure 6b), which are considered hallmarks of apoptosis. On the other hand, the control cells exhibited larger sized nuclei with nucleoli (Figure 6a).","I will rewrite the given paragraph, retaining its original meaning. MOLT-4 cells were treated with compound 1i at 5 and 10 μM concentrations, and their morphology was analyzed through light microscopy at several time intervals. The frequency of apoptotic cells increased with higher dosages of the compound and more extended incubation times. An image of cells exposed to a 10 μM concentration of compound 1i for 36 hours (Figure 6b) demonstrated apoptotic features, including chromatin marginalization, cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation/fragmentation, and vacuolation of the cytoplasm, which are regarded as indicators of apoptosis.

At a concentration of 10 μM after 36 hours of incubation, the characteristic signs of apoptosis had developed (as shown in Figure 6b) such as chromatin marginalization, cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation/fragmentation, and cytoplasmic vacuole formation.

"Based on the results of transmission electron microscopy, MOLT-4 control cells showed a high nucleocytoplasmic ratio, finely dispersed chromatin in the nucleus, and visible nuclear pores. Most of these cells also exhibited noticeable nucleoli, and variously sized and shaped mitochondria with cristae, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes. However, treatment with 10 μM of compound 1i for 36 hours led to a significant reduction in rough endoplasmic reticulum and damaged mitochondrial cristae, indicating the initiation of apoptosis. There was no evidence of a necrotic event, as there were no inflammatory changes in the nuclei and cytoplasm and no incident of plasma membrane breakage. Additionally, vacuolization was found in the treated cells, which corroborated previous observations presented in the literature [16, 17].","In the context of transmission electron microscopy, MOLT-4 control cells stood out due to their high nucleocytoplasmic ratio, finely dispersed chromatin in the nucleus, and visible nuclear pores.

Conversely, treatment with 10 μM of compound 1i for 36 hours led to significantly reduced rough endoplasmic reticulum, and numerous damaged mitochondrial cristae, which hinted at the early stages of apoptosis. Fortunately, there was no evidence of necrosis, as there was no inflammatory changes in either the nuclei or the cytoplasm of the treated cells, and there was no plasma membrane breakage. Ultimately, this research builds on what was previously documented, with the treated cells also showing distinct vacuolization in agreement with similar studies[16, 17].","Using transmission electron microscopy, the MOLT-4 control cells appeared quite different with their high nucleocytoplasmic ratio, visible nuclear pores, and nuclear chromatin that dispersed finely.

On the other hand, treating MOLT-4 cells with 10 μM of compound 1i for 36 hours adversely affected their rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial cristae, pointing towards apoptotic changes. This study did not show evidence of necrosis, with no indications of inflammatory changes in the nuclei and cytoplasm or any damage in the plasma membrane, which ruled out the possibility of necrosis. Instead, the treated cells displayed distinctive vacuolization, which is supported by similar observations made in previous literature [16, 17]."

Exposure of the tumor cells to test compounds at a concentration of 8 μM resulted in a gradual and significant inhibition of 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine incorporation, similar to that of mitonafide at the same concentration. After 1 hour of incubation, compound 1d and 1i reduced 3H-thymidine incorporation by 96% and 95% respectively, compared to mitonafide which caused a 95% reduction. The compounds demonstrated significant inhibitory effects on DNA synthesis, while the inhibition of RNA synthesis was less pronounced. Mitonafide, compound 1d, and 1i led to 92%, 94%, and 89% inhibition of 3H-uridine incorporation, respectively (Figure 8).","In an attempt to determine whether compound 1d and 1i could inhibit tumor growth by affecting nucleic acid synthesis, studies were performed to investigate their similarities in structure to mitonafide.

Over a 60 minute period, untreated cancer cells displayed a linear pattern of 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine incorporation. However, when exposed to the test compounds at a concentration of 8 μM, a gradual and significant reduction in 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine incorporation comparable to that of mitonafide was observed. After 1 hour of exposure, compound 1d and 1i inhibited 3H-thymidine incorporation by 96% and 95%, respectively, compared to a 95% reduction by mitonafide. These compounds showed remarkable inhibitory effects on DNA synthesis, but RNA synthesis inhibition was less outstanding. Mitonafide, compound 1d, and 1i achieved 92%, 94%, and 89% inhibition of 3H-uridine incorporation respectively (Figure 8).","To determine whether compound 1d and 1i could inhibit tumor growth by interfering with nucleic acid synthesis, scientists conducted experiments to investigate their structural similarities to mitonafide.

The untreated cancer cells showed a linear pattern of 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine incorporation over 60 minutes. Nonetheless, upon exposure to the test compounds at an 8 μM concentration, there was a gradual and considerable decline in 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine incorporation comparable to that of mitonafide under the same concentration. After an hour of treatment, compound 1d and 1i were able to inhibit 3H-thymidine incorporation by 96% and 95%, respectively, while mitonafide exposure led to a 95% reduction.

"The significance of the nature and position of a substituent on a molecule's antitumor property has been established in research. This study focused on substituted N-(hydroxyalkyl)naphthalimide and considered five different substituents (R = H, 6-Br, 6-Cl, 6-NO2, 5-NO2) within the aromatic ring portion of the compound. The outcome showed that the antitumor activity was mainly exercised through the 6-NO2 substituent, which is consistent with prior findings on other (chloroalkyl) naphthalimide compounds, where 6-nitro-2-(3-chloropropyl) naphthalimide was the most potent antitumor agent in that series. [7].","The antitumor property of a molecule is dependent on the nature and location of a substituent, according to previous research.

"Compound 1i displayed significant antitumor activity, and it had an impact on the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle in MOLT-4 cells. During the S phase of the cell cycle, a cell prepares for cell division by duplicating its DNA. The results of flow cytometric measurements indicated that compound 1i prevented the S phase, which is essential for DNA duplication in tumor cells before mitosis. In S-180 cells, compound 1i inhibited 3 H-thymidine incorporation into DNA, which confirmed this possibility, evidencing suppression of DNA synthesis. Additionally, compound 1i inhibited 3H-uridine uptake, thereby suppressing RNA synthesis. Thus, the results suggest that its antitumor effect was due to its ability to inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis.","The most outstanding antitumor activity was observed in Compound 1i, which disrupted the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle in MOLT-4 cells. Prior to cell division, DNA duplication takes place during the S phase of the cell cycle. Compound 1i interfered with the S phase as seen through flow cytometric measurement, indicating a direct impact on DNA duplication in tumor cells before mitosis. This possibility was later confirmed in S-180 cells where Compound 1i suppressed DNA synthesis by inhibiting 3 H-thymidine incorporation into the DNA sequence. Further, Compound 1i led to inhibition of RNA synthesis by suppressing 3H-uridine uptake. The combined results suggest that Compound 1i's antitumor effect was mediated through its ability to suppress DNA and RNA synthesis.","Compound 1i possessed the most significant antitumor activity, and it interfered with the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle in MOLT-4 cells. During the S phase of the cell cycle, a cell duplicates its DNA as a prelude to cell division. Flow cytometric measurements revealed that Compound 1i affected the S phase, resulting in a disruption of DNA duplication in tumor cells before mitosis. This possibility was subsequently confirmed in S-180 cells, as Compound 1i inhibited DNA synthesis by impeding the incorporation of 3 H-thymidine into the DNA chain. Moreover, Compound 1i suppressed RNA synthesis by halting 3H-uridine uptake concomitantly. Based on these findings, it appears that Compound 1i's antitumor effect resulted from its capacity to inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis."
"Flow cytometric analysis revealed that MOLT-4 cells treated with compound 1i experienced a delay in exiting G2/M, which is the final phase of the cell cycle. This delay is caused by issues with DNA damage repair, spindle attachment to centromeres, and the polymerization of spindle microtubules, as reported in previous studies. It appears that the compound negatively affects the mitotic apparatus by increasing spindle checkpoint control, resulting in a delayed mitotic exit for daughter cells. Like vinca alkaloids and paclitaxel, which interfere with spindle microtubules to create antitumor effects, compound 1i may operate in a similar manner.","In MOLT-4 cells treated with compound 1i, a delay in exiting the final stage of the cell cycle (G2/M phase) was observed through flow cytometry. This delay typically stems from issues with DNA damage repair, spindle attachment to centromeres, and spindle microtubule polymerization. The compound appears to have an unfavorable effect on the mitotic apparatus, up-regulating spindle checkpoint control and causing a postponement in the mitotic exit of daughter cells. It is suggested that compound 1i functions similarly to antitumor agents such as vinca alkaloids and paclitaxel by triggering changes in spindle microtubules.","According to flow cytometric analysis, MOLT-4 cells treated with compound 1i exhibited a delay in exiting the final stage of the cell cycle, G2/M phase. This delay arises from defects in DNA damage repair, spindle attachment to centromeres, and polymerization of spindle microtubules, which has been reported in past research. The compound appears to have an adverse effect on the mitotic apparatus, causing up-regulation of spindle checkpoint control and leading to a delay in the mitotic exit of daughter cells. Antitumor agents such as vinca alkaloids and paclitaxel act by interfering with spindle microtubules, and compound 1i may be operating in a similar manner."
"The activation of apoptosis, a mechanism of programmed cell death, is a common pathway for several antitumor agents to combat cancer, as stated in source 21. Similarly, Compound 1i has also been shown to exert its antitumor activity through apoptosis. This is evident through the sharp increase in sub-G1 fraction, morphological evidence observed through light and electron microscopic studies, and a significant rise in caspase 3 and 6 levels in treated cells. Apoptosis is coordinated by a range of cell signals that may originate intracellularly from the mitochondria or extracellularly from death receptors located on the cell membrane. These two pathways eventually meet to form an irreversible execution phase mediated by caspase 3 and 6. The intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway and extrinsic or death receptor pathway are possible mechanisms of activating the pro-apoptotic signal elicited by Compound 1i; however, it is not clear which pathway is followed. The ultrastructural study shows mitochondrial cristae damage in treated cells, indicating that the mitochondrial pathway is more inclined. Naphthalimides, including amonafide and its analogs, have previously been reported to induce apoptosis, as illustrated in source 22, 23.","Inducing apoptosis, a programmed cell death mechanism, is a common approach for several antitumor agents to fight cancer, which is mentioned in source 21. Similarly, Compound 1i exhibited its antitumor activity by activating apoptosis. This is confirmed by the increase in sub-G1 fraction, morphological evidence from light and electron microscopic studies, and a significant rise in caspase 3 and 6 levels in treated cells. Different cell signals control apoptosis, which may begin internally through the mitochondria or externally through death receptors located on the cell membrane. These two pathways ultimately converge and produce an irreversible execution stage controlled by caspase 3 and 6. It remains unclear if the pro-apoptotic signal produced by Compound 1i follows the mitochondrial or extrinsic pathway. However, damage to the mitochondrial cristae in treated cells, as observed in the ultrastructural study, supports the mitochondrial pathway. Like the present findings, numerous naphthalimides, such as amonafide and its analogs, have been reported to initiate apoptosis, as per source 22, 23.","The activation of apoptosis, a biomolecular mechanism of programmed cell death, is a common mechanism employed by several antitumor agents to combat cancer, as stated in source 21.

Apoptosis is regulated by a range of cell signals that may arise intracellularly from the mitochondria or extracellularly from death receptors on the cell membrane. These two pathways meet to form an irreversible execution phase mediated by caspase 3 and 6. It remains uncertain whether the pro-apoptotic signal activated by Compound 1i proceeds through the intrinsic (mitochondrial) or extrinsic (death receptor) pathway. Nevertheless, mitochondrial cristae damage was observed in treated cells, as seen from the ultrastructural study, thus implying that Compound 1i indeed activates the mitochondrial pathway. As seen in source 22, 23, the induction of apoptosis by many naphthalimides, such as amonafide and its analogs, is consistent with the present findings."
"The study illustrated that compound 1i displayed significant antitumor activity against murine S-180 tumor cells and various human tumor cell lines in vitro. The mechanism behind this was the inhibition of cell proliferation and an increase in programmed cell death. Notably, the compound didn't indicate any harmful effects towards normal human PBMC, thus showing potential as an antitumor agent in further development.","In summary, the study presented compelling evidence of the remarkable antitumor activity of compound 1i against both murine S-180 tumor cells and various human tumor cell lines in vitro. Such effect resulted from the compound's ability to impede cell proliferation and enhance programmed cell death. The fact that the compound didn't elicit any cytotoxicity on normal human PBMC makes it a promising option for further research as an antitumor agent.","The present study exhibited noteworthy results of the antitumor activity of compound 1i towards murine S-180 tumor cells and a range of human tumor cell lines in vitro by effectively inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting programmed cell death.

Hypofractionation has been found to provide equivalent survival rates to conventional radiotherapy for stage III NSCLC, but without the symptomatic pneumonitis that often proves fatal [3]. Furthermore, the combination of standard-dose erlotinib with chemoradiotherapy does not increase toxicity, making it a feasible option [4].

"Erlotinib, an EGFR TKI, shows effectiveness in treating NSCLC among elderly patients. It can be administered alone in specific advanced NSCLC circumstances with only a 0.8% chance of developing interstitial lung disease. When combined with chemoradiotherapy, standard-dose erlotinib is feasible without increasing the likelihood of harmful side effects. On the other hand, it's important to note that prior tissue injury may impact the response to erlotinib after radiology treatment. Studies suggest that erlotinib can improve radiation reactions and may cause an altered response when administered after radiation, thus enhancing cell cycle arrest, inducing apoptosis, and aiding in DNA repair.","Erlotinib is an effective anti-tumor treatment for NSCLC in elderly patients. It can be used alone in select cases of advanced NSCLC with low occurrences of interstitial lung disease. Combined with chemoradiotherapy, erlotinib does not cause increased toxicities. However, if there is prior tissue damage that resulted from radiation therapy, the cells may have an altered response when treated with erlotinib. Radiosensitizing effects of erlotinib are documented to initiate cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, accelerated cellular repopulation, and DNA damage repair. Consequently, when erlotinib is applied after radiation treatment, cells may exhibit an altered response.","The drug Erlotinib, which is an EGFR TKI, has proven to be an effective agent for treating NSCLC in elderly patients. When administered alone, it can be beneficial in a few select cases of advanced NSCLC without a high possibility of interstitial lung disease. Studies have shown that adding standard dosages of Erlotinib to chemoradiotherapy has been viable without an escalation in associated hazardous effects. However, findings suggest that previous tissue damage from radiation therapy could result in cells with altered responses when the drug is subsequently administered. Research indicates that Erlotinib can expedite cell cycle arrest, induce apoptosis, and repair DNA damage enhancing radiation responses. Consequently, when Erlotinib is given after radiation therapy, it can lead to an altered response in the cells."
"SBRT administered via HT enables the reduction of normal tissue exposure to high levels of radiation. However, while this approach may be beneficial, there is a risk of increased low-dose irradiation to non-target organs that could negatively impact the patient. Recent studies have indicated that arc therapy can amplify the deleterious effects of non-target organ radiation exposure, a phenomenon that can be exacerbated by agents with recall effects. It is also important to note that the administration of anticancer drugs can impact the pharmacokinetics of low-dose irradiation and vice versa, even in off-target regions. Reports have also shown that EGFR inhibitors could enhance both beneficial and adverse effects of radiation. As such, it is critical to exercise caution in prescribing these inhibitors to patients who have undergone radiation therapy.","Although SBRT delivered by HT allows for the reduction of normal tissue exposure to high levels of radiation, there is still the potential for increased low-dose irradiation to non-target organs at risk, leading to the occurrence of lung toxicity. The use of arc therapy may exacerbate this phenomenon due to the low dose bath effect, which could be amplified by other agents that trigger recall effects. Off-target areas could be impacted by anticancer drugs and low-dose irradiation since they modulate each other's pharmacokinetics, potentially leading to unwanted side effects. For example, administration of erlotinib concurrently with radiation has resulted in symptomatic pneumonitis in some NSCLC patients, while others develop radiation recall dermatitis. This suggests that EGFR inhibitors can enhance the beneficial effects and adverse effects of radiation, particularly when given following concurrent treatment with radiation. Furthermore, radiation can also modify the systemic effects of drugs, not just the treatment and side effects.","SBRT combined with HT is a technique that can help to reduce the amount of normal tissue exposure to high levels of radiation. However, there is a possibility of increased non-target organ irradiation at low doses, which can result in lung toxicity. The usage of arc therapy may intensify this situation due to the low dose bath phenomenon, which could be exacerbated by recall effect agents. Low-dose irradiation and anticancer drugs can also affect each other's pharmacokinetics, even in off-target regions, which might lead to undesired side effects. There have been cases in which the administration of EGFR inhibitors has intensified both the beneficial and the harmful effects of radiation, resulting in symptomatic pneumonitis and radiation recall dermatitis in some NSCLC patients. As a result, caution is advised when prescribing EGFR inhibitors to patients who have received concurrent radiation therapy. Moreover, radiation modifies the systemic effects of drugs, possibly causing additional side effects or treatment benefits."

The genus Pestivirus also includes other serious livestock pathogens like bovine viral diarrhea virus and border disease virus. Genetic typing categorizes CSF viruses into three main groups with ten subgroups. Recent phylogenetic analyzes indicate a shift in the virus population from the older groups (1 and 3) to the recent group 2, and this shift has been observed in many European and Asian countries. It is curious to note that, although all live-attenuated vaccine strains belong to group 1, including the subgroup 1.1 Chinese lapinized vaccine strain (C-strain) that has been used for prophylactic vaccination in China since 1954, two independent studies highlight that subgroup 2.1 strains have emerged in China that broke away from the C-strain and became dominant."
"E2 is considered the major envelope glycoprotein present on the surface of the virus particle. Its role in facilitating virus attachment and entry into host cells, as well as determining cell tropism, is vital. This glycoprotein is also designated as a critical virulence determinant. In addition, it can stimulate an immune response resulting in the production of neutralizing antibodies that can provide immunity to pigs. Using monoclonal antibodies, researchers have identified two antigenic units in the N-terminal portion of E2, namely B/C and A/D. Deletion of the C-terminal region has no considerable effect on antibody binding. The antigenic structure of E2 depends on the first six conserved cysteine residues and the motif 771LLFD774.","E2 is a critical envelope glycoprotein located on the surface of the virus particle.

"The genetic diversity of E2 among different groups has undergone extensive study, revealing that the antigenic units could be under positive selection due to continued exposure to high immunologic pressure. The N-terminal half of E2 displays greater variability than the C-terminal half, which suggests that the antigenic units undergo positive selection. Different patterns of reactivity with monoclonal antibodies provide indication of the antigenic variation of E2 among different CSFV isolates. The use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to select mAb-resistant mutants demonstrated that, in most cases, single point mutations could lead to the complete loss of monoclonal antibodies binding. Additionally, the substitution of amino acids at position 710 on the E2 proteins of different strains affected binding and neutralization by a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Studies have shown that single amino acid exchanges between a group 1 vaccine strain LPC and a group 3 field isolate could change the monoclonal antibodies binding pattern entirely. Taken together, variability caused by one or more amino acids within antigenic units may result in the antigenic variation of E2.

The objective of the study was to assess the extent of antigenic variation in glycoprotein E2 antigenic units by raising pig antisera against CSFV vaccine C-strain and a representative subgroup 2.1 strain QZ-07.

"Prokaryotic-derived truncated rE2 proteins have been used for antigen production, identification of antigenic domains, and mapping of epitopes. For this study, two types of truncated rE2 proteins were expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells, namely rE2-BC (aa 690-814) and rE2-AD (aa 690-865). The protein rE2-BC covered the N-terminal 123 residues which are essential for binding to pig anti-CSFV serum, while rE2-AD contained both antigenic units B/C and A/D. Western blotting indicated that the proteins had the correct molecular weights of 20 kDa and 25 kDa, respectively, and reacted strongly with pig anti-C-strain hyperimmune serum. Therefore, these prokaryotic-derived rE2 proteins were found to be suitable for generating monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, as well as for examining antibody binding.","In order to produce antigens, identify antigenic domains, and map epitopes, prokaryotic-derived truncated rE2 proteins have been employed.

"To determine the variation of E2 antigen amid the subgroup 1.1 C-strain and subgroup 2.1 field isolates, researchers assessed the rE2-AD proteins of each strain. They used ELISA to cross-examine these proteins with antisera collected from pigs at different time points after vaccination with the vaccine C-strain or infection with strain QZ-07, which symbolizes subgroup 2.1. The findings, as illustrated in Figure 2, discovered that each antiserum reacted more potently with rE2-AD protein of the homologous strain (used to generate the serum) than that of the heterologous strain. Furthermore, Figure 3 compared the efficacy of the anti-C-strain and anti-QZ-07 sera (obtained at 78 days post-immunization with C-strain and 25 days post-infection with strain QZ-07, respectively) set against rE2AD proteins obtained from C-strain and 8 subgroup 2.1 strains. They set the homologous binding efficiency to 100%, and the results showed that the anti-C-strain serum had significantly less ability to bind to subgroup 2.1 rE2-AD proteins, with less than 60% efficiency. Binding of anti-Q7-07 serum to the C-strain rE2-AD protein was even less efficient, with less than 20% efficiency, and the band was hardly detectable. In contrast, the binding of anti-QZ-07 serum to heterologous subgroup 2.1 proteins varied.","To evaluate the variability of E2 antigens between the C-strain subgroup 1.1 and subgroup 2.1 field isolates, researchers utilized ELISA to cross-examine the respective rE2-AD proteins with porcine serum samples collected at various time intervals following immunization with the vaccine C-strain or infection with strain QZ-07. According to Figure 2, the serum samples reacted more strongly with the rE2-AD protein of the homologous strain (the strain used to prepare the serum) than with that of the heterologous strain. To further compare anti-C-strain and anti-QZ-07 sera binding to rE2AD proteins derived from C-strain and 8 subgroup 2.1 strains, researchers set homologous binding efficiency to 100% and analyzed the results in Figure 3. The outcomes revealed that the anti-C-strain serum had significantly lower efficiency in binding to subgroup 2.1 rE2-AD proteins, with efficiency below 60%. When the anti-Q7-07 serum was measured against the C-strain rE2-AD protein, the binding efficiency was even lower, with efficiency below 20%. Conversely, the binding efficiency of anti-QZ-07 serum to the heterologous subgroup 2.1 proteins varied.","To assess the differences in E2 antigenic variation between the subgroup 1.1 C-strain and subgroup 2.1 field isolates, researchers conducted ELISA analysis of rE2-AD proteins cross-examined with antisera collected at different time points from pigs immunized with the vaccine C-strain or infected with strain QZ-07, which represents subgroup 2.1. The researchers observed that each antiserum had a considerably stronger response to the rE2-AD protein of the homologous strain (the strain used to create the serum) than the heterologous strain.

Researchers set the homologous binding efficiency to 100%, and the data showed that the binding efficiency of the anti-C-strain serum to subgroup 2.1 rE2-AD proteins was significantly low, with less than 60% efficiency. In contrast, the binding efficiency of anti-QZ-07 serum to the heterologous subgroup 2.1 proteins was found to be variable. Interestingly, the ability of the anti-QZ-07 serum to bind to C-strain rE2-AD proteins was weak, with an efficiency below 20%, and the band on the blot was barely visible."
"The effectiveness of heterologous neutralization, demonstrated through a two-way neutralization analysis using the pig antiCSFV sera, was found to be lower with sera collected at the early days following vaccination or infection (Figure 4). Additionally, the efficiency of neutralization was observed to vary between the QZ-07 and HZ1-08 strains in subgroup 2.1. This variation is related to the ability of antisera to neutralize heterologous viruses which led the researchers to investigate whether the variation in glycoprotein E2 affects CSFV cross-neutralization. To investigate further, the researchers raised a rabbit antiserum and three monoclonal antibodies against C-strain rE2-AD protein. The rabbit antiserum showed less effective neutralization of the QZ-07 virus as compared to the C-strain. Furthermore, mAbs 1E7 and 6B8 showed no reactivity to E2 upon substitution of cysteine residues in antigenic unit B/C with serine residues, but no effect was observed in the reactivity of mAb 2B6. The results indicate that mAbs 1E7 and 6B8 are binding to conformational epitopes which involve cysteine residues in E2's structural conformation. However, the neutralization efficiency of mAb 2B6 was low even though it only bound to C-strain. (Table 2).","The researchers found that heterologous neutralization was less effective, especially with sera collected at the early days following vaccination or infection, in a two-way neutralization analysis using pig antiCSFV sera (Figure 4). They also observed differences in the efficiency of neutralization between the QZ-07 and HZ1-08 strains in subgroup 2.1, which is influenced by variation in strains. This led the researchers to investigate whether variation in glycoprotein E2 affects CSFV cross-neutralization. To explore this further, the researchers developed a rabbit antiserum and three monoclonal antibodies against C-strain rE2-AD protein. The rabbit antiserum showed less efficient neutralization of the QZ-07 virus than the C-strain. Interestingly, mutagenesis of cysteine residues in antigenic unit B/C affected the reactivity of mAbs 1E7 and 6B8, but had no effect on mAb 2B6. These results suggest that cysteine residues are involved in E2's structural conformation, and that mAbs 1E7 and 6B8 are binding to conformational epitopes. Additionally, the neutralization efficiency of mAb 2B6 was low, although it only bound to C-strain (Table 2).","Through a two-way neutralization analysis using pig antiCSFV sera, the researchers found that heterologous neutralization was less effective, particularly with sera collected in the early days following vaccination or infection (Figure 4).

To examine this more closely, a rabbit antiserum and three monoclonal antibodies against C-strain rE2-AD protein were cultivated by the researchers. The rabbit antiserum displayed lower neutralization efficiency for the QZ-07 virus in comparison to the C-strain. Furthermore, the substitution of cysteine residues in antigenic unit B/C with serine residues abolished reactivity of mAbs 1E7 and 6B8 to E2, without affecting the reactivity of mAb 2B6. These findings indicate that the cysteine residues in E2 play a role in its structural conformation and that mAbs 1E7 and 6B8 recognize conformational epitopes. However, the neutralization efficiency of mAb 2B6 was low despite its binding only to C-strain (Table 2)."
"E2 sequences of 108 representative CSFV strains from each group were aligned to identify the amino acid residues responsible for the observed antigenic variation.

"Through site-directed mutagenesis, we substituted amino acids in C-strain E2 protein with those present at the same positions in subgroup 2.1 proteins, as listed in Table 3, second to last row.

"To delve deeper into the antigenic and genetic evolution of the antigenic units, an analysis of codon and amino acid diversity was conducted using a variant of Simpson's index.

Meanwhile, the six cysteine residues and the residues located in the 771LLFD774 motif have high conservation even though their codons have undergone a moderate number of synonymous mutations.

"CSFV can be divided into three main groups based on its phylogeny.

"The findings from the study revealed that the pig anti-C-strain and anti-QZ07 sera were observed to have a reduced binding efficiency with heterologous rE2-AD proteins in comparison to their homologous proteins. It was suggested from this that there might be antigenic differences. The E2 protein of the vaccine C-strain was also found to be antigenically different from the wide range of subgroup 2.1 strains, indicating antigenic variation. This difference was also observed in other subgroup 2.1 strains. Moreover, the study further confirmed that the previously reported differences in antigenicity identified using mouse mAbs also occur in the context of pig anti-CSFV sera.","The study's data indicates that both pig anti-C-strain and anti-QZ07 sera bound heterologous rE2-AD proteins with less than 60% efficiency when compared to homologous proteins. The lower binding efficiency suggests the presence of antigenic differences between the proteins. Additionally, it was found that the E2 protein of the C-strain vaccine is antigenically distinct from those of different subgroup 2.1 strains. The inefficiency of the pig anti-QZ-07 serum to bind HZ1-08 and QZ2-06 derived rE2-AD proteins also points towards the presence of antigenic variation among subgroup 2.1 strains. The study further establishes that the differences in antigenicity detected through mouse mAbs also apply to pig anti-CSFV sera.","According to the study's data, the pig anti-C-strain and anti-QZ07 sera had a binding efficiency of less than 60% with heterologous rE2-AD proteins compared to homologous proteins, which suggests that the proteins may have antigenic differences.

"Based on the results of neutralization experiments, we assessed the correlation between the efficiency of antibody binding to rE2 proteins and the ability of the antibody to block CSFV infection.

The findings suggest that the differential expression of antigenic epitopes on the E2 glycoproteins of CSFV strains may explain why subgroup 2.1 CSFV strains persist in China despite the widespread use of the C-strain vaccine. Antibody selection is also thought to play a role in the shift of viral populations from group 1 to 2."
"Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce amino acid substitutions in C-strain rE2 proteins in order to determine if variable residues (listed in Table 3) contribute to antigenic variation in subgroup 2.1 strains. Unlike mutations in the antigenic motif 771LLFD774, which disrupted E2 protein structural integrity, no significant effect on binding to anti-C-strain serum was seen for any of the substitutions, indicating that the protein was not grossly misfolded and the substituted residues may not be crucial for glycoprotein E2's overall structural stability. However, 13 of the 20 substitutions did enhance binding of the variant C-strain rE2 proteins to anti-QZ-07 serum. Residue 713E was a common antigenic determinant for groups 2 and 3, and was most significantly increased by the GtoE substitution at aa position 713. This is in line with recent findings of Chang et al. that 713E and 729D are critical for specificity of a group 3.4 field strain rE2 protein to mAbs.","To investigate whether variable residues (listed in Table 3) contribute to antigenic variation in subgroup 2.1 strains, we employed site-directed mutagenesis in introducing amino acid substitutions in the C-strain rE2 proteins. Notably, while mutations in the antigenic motif 771LLFD774 led to a disruption of E2 protein structural integrity, none of the substitutions exhibited a significant effect on binding to anti-C-strain serum, which suggests that the substituted residues may not be critical for the overall structural stability of glycoprotein E2. Contrarily, substitution of 13 out of the 20 residues resulted in an enhancement in binding of the variant C-strain rE2 proteins to anti-QZ-07 serum. Sequence alignment revealed that residue 713E is a common antigenic determinant for groups 2 and 3, while all vaccine strains possess 713G. Moreover, the GtoE substitution at aa position 713 caused an evident increase in binding, which is in line with a recent report by Chang et al. on the importance of residues 713E and 729D in the specificity of a group 3.4 field strain rE2 protein to mAbs.","The C-strain rE2 proteins were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to determine whether variable residues (listed in Table 3) contribute to the observed antigenic variation in subgroup 2.1 strains. Unlike mutations located in the antigenic motif 771LLFD774, which led to a disruption of E2 protein structural integrity, the substitutions in the protein's variable residues did not show a significant effect on binding to anti-C-strain serum. This implies that the substituted residues may not be critical for the protein's overall structural stability. However, out of the 20 residues, 13 substitutions resulted in the enhanced binding of the variant C-strain rE2 proteins to anti-QZ-07 serum. Sequence alignment showed that residue 713E is a common antigenic determinant for groups 2 and 3, while all vaccine strains have 713G. Additionally, the GtoE substitution at aa position 713 led to a remarkable increase in binding, which is consistent with recent findings by Chang et al. on the importance of residues 713E and 729D in the specificity of a group 3.4 field strain rE2 protein to mAbs."
"Based on our study, it was found that residue 729D did enhance the binding to pig anti-QZ-07 serum, but it was residues 705N, 709P, 723S, and 779A that contributed significantly more to the binding process (as shown in Figure 5A). It is noteworthy that these same residues are also present in the E2 proteins of both subgroup 2.1 and subgroup 3.4 strains, which indicates that these two residues may also be important for antigenicity of subgroup 3.4 glycoprotein E2 when tested with pig antisera against group 3 strains. The use of polyclonal sera collected from pigs that were either infected with a field strain or immunized with C-strain resulted in a broader range of immunization- or infection-induced antibodies. This is why the polyclonal sera were able to identify more residues that contribute to the antigenic variation of glycoprotein E2 as compared to mouse monoclonal antibodies (as described in [35]). In addition, pairing the polyclonal antisera against group 1 C-strain and a representative group 2 field strain provided an additional advantage over mAbs, allowing us to better probe the residues involved in antigenic variation between the two groups.","Our research showed that while residue 729D was able to increase binding to pig anti-QZ-07 serum, residues 705N, 709P, 723S, and 779A had a far greater effect (Figure 5A). Interestingly, these very same residues can also be found at positions 705 and 723 on E2 proteins of strains in both subgroup 2.1 and subgroup 3.4, suggesting that these residues might contribute significantly to the antigenicity of subgroup 3.4 glycoprotein E2 in the presence of pig antisera against group 3 strains. In contrast to mouse mAbs, the use of polyclonal sera from pigs that were immunized with the C-strain or infected with a field strain provided a comprehensive range of immunization- or infection-induced antibodies in our study. The broad response of the polyclonal sera allowed us to identify more residues involved in antigenic variation of glycoprotein E2. Additionally, the polyclonal antisera against group 1 C-strain, when paired with a representative group 2 field strain, helped us explore the residues that mediate antigenic variation between the two groups, which is a further advantage over mAbs.","Our investigation found that although residue 729D increased the binding to pig anti-QZ-07 serum, residues 705N, 709P, 723S, and 779A made a much larger contribution (as demonstrated in Figure 5A). It is worth noting that these same residues are present at positions 705 and 723 on E2 proteins of both subgroup 2.1 and subgroup 3.4 strains, implying that these two residues could also play an essential role in the antigenicity of subgroup 3.4 glycoprotein E2 if tested with pig antisera against group 3 strains. We used polyclonal sera obtained from pigs that were infected with a field strain or immunized with C-strain, resulting in a complete range of immunization- or infection-induced antibodies, unlike mouse mAbs. This is why these polyclonal sera were more effective at identifying residues responsible for glycoprotein E2 antigenic variation. Moreover, matching polyclonal antisera against group 1 C-strain with a representative group 2 field strain enabled us to detect the residues accountable for antigenic variation between the two groups, providing an additional advantage over mAbs."
"The results of the site-directed mutagenesis analysis (Figure 5A) indicate that there is expected antigenic variation among the subgroup 2.1 strains, as each of the 8 strains studied has unique strain-specific substitutions (data not shown). The most significant impact on binding appears to be the C737R substitution in the antigenic units of strain QZ2-06, which can be explained by the importance of the cysteine residue at that position for the protein's antigenic structure. It is believed that the antigenic variation between strain HZ1-08 and the reference subgroup 2.1 strain QZ-07 is likely determined by the E782V substitution in strain HZ1-08.","The site-directed mutagenesis analysis (Figure 5A) reveals that the antigenic variation observed among subgroup 2.1 strains is unsurprising, given that each of the 8 strains analyzed in this study has unique strain-specific substitutions (data not shown). The substitution of C737R in strain QZ2-06, which affects binding the most, can be attributed to the critical role of the cysteine residue at this position in the antigenic structure of the protein. It is postulated that the primary factor leading to antigenic variation between the reference subgroup 2.1 strain QZ-07 and strain HZ1-08 is the E782V substitution in strain HZ1-08.","The data obtained from the site-directed mutagenesis analysis (Figure 5A) demonstrates that the presence of antigenic variation in subgroup 2.1 strains is not unexpected, as each of the 8 strains examined in this study shows unique strain-specific substitutions (data not shown). The most significant impact of these substitutions on binding is manifested in the C737R substitution in strain QZ2-06, which is critical for maintaining the antigenic structure of the protein. It is hypothesized that the E782V substitution in strain HZ1-08 is the key element responsible for antigenic variation between this strain and the reference subgroup 2.1 strain, QZ-07."
"The E2 protein has been found to contain three antigenic regions at amino acid positions 702-731, 774-799 and 841-864, as indicated in Figure 1A. The primary driver of antigenic variation appears to be the 702-731 region, which contains several antigenic residues identified through epitope mapping and substitutions with increased binding to anti-QZ-07 serum. The region 774-799 also contributes to E2 antigenicity, containing a conserved antigenic motif (771LLFD774) and a linear epitope (772LFDGTNP778). Furthermore, substitutions at positions N777S, S779A, and T780I within this region have been found to enhance binding to anti-QZ-07 serum, suggesting multiple functions for this region in shaping the overall antigenicity of E2 protein.","In the E2 protein, three separate regions of antigenicity have been identified within amino acid positions 702-731, 774-799, and 841-864. Figure 1A displays these regions clearly. The area from 702-731 is the primary cause of antigenic variation, as discovery of antigenic residues through mAb-resistant mutants analysis and epitope mapping has identified. Additionally, substitutions in this area have resulted in a significant increase in the variant rE2 protein's binding ability to anti-QZ-07 serum. The region from 774-799 contains an important antigenic motif (771LLFD774) and a conserved linear epitope (772LFDGTNP778), contributing to the integrity of the E2 antigenic structure. Based on further research, substitutions of N777S, S779A, and T780I within this region have increased binding to anti-QZ-07 serum, indicating that the 774-799 region has multiple roles in shaping the overall antigenicity of E2 protein.","The E2 protein has been mapped to reveal three distinct antigenic regions located at amino acid positions 702-731, 774-799, and 841-864. As depicted in Figure 1A, these regions play a critical role in determining the protein's antigenicity. Evidence suggests that the 702-731 region significantly impacts antigenic variation through the clustering of antibody-resistant mutants and epitopes. Additionally, substitutions in this area have resulted in a significant increase in binding for variant rE2 proteins to anti-QZ-07 serum. The 774-799 region contains a conserved antigenic motif (771LLFD774) and a conserved linear epitope (772LFDGTNP778), both of which maintain the overall integrity of the E2 antigenic structure. Furthermore, research has shown that substitution in this region at positions N777S, S779A, and T780I enhances binding to anti-QZ-07 serum, suggesting that it has a significant role in shaping the antigenicity of the E2 protein."
"We examined E2 sequences of CSFV to compare the diversity of codons and amino acids concerning antigenic evolution. To measure this diversity, we used a Simpson's index variant previously applied to influenza virus hemagglutinin glycoprotein to quantify amino acid and codon diversity in the antigenic epitopes. We discovered that the diversity of each amino acid residue implicated in antigenic variation was equal to the corresponding codon's diversity, indicating an astonishing association between antigenic and genetic evolution concerning the antigenic units of glycoprotein E2 in nature. Nevertheless, antigenic residues identified in mAb-resistant mutants showed random diversification, possibly suggesting that in vitro selection can't explain the natural selection in pigs. CSFV may use co-diversification of codons and amino acids implicated with antigenic variation in field strains to evade the immune system under immune pressure and extensive vaccination.","Our analysis involved E2 genetic sequences of CSFV with the primary aim of contrasting codon and amino acid diversification relative to antigenic evolution. To achieve this comparison, we made use of a modified Simpson's index suitable for gauging amino acid and codon diversity in the influenza virus hemagglutinin glycoprotein epitopes. We found that as far as each of the thirteen amino acid residues were concerned, antigenic diversification mirrored an equivalent degree of diversification in codons. This observation provides compelling evidence of a significant correlation between genetic and antigenic evolution within the glycoprotein E2 antigenic units in real-life situations. In contrast, the various antigenic residues that the mutant monoclonal antibody identified tended to diversify randomly (as illustrated in Figure 6), suggesting that in vitro selection might not sufficiently explain natural selection in pigs. As part of its defense mechanism under immune pressure resulting from extensive vaccination, CSFV could use the co-diversification of both codons and amino acids implicated in antigenic variation within field strains.","Our investigation focused on analyzing the E2 sequences of CSFV to compare antigenic evolution's amino acid and codon variability. We utilized a modified variant of the Simpson's index previously designed to measure codon and amino acid diversity of the antigenic epitopes of influenza virus hemagglutinin glycoprotein. Our study showed that there was a perfect match between the diversity of every one of the thirteen amino acid residues involved in the antigenic variations and their corresponding codon diversity. This suggests a strong correlation exists between genetic and antigenic evolution within the E2 glycoprotein antigenic units in nature. On the other hand, antigenic residues identified through mAb-resistant mutants analysis were found to diversify randomly. This observation suggests that in vitro selection may not be a useful predictor of natural selection in pigs. Consequently, co-diversification of codons and amino acids involved in antigenic variation in field strains of CSFV may be employed as one of the immune evasion mechanisms under immune pressure and extensive vaccination."
"The study has shown that the glycoprotein E2 of CSFV can undergo antigenic variation between the vaccine C-strain and the group 2 field strains, as well as within the current group 2 strains found in China. The primary determinants of this variation are the substitutions in the first region of the three identified areas, specifically aa 702-731. These substitutions can have an impact on the cross-neutralization of CSFV. To verify if these residues contribute to the differences in neutralization observed, further work is needed. The results obtained from this research may offer valuable information in developing CSF vaccines that have a better immune response and efficacy, and differential serological assays.","The report has revealed that the glycoprotein E2 of CSFV undergoes antigenic variation when compared between the vaccine C-strain and the group 2 field strains, as well as within the group 2 strains found in China currently. The main determinant is the substitutions found in the first region, which corresponds to aa 702-731 out of the three regions identified in the study. These substitutions affect the cross-neutralization of CSFV. Further investigation is mandatory to understand whether these residues contribute to the variations in neutralization observed. The outcome of this research can assist in creating differential serological assays and CSF vaccines with better immunogenicity and efficacy.","The research demonstrates the antigenic variation of CSFV glycoprotein E2 in the current group 2 strains circulating in China and between these strains and the vaccine C-strain. The primary driver of this variation has been identified as substitutions within the first of three discrete regions associated with antigenic variation, namely, aa 702-731. The variation in glycoprotein E2 has implications on CSFV cross-neutralization. Further work is needed to determine whether these antigenic residues contribute to the observed differences in neutralization. The findings of this study can aid in the development of novel CSF vaccines with enhanced immunogenicity and efficacy, as well as differential serological assays."

Throughout this entire process, animal welfare was of utmost importance, and experiments with animals were authorized by Zhejiang University's Laboratory Animal Management Committee.","The production of monoclonal antibodies targeting the rE2-AD protein of C-strain involved a series of steps. Firstly, four 5-week-old female specific-pathogen-free BALB/c mice were immunized with 0.1 mg of purified rE2-AD protein of vaccine C-strain emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant through subcutaneous injection. The mice subsequently received two intraperitoneal boosts of the protein, emulsified in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant at 2-week intervals. Following the final boost, the mice were euthanized and their spleen cells harvested. SP2/0 myeloma cells were then fused with the harvested splenocytes using polyethylene glycol.

"To investigate the impact of BMI on breast cancer risk in women of different menopausal status, we analyzed data separately for women aged below 55 years (considered premenopausal) and those aged 55 years and above (postmenopausal). This was because BMI has been shown to have different associations with breast cancer risk in these two groups of women. We used logistic regression models that adjusted for appropriate risk factors and included dummy variables to estimate the per-allele odds ratios (ORs) for SNPs. We did not present estimates obtained using a younger age limit (50 years) as these were similar to those obtained using the age categories as surrogates for pre- and post-menopausal status.","The study examined the relationship between BMI and breast cancer risk in women based on their menopausal status. The analysis was conducted separately for women aged below 55 years (premenopausal) and those aged 55 years and above (postmenopausal) as BMI has different associations with breast cancer risk in these two groups. To estimate the per-allele odds ratios (ORs) for SNPs that affect breast cancer risk, the logistic regression models were adjusted for appropriate risk factors and included dummy variables. The findings using a younger age limit of 50 years to determine the premenopausal status surrogate showed similar results to those using the age categories; as such, those results were not presented.","The study aimed to investigate the impact of BMI on breast cancer risk in women based on their menopausal status.

Estimates of per-allele odds ratios (ORs) for SNPs associated with breast cancer risk were obtained using logistic regression models that took into account relevant risk factors and included dummy variables. The analysis using a younger age limit of 50 years to classify the premenopausal status surrogate yielded similar results to those obtained using age categories and was, therefore, not presented."
"The study employed logistic regression models to determine if there was an interaction or modification of genetic associations caused by other risk factors. The models included dummy variables for the study and three parameters: one for the main per-risk-allele impact, one for the chief risk factor impact (with all modeled as continuous variables, except for ever having had a live birth), and one for the interaction term which combined the number of risk alleles and the risk factor's value. The addition of the interaction term was tested statistically by comparing the model with the interaction term to the model without using a likelihood ratio test. Lastly, the study analyzed the effect modification caused by BMI for women, categorized into those who were younger than 55 and those who were 55 years and older, with separate evaluations conducted for each age group.","Logistic regression models were utilized in the study to examine whether there was an interaction or modification of genetic associations by other risk factors.

The statistical significance of the interaction term was determined using a likelihood ratio test to compare the model with and without the interaction term. In addition, the study assessed the effect modification caused by BMI separately for women who were younger than 55 and those who were 55 years or older.","To assess whether there was an interaction or modification of genetic associations by other risk factors, the study employed logistic regression models.

"The team utilized a parametric bootstrap test to calculate interaction P-values adjusted for multiple testing. They estimated the chance of each subject being a case for every one of the 72 interactions tested based on a logistic regression model that took into account only main effects. Specifically, study (categorical), SNP (per-allele), and risk factor (continuous, except ever having had a live birth) were considered. The parametric bootstrap comprised generating a dummy case-control status for each subject and fitting the interaction model as mentioned above, based on actual data for all other variables.

"The risk factors for breast cancer were analyzed in population-based studies, and most of the expected associations were observed, except for one.

"There is evidence to suggest that the association between 11p15-rs3817198 (LSP1) and breast cancer risk may be influenced by the number of live births a woman has had, with a stronger effect observed among those who have had four or more live births.

"The evidence for effect modification was strongest for the number of live births and a specific gene variant called 11p15-rs3817198 (LSP1). Nevertheless, the increase in relative risk that correlates with an increased parity did not have any statistical significance after taking multiple testing into account. It's worth mentioning that the interaction odds ratio (OR) was just 1.05 per allele and live birth, resulting in an estimated per-allele OR increase from 1.04 in women with only one child to 1.24 in women with four or more kids, for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with an average OR of 1.08 in various parity levels. Since the weak interactions found here would only make a negligible difference in joint effects estimates compared to models assuming multiplicative effects, this finding emphasizes the difficulty of identifying modifying effects of this magnitude in massive studies.","The study's strongest evidence of effect modification was seen in the correlation between the number of live births and the 11p15-rs3817198 (LSP1) gene variant. However, the increase in relative risk with increased parity did not have statistical significance after multiple testing corrections. It is essential to note the interaction odds ratio (OR) of just 1.05 per allele and per live birth. Consequently, the per-allele OR had only a minor increase of 1.04 for women with a single child to 1.24 in women with four or more children for an estimated average OR of 1.08 across all parity levels for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The study's weak interactions would have resulted in only minimal differences in joint effects estimates compared to models where multiplicative effects are assumed. This finding demonstrates the challenge of identifying the modifying effects of this contingent in enormous studies.","The study found the strongest evidence of effect modification for the number of live births and the 11p15-rs3817198 (LSP1) gene variant. However, the increase in relative risk associated with higher parity was not statistically significant after accounting for multiple testing. Notably, the interaction odds ratio (OR) was only 1.05 per allele and per live birth. This resulted in a minor increase in the per-allele OR, rising from 1.04 in women with one child to 1.24 in women with four or more children. For the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which had an average OR of 1.08 across all parity levels, these weak interactions would only have slight differences in joint effects estimates relative to models that assume multiplicative effects.

"One of the major strengths of the BCAC is its ability to achieve a large combined sample size via international collaborations. This has been very effective in confirming or rejecting the relationship between common SNPs identified through GWAS and candidate gene studies and breast cancer. The consortium is also capable of providing highly precise estimates of the ORs related to susceptibility alleles with noticeable consistency, even with the range of study designs included by different studies. However, the representation of multiple studies that employed volunteered controls or selected cases can affect the assessment of some risk factors' primary effects across the whole consortium. But this selection bias doesn't affect the evaluation of interactions. Nonetheless, we analyzed the data from only population-based studies and studies with at least 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls in sensitivity analyses which generated similar results concerning interactions.","The BCAC's primary positive attribute is its substantial combined sample size achieved through international cooperation. This has proven to be exceptionally successful in confirming or rejecting the association of common SNPs identified through GWAS and candidate gene studies and breast cancer. The consortium has also provided precise estimates of ORs related to susceptibility alleles, characterized by remarkable consistency, despite the variety of study designs used among the participating members. However, due to the multiple studies' representation, which recruited volunteered controls or selected cases, it's not possible to achieve an appropriate evaluation of some risk factors' primary effects across the entire consortium. Nonetheless, this selection bias doesn't influence the interaction assessment. In light of this, we conducted sensitivity analyses that included only data from population-based studies and studies with at least 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls. The results obtained in terms of interactions remain consistent.","The BCAC's significant strength is its vast sample size, obtained through international collaborations.

The consortium can provide highly precise estimates of ORs associated with susceptibility alleles, with consistency observed between the various studies, despite the different study designs utilized. However, because many studies recruited selected cases and/or volunteer controls, evaluating the primary effects of some risk factors across the consortium may not be appropriate. Despite the potential selection bias, this does not impact the assessment of interactions in any way. Nonetheless, we conducted sensitivity analyses that included only data from population-based studies and studies with a minimum of 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls. Interestingly, the results obtained regarding interactions remain largely unchanged."
"The heterogeneity in data collection methods across studies is one of the potential limitations of our study. Structured questionnaires were used in all studies except for two that were not population-based, and these questionnaires were administered using various methods such as in-person interviews, phone interviews, and self-administration. Although some variations in data collection methods may have impacted our findings on BMI, other factors such as age at menarche, number of live births, age at first birth, and ever having had a live birth are expected to be reliable despite these differences. To mitigate any systematic bias, we standardized measurements within studies and adjusted for study as a covariate. We also conducted further analyses by excluding cases that were interviewed before, or more than two years after their breast cancer diagnosis, and the results did not significantly differ. However, one of the limitations of our study was the lack of information on hormone therapy use in the majority of participating studies, which precluded any evaluation of interactions between SNPs and BMI in older women.","One possible drawback of our study is the heterogeneous data collection techniques used across studies. All studies utilized structured questionnaires, but only two studies (which were not population-based) did not administer them via self-administration, in-person interviews or phone interviews. Despite this variation in data collection, our evaluations of age at menarche, age at first birth, number of live births, and ever having had a live birth are deemed to be robust. However, BMI results are more prone to be affected because of inconsistent data collection techniques. Still, we have taken steps to minimize any potential shortcomings by measuring standardized data within studies and controlling for study status as a covariate, reducing any systematic bias to a higher loss of power. In addition, we also performed our key analyses again, ignoring examples where patients were assessed before, or more than two years after their diagnosis of breast cancer, and the outcomes did not vary significantly. Regrettably, we were unable to collect data on hormone therapy (HT) use from most of the participating studies and, as a result, could not evaluate interactions between SNPs and BMI by HT use in older women.","The heterogeneity in data collection methods is a potential limitation of our study. All studies except for two, neither of which were population-based, used structured questionnaires that were administered in various ways such as in-person interviews, phone interviews, and self-administration. Although we found some inconsistencies in data collection methods that might have affected our BMI results, the measures of age at menarche, ever having had a live birth, number of live births, and age at first birth are assumed to be robust. We have tried to address this limitation by standardizing measurements within studies and adjusting the study as a covariate to decrease potential systematic bias to a lower extent of power loss. We also repeated our primary analyses by excluding examples in which patients were assessed before, or more than two years after, their diagnosis of breast cancer, and we did not observe any meaningful differences. A further limitation of this study is that we did not collate information on hormone therapy (HT) use from the majority of participating studies, and therefore we could not analyze interactions between SNPs and BMI by HT use in older women."
"The study conducted the largest collaborative analyses of gene-environment interactions to date and did not find any conclusive evidence of a modification of per-allele relative risk regarding common breast cancer susceptibility variants by age at menarche, parity, age at first birth, or BMI. Results of the study were consistent with a recent smaller prospective study, suggesting that the combined effects of these common susceptibility alleles and other established risk factors could be assumed to be multiplicative in risk predicted models for breast cancer.","The research conducted the most extensive collaborations in analyzing gene-environment interactions, and the results did not indicate any definitive proof for the modification of per-allele relative risk caused by common breast cancer susceptibility variants by BMI, age at menarche, parity, or age at first birth.

This implies that the combinational effects of common susceptibility alleles with other well-known risk factors may be viewed as multiplicative in risk models meant to predict the occurrence of breast cancer.","The study carried out the largest collaborative analyses of gene-environment interactions to date and found no conclusive evidence of per-allele relative risk modification linked to common breast cancer susceptibility variants by age at menarche, parity, age at first birth or BMI.

"Anopheles funestus plays a significant role in the transmission of malaria in southern Africa. According to early research, Plasmodium falciparum parasite rates were as high as 22% in South Africa [1], primarily transmitted by this mosquito species.

"An extensive indoor residual spraying campaign with DDT was carried out in the 1950s in South Africa, leading to the eradication of An. funestus. Over the next half-century, this species was recorded just once during a small malaria outbreak in the country's northern region. However, in 1999/2000, South Africa experienced its worst malaria epidemic since the implementation of IRS in the 1950s, and An. funestus was once again found in northern KwaZulu/Natal, just south of Mozambique. The mosquitoes were found to be resistant to both pyrethroids and carbamates, and they had a 5.4 per cent P. falciparum parasite rate.","Back in the 1950s, South Africa launched an intensive indoor residual spraying campaign that utilized DDT to eliminate An. funestus.

"Based on subsequent studies carried out in the southern region of Mozambique, it was discovered that the group of An. funestus that has developed insecticide resistance has a larger population located to the north of the capital city named Maputo [7-9]. Recently, research revealed that An. funestus specimens collected from Chokwe [10], which is roughly 200 kilometers north of the capital, equally demonstrated insecticidal resistance, even though formerly, this population was assumed to be susceptible according to previous studies [8].","After conducting subsequent research in the Southern Mozambique area, it was determined that the group of An. funestus populations that have developed insecticide resistance has a geographic range that extends beyond the boundaries of the capital city, Maputo [7-9].

"A mosquito surveillance initiative was conducted in Likoma Island, located in Lake Malawi (12°04’S, 34°44’E) during May 2010 (Figure 1). The island is comprised of several high points, with inhabitants living in separated homesteads and occupied mostly with fishing and subsistence farming.

"One field study analyzed the resistance of 111 An. funestus females with an unknown age to insecticides. No temperature or humidity regulation was implemented during the experimentation.

"A total of 223 An. funestus mosquitos underwent DNA tests, which encompassed all wild adults employed in the susceptibility experiments (n = 111) and the captive females that were brought to the lab to lay eggs (n = 112). Nearly all of the mosquitos, about 97.3%, were accurately identified as An. funestus s.s.

"The outcomes of the primary insecticide susceptibility tests performed on the island using An. funestus were presented in Table 1. The female mosquitoes were not of a known age. The results showed that there was a rate of >5% mortality in controls; hence, the findings were corrected using Abbott's formula [14]. As a result, the mortality rates of 77.8% in deltamethrin and 56.4% in bendiocarb were obtained. Furthermore, the effectiveness of field papers was tested in the laboratory using a susceptible An. gambiae colony.

"In the laboratory, An. funestus females aged 1-5 days were utilized for the second round of insecticide susceptibility testing.

The team tested nine different insecticides from all four categories and tabulated the results in Table 2 for easy reference."
The sample size of An. arabiensis female specimens that were bred from larvae was too insufficient (with n = 42) to carry out susceptibility tests in a meaningful manner.,"Due to the limited number of An. arabiensis females that were reared from larvae (n = 42), it was not possible to conduct susceptibility tests in a significant manner.",It was not feasible to carry out susceptibility tests in a meaningful way due to the small sample size of An. arabiensis female specimens bred from larvae (n = 42).
"The susceptibility tests for deltamethrin showed a significant difference between the wild females captured in the field and the 1-5 day old laboratory reared F-1 progeny (p<0.005). This difference could be attributed to two factors. Firstly, high temperatures could have resulted in the high mortality rate of mosquitoes exposed to insecticides. Secondly, An. funestus may have age-dependent susceptibility to the sub-class of pyrethroids. As the survey was conducted in May, which is towards the end of the transmission season, aging female mosquitoes in the field were more susceptible to insecticides. It is noteworthy that even though female mosquitoes tended to age, the female mosquitoes that had fed and mated did not show a decrease in resistance over time.","The observed disparity in deltamethrin susceptibility between wild females from the field and 1-5 day old F-1 progeny raised in the laboratory (p < 0.005) can be explained in two ways. Firstly, high temperatures can affect the survival of mosquitoes when they are exposed to insecticides, and this could be responsible for the high mortality rates that were observed in the field samples. Secondly, it is possible that the susceptibility of An. funestus to this type of pyrethroids may vary depending on the age of the mosquito. As the research was conducted towards the end of the transmission season in May, it is highly likely that the wild-caught female mosquitoes tested in the field were older, which explains their higher susceptibility to insecticides. However, earlier research by Hunt et al. suggests that females that have mated and fed on blood do not exhibit a decrease in resistance over time, which suggests that while the tested wild populations might be aging, they would have all taken numerous blood meals and be mated.","The deltamethrin susceptibility tests conducted on wild female mosquitoes from the field and laboratory-reared 1-5 day old F-1 progeny (p<0.005) yielded a significant difference, which can be attributed to two causes. One reason is that mosquitoes' exposure to insecticides at high temperatures can influence their survival rates [15], which may, in turn, result in the high mortality rate seen in the field samples. Secondly, the sub-class of pyrethroids, to which An. funestus is susceptible, could be age-dependent [16]. Since the survey was completed at the end of the transmission season in May, the aging wild-caught female mosquitoes in the field would have been more receptive to insecticides. As a point of note, Hunt et al. [16] found that mated and blood-fed female mosquitoes did not experience any weakening of resistance over time, implying that aging wild populations would be mated and have had multiple blood meals."
"It is apparent from the susceptibility results that a resistance management plan needs to be created and put into operation to manage malaria on Likoma Island. If there is a wide distribution of pyrethroid treated bed nets on the island, simultaneous IRS with an organophosphate or DDT must be performed to control resistance. Carbamates cannot be utilized as frequently, as there are high rates of survival. However, An. funestus is fully responsive to DDT, providing an opportunity to employ DDT for IRS, possibly in rotation with one of the organophosphates.","The susceptibility findings indicate that a resistance management strategy must be developed and implemented to manage malaria on Likoma Island. If there is extensive distribution of pyrethroid treated bed nets on the island, concomitant IRS must be carried out with an organophosphate or DDT to manage resistance. As there are high survival rates, carbamates are not a feasible option. However, An. funestus is entirely susceptible to DDT, which raises the possibility of using DDT for IRS, perhaps in a rotation with one of the organophosphates.","Based on the susceptibility results, it is evident that a resistance management strategy is indispensable to controlling malaria on Likoma Island. For effective resistance management, concurrent IRS with an organophosphate or DDT must be implemented along with the widespread distribution of pyrethroid treated bed nets. Due to its high frequency of survival, carbamates are not a viable option. Nevertheless, the An. funestus population appears to be fully susceptible to DDT, offering the possibility of using DDT for IRS, perhaps in rotation with one of the organophosphates."
"The use of bed nets is already widespread on the island and varies greatly in terms of treatment, age, and condition. Although nets are available in many households, they are not always being used. Thus, if implementing a strategy that combines bed nets and IRS, it is crucial to educate and monitor residents to ensure consistent use of bed nets. If mosquito populations decline due to seasonal changes or control measures, some individuals may stop using the nets altogether. Furthermore, due to the fact that the community depends on fishing for its livelihood, some nets may be repurposed for this purpose (refer to Figure 2 for more details).","The island already has extensive usage of bed nets, with a range of treated and untreated nets in different conditions, such as old and new, damaged and intact. However, there is considerable variation in the use of bed nets. Many households have bed nets, but not everyone uses them consistently. Thus, if a bed net and IRS combination approach is being considered, it's essential to ensure that education and monitoring are in place to promote consistent use of bed nets. When mosquito populations decrease due to seasonal changes or control measures, some people may stop using the nets. Additionally, given that fishing provides a livelihood for many people in the community, some nets may be used for this purpose (see Figure 2 for more information).","The usage of bed nets on the island is already prevalent, with a variety of nets available that differ in their treatments, age, and condition. However, there is noticeable variability in their usage, with many households having bed nets but not using them regularly. Therefore, if a bed net and IRS combination strategy is being considered, education and monitoring will be vital for maintaining consistent net usage. As mosquito populations decrease due to seasonal changes or control measures, many people may stop using bed nets. Furthermore, in a fishing-dependent community, some nets may be re-purposed for fishing activities (refer to Figure 2 for additional details)."
"The identification of pyrethroid and carbamate resistance in the An. funestus population approximately 1,500 km north of Chokwe in southern Mozambique - as depicted in Figure 1 - is the most concerning finding of this survey. In 2006, samples collected from central Mozambique indicated that An. funestus had a mortality rate of over 95% to pyrethroids and carbamates, according to a report by Casimiro et al. [9]. The WHO's criteria suggest that susceptibility at this level needs further investigation, but control programs may not change policy based solely on this frequency of resistance/susceptibility.","In this survey, the most worrying aspect was the detection of pyrethroid and carbamate resistance in the An. funestus population situated roughly 1,500 km north of its known range in southern Mozambique as Figure 1 details [10]. According to Casimiro et al.'s report in 2006, An. funestus from central Mozambique exhibited more than 95% mortality to pyrethroids and carbamates [9]. Although the WHO's criteria suggest conducting further investigations in such a scenario, it is unlikely that a control program would alter its policy solely on this level of resistance or susceptibility.","The most alarming finding of this survey is that the An. funestus population exhibits pyrethroid and carbamate resistance, which has been detected around 1,500 km north of Chokwe in southern Mozambique, as per Figure 1 [10]. Samples obtained from central Mozambique in 2006 indicated that An. funestus had more than 95% mortality to pyrethroids and carbamates, according to a report published by Casimiro et al. [9]. Although the susceptibility level of this magnitude necessitates further investigation under the WHO criteria, a control program is unlikely to change its policy primarily based on resistance/susceptibility frequencies."
"Likoma Island is positioned in Lake Malawi in close proximity to Mozambique. It is believed that mosquitoes may travel from Mozambique via wind or boats that operate between the island and the mainland, further suggesting that the An. funestus population in Northern Mozambique is also resistant. This could have grave consequences for current malaria control efforts in the region. Since resistance to both pyrethroid and carbamate is present in the Likoma population, it is indicative that resistance is expanding northwards through gene flow in An. funestus populations as opposed to arising through genetic mutation events. As there are no apparent physical barriers to gene flow, the resistance is expected to spread northwards into southern Tanzania and westwards into Zambia and Zimbabwe. Moreover, observations indicate that the resistance found in An. funestus populations from Uganda differs from that in populations in southern Africa, regarding susceptibility tests and molecular characterization of P450 genes.","The island of Likoma in Lake Malawi is located just a few kilometers away from Mozambique, and it is possible that mosquitoes are carried over through wind or via boats that travel from the island to the mainland. As a result, it is probable that An. funestus populations in northern Mozambique are already resistant, creating serious concerns for malaria control attempts in the region. Similar to populations further south, pyrethroid and carbamate resistance has been found in the An. funestus populations on Likoma, indicating that resistance is likely spreading northwards through gene flow rather than separate genetic mutations. There are no evident geographical obstacles to gene flow in this area of southern Africa, and it can be assumed that resistance will expand northwards into southern Tanzania and westwards into Zambia and Zimbabwe. The recent finding of resistance in An. funestus populations from Uganda signifies a difference from that found in populations from southern Africa based on susceptibility tests and molecular characterization of P450 genes.","Located in Lake Malawi, Likoma Island is just a few kilometers from Mozambique, and the mosquitoes might be transported by wind or ships that sail between the island and the mainland. It could then be assumed that the An. funestus population in northern Mozambique is also resistant to malaria, which could affect malaria control initiatives underway in the area. Concerningly, the An. funestus population on Likoma Island has exhibited resistance to both pyrethroid and carbamate, similar to other populations in southern regions, suggesting that resistance is spreading northwards via gene flow instead of genetic mutations. With no apparent barriers to gene flow in southern Africa, it's probable that the resistance will spread northwards into southern Tanzania and westwards into Zambia and Zimbabwe. However, a recent observation of An. funestus resistance from Uganda shows differences from the one found in southern Africa's populations based on susceptibility tests and molecular characterization of P450 genes."
The urgent requirement for resistance management programs within malaria vector control initiatives in southern Africa highlights the gravity of the rapid increase of insecticide resistance in An. funestus. This paper carries the message of the seriousness of this issue that is currently being faced by the region.,"In order to tackle the rapid spread of insecticide resistance observed in An. funestus in southern Africa, it is necessary to prioritize resistance management strategies within malaria vector control programs in the region. This paper brings to light the seriousness of the situation and highlights the urgent need for action to address this issue.","The rapid emergence of insecticide resistance in An. funestus in southern Africa is a pressing concern that needs to be addressed urgently through resistance management strategies implemented within malaria vector control programs. The gravity of this issue is underscored by this paper, which emphasizes the need for proactive measures to be taken within the region to address this growing problem."
"Hypoxia is a condition in which there is a lack of oxygen, and solid tumors are known to have abnormal hyperactivity of angiogenesis, which is the process of creating new blood vessels from existing ones. This process is strictly controlled by specific molecules that can either activate or inhibit it under normal physiological conditions. However, solid tumors eventually trigger angiogenesis to overcome the lack of oxygen and nutrients they face after reaching a specific burden. Hypoxia-activated angiogenesis is mainly mediated by the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF-A), which is produced by tumor cells when they sense low oxygen levels. In addition to hypoxia-mediated initiation, VEGF-A expression can also be induced by non-hypoxia-mediated activation, such as Ras signaling.","The process of angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, with its activation facilitated by proangiogenic factors and inhibition controlled by antiangiogenic factors. However, solid tumors exhibit abnormal hyperactivation of angiogenesis, and this is related to their need to overcome hypoxia, which is the lack of oxygen, and absence of necessary nutrients. An important mediator of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis is the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF-A), which is produced by tumor cells after sensing low oxygen levels. VEGF-A expression can also be induced through non-hypoxia-mediated activation, such as Ras signaling.","Angiogenesis is the process of creating new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, which is tightly regulated by specific molecules that either enable or inhibit the process. In contrast, solid tumors have been associated with abnormal hyperactivation of angiogenesis as a result of hypoxia, a condition marked by oxygen deficiency. This enables the tumor cells to overcome the lack of nutrients and oxygen that would hinder their growth and continued proliferation. The Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF-A) is an essential mediator of angiogenesis activation in hypoxic conditions, resulting in the formation of new blood vessels to supply the necessary nutrients to the tumor. Additionally, VEGF-A expression may also be activated through non-hypoxia-mediated mechanisms such as Ras signaling."
"VEGF-A is a crucial component of tumor-induced angiogenesis, with its overexpression having been observed in the majority of solid tumor types. VEGF-A communicates with its receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, present on bone marrow-derived and endothelial cells. Targeting the VEGF pathway has been a significant strategy to prevent tumor angiogenesis. Over the years, scientists have developed a range of molecules that block various components of the VEGF-A pathway. Some of these agents, like bevacizumab (Avastin庐, Genentech) and sunitinib (Sutent庐, Pfizer), have already been introduced into clinical practice. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inactivates VEGF-A by binding to it, while sunitinib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor that prevents phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine-kinase receptors containing VEGFR1 and VEGFR2.","VEGF-A is a critical mediator of tumor-induced angiogenesis, and its upregulation has been recorded in most types of solid tumors. The VEGF-A molecule interacts with its associated receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, found on endothelial or bone marrow-derived cells. The VEGF pathway, which is a key target of anti-angiogenic therapies, has been the focus of drug development. Several molecules have been discovered in recent years that can inhibit different components of the VEGF-A pathway. A few of these drugs, like bevacizumab (Avastin庐, Genentech) and sunitinib (Sutent庐, Pfizer), have already made their way into clinical practice. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inactivates VEGF-A by binding to it, whereas sunitinib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor that blocks the phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine-kinase receptors, including VEGFR1 and VEGFR2.","VEGF-A is an essential participant in tumor-induced angiogenesis, and its expression is elevated in most forms of solid tumors. VEGF-A signals through its receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, which are present on endothelial and bone marrow-derived cells. The VEGF signaling pathway has been a significant target for blocking tumor angiogenesis, and scientists have developed several drug molecules that bind and inhibit various components of the VEGF-A pathway. Some of these drugs, such as bevacizumab (Avastin庐, Genentech), a monoclonal antibody that binds and inactivates VEGF-A, and sunitinib (Sutent庐, Pfizer), a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor that blocks the phosphorylation of several tyrosine-kinase receptors, including VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, have already proven their therapeutic value in clinical practice."
"The VEGF-A gene comprises 8 exons and creates 5 main alternatively spliced isoforms (VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206), and it can generate lengthier isoforms via alternative translation codons. Nevertheless, the significance of these isoforms remains uncertain. Recently, a novel set of isoforms called ""b-isoforms"" or ""VEGFxxxb"" isoforms were discovered, which code for lengthy polypeptides similar to classic isoforms. However, these isoforms are unique due to the substitution of exon 8 with the same-sized alternatively spliced exon (exon 8b), which acts as potential antagonists of VEGF-A receptors. Exon 8 is essential for receptor activation in classically studied isoforms. As a result, ""b-isoforms"" were previously mentioned to act as potential antagonists of VEGF-A receptors. Some studies indicated that VEGF165b has anti-angiogenic properties, while others suggested it may work as an agonist of VEGF-A receptors.","The VEGF-A gene is made up of 8 exons and can produce 5 primary alternatively spliced isoforms (VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206), with the potential for longer isoforms to be generated. The significance of these isoforms remains uncertain. Recently, a novel group of isoforms referred to as ""b-isoforms"" or ""VEGFxxxb"" isoforms were discovered. These isoforms generate polypeptides equivalent in length to classic isoforms, with exon 8 (present in all previously known isoforms) being replaced by an alternately spliced exon of the same size (exon 8b). As a result of the exon 8 substitution, the ""b-isoforms"" were hypothesized to have the potential to act as antagonists of VEGF-A receptors. Exon 8 is recognized to be essential for receptor activation in classically studied isoforms. Some research indicates that VEGF165b may have anti-angiogenic activity, while others suggest that it may act as an agonist of VEGF-A receptors.","The VEGF-A gene has eight exons, leading to the development of five primary alternatively spliced isoforms (VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206). Longer isoforms can also be created due to the employment of alternative translation codons upstream of the canonical ATG codon. The contribution of these isoforms remains uncertain. Recently, a unique set of isoforms named ""b-isoforms"" or ""VEGFxxxb"" isoforms have been reported. These transcripts of the VEGF-A gene have the potential to produce polypeptides identical in length to classical ones since exon 8, found in all known isoforms, is substituted with the same-sized alternatively spliced exon (exon 8b). These ""b-isoforms"" are considered to act as possible antagonists of VEGF-A receptors because exon 8, known to be fundamental for receptor activation in classically investigated isoforms, is replaced by another peptide sequence. Research reports suggest that VEGF165b can have anti-angiogenic effects, while some others doubt its effectiveness, considering it may act as an agonist of VEGF-A receptors."
"An interesting point of discussion is the probable discrepancy in expression of ""angiogenic"" and ""antiangiogenic"" isoforms in diseases involving abnormal vasculature growth, such as cancer. Previous studies have shown that VEGFxxxb isoforms are expressed at higher levels in regular prostate, colon, and kidney tissues when compared to their cancerous counterparts, based on semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis on a limited number of samples [14,18,19]. It is postulated that formation of neovasculature during pathological conditions could modify alternative splicing of VEGFA, leading to increased expression of the ""b-isoforms"" (which consist of anti-angiogenic properties) at the expense of the classical angiogenic isoforms. Interestingly, the VEGFxxxb/VEGF ratio may serve as a biomarker of angiogenic disease, offering significant implications for further research [13].","The concept of differential expression between ""angiogenic"" versus ""antiangiogenic"" isoforms in diseases that involve the growth of abnormal vasculature, such as cancer, is a fascinating topic. Earlier studies have revealed that the VEGFxxxb isoforms are highly expressed in regular prostate, colon, and kidney tissues in comparison to their malignantly transformed counterparts, using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and with a limited number of samples [14,18,19]. The idea is that the development of new blood vessels during pathological conditions could change the alternative splicing of VEGFA, causing an increase in expression of the ""b-isoforms"" at the expense of the conventional assemblage of angiogenic isoforms, which is also an interesting finding as the VEGFxxxb/VEGF ratio of expression could be utilized as a biomarker of angiogenic disease [13].","An interesting subject of discussion is the difference in expression of ""angiogenic"" versus ""antiangiogenic"" isoforms in pathologies involving the development of abnormal vasculature, such as cancer. Prior research has shown that VEGFxxxb isoforms are highly expressed in normal prostate, colon, and kidney tissues compared to their malignant counterparts, with the use of semi-quantitative RT-PCR on limited samples [14,18,19]. It has been suggested that the formation of neovasculature in pathological conditions could alter alternative splicing of VEGFA, leading to an increase in the expression of the ""b-isoforms"" (known to be inhibitory to angiogenesis) at the expense of the conventional angiogenic family of isoforms, which could be an exciting discovery, as the VEGFxxxb/VEGF ratio of expression could serve as a tool for diagnosing angiogenic diseases [13]."

"Matrigel plug assays were carried out to assess the impact of VEGF121/165b isoforms on the functioning of endothelial cells in vivo. Matrigel was combined with bFGF or VEGF165 from R&D or VEGF121b(pp) or VEGF165b(pp). The identification of blood vessels within the Matrigel plugs was accomplished by administering an Alexa-647-labelled isolectin B4, which was systemically delivered to the mice before they were sacrificed (Figure 5A). The Alexa-647-labelled lectin showed no signal in the control Matrigels, whereas plugs carrying any VEGFxxxb isoforms indicated a positive signal, thus confirming in vivo angiogenesis (Figure 5A).

"The researchers chose high (PC-3) and low (A549) endogenous total VEGF expressing cell lines for their in vivo assays. To investigate the impact of VEGF 121/165 b isoforms on tumor growth and angiogenesis, the team overexpressed these isoforms in both PC-3 and A549 xenograft models. Western blot analyses revealed that G418-selected cell pools expressed high levels of VEGF121b or VEGF165b. A comparison of tumors overexpressing VEGF121b, VEGF165b or both with the control tumors in PC3 xenografts did not show any significant differences in tumor growth. The only notable difference was a tendency for VEGF121b-overexpressing cells to form larger tumors than the other groups. In contrast, injection of cells overexpressing VEGF121b or VEGF165b into A549 xenografts led to significant increases in tumor volume when compared to control tumors.

Pools of selected cells over a 20-day period using G418 displayed high levels of VEGF121b or VEGF165b, based on Western blot analyses (Figure 6A). Results indicated that in PC3 xenografts, there were no statistical distinctions between control tumors and tumors that overexpressed either or both isoforms. In contrast, VEGF121b-overexpressing cells resulted in a tendency towards more significant tumor formation than other experimental conditions (Figure 6B). Nonetheless, the in vivo studies involving A549 xenografts showed a significant increase in tumor volume when VEGF121b or VEGF165b were administered in comparison to the control group (Figure 6C). Thus, overexpressing VEGF121/165 b isoforms resulted in tumor growth rather than tumor shrinkage in these models."
"The analysis of angiogenesis suggests that the A549 tumors were found to be less angiogenic than the PC-3 tumors. Despite this, there were no differences among the control and experimental groups. VEGF121b-overexpressing tumors in PC-3 showed a higher level of vascularization. The analysis of PDGFRb levels by immunohistochemistry and image analysis did not reveal any decrease in PDGFRb+ cells in either PC-3 or A549 xenografted tumors. Apoptotic cells were also quantified, and the number of active caspase-3+ cells in A549 xenografts did not show any changes. In PC-3 xenografted tumors, no increase, but rather a reduction in the number of apoptotic cells, was observed when VEGFxxxboverexpressing cells were injected compared to controls.","Analysis of angiogenesis indicated that A549 tumors were less angiogenic than PC-3 tumors, and no differences were observed between control and experimental groups. In PC-3 tumors, tumors with VEGF121b-overexpression showed a significant increase in vascularization compared to parental, mock-transfected, and VEGF165b groups. The study also analyzed possible mural recruitment to the vasculature by assessing the levels of PDGFRb via immunohistochemistry and image analysis. However, no significant changes were observed in PDGFRb+ cells in A549 or PC-3 xenografted tumors. The study also quantified apoptotic cells by analyzing the number of active caspase-3+ cells. In A549 tumors, no changes were observed; however, in PC-3 xenografts, VEGFxxxboverexpressing cells showed a reduction in apoptotic cells compared to controls.","The analysis of angiogenesis revealed that A549 tumors showed less angiogenic potential than PC-3 tumors, but there were no observable differences between control and experimental groups.

"From previous studies, it was suggested that VEGFxxxb isoforms may have varying levels of expression in normal and pathological conditions [13]. To investigate whether this was also true for breast cancer, a TMA sample was used containing core biopsies of breast cancer patients and normal breast tissue. A validated antibody that detects total VEGF-A (including all VEGF-A isoforms) was used (R&D systems) in conjunction with the only credible anti-VEGFxxxb antibody that detects all VEGFxxxb proteins (R&D systems) [18]. It's important to note that currently there is no antibody available that is specific to ""non-b"" isoforms (i.e. VEGFxxx).","Prior research has indicated that there may be differential expression of VEGFxxxb isoforms in normal versus pathological conditions [13].

"The images in Figures 8A and 8B display samples of malignant and normal breast tissues which were stained with the anti-VEGFxxxb and anti-total VEGF-A antibodies. VEGFxxxb staining in tumor cells of infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) samples was found to be strong. The staining was also significant in other types of tumors, including papillary carcinoma (Pap), phyllodes (Phy), infiltrating lobular carcinomas (ILC), and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Conversely, VEGFxxxb was not detected in any samples of normal breast tissue (NBT). Additionally, all tissues were positive for total-VEGF-A, including the normal breast epithelium. Evaluation of the staining found that both total-VEGF-A and VEGFxxxb protein levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in IDC compared to normal breast tissues (Figures 8C and 8D). Moreover, there was a strong (p = 0.033) positive correlation index (r = 0.404) between VEGFxxxb and total-VEGF-A, which indicated the degree of co-staining. Therefore, it can be concluded that VEGFxxxb levels are not decreased in malignant breast cancer but instead tend to rise in tumor samples with infiltrating ductal carcinoma having significantly higher levels.","Figures 8A and 8B illustrate images of both malignant and normal breast tissues that were subjected to staining with the anti-VEGFxxxb and anti-total VEGF-A antibodies. The results indicated prominent staining for VEGFxxxb in tumor cells of infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) samples as well as in other types of tumors, such as papillary carcinoma (Pap), phyllodes (Phy), infiltrating lobular carcinomas (ILC) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). No VEGFxxxb was observed in any of the normal breast tissues (NBT). Nonetheless, all tissues analyzed showed positivity for total-VEGF-A, including normal breast epithelium. Semiquantification of staining showed both VEGFxxxb and total VEGF-A protein levels were substantially elevated (p < 0.05) in IDC as opposed to normal breast tissues (Figures 8C and 8D). Moreover, a positive correlation index (r = 0.404) was observed along with a significant (p = 0.033) relationship between VEGFxxxb and total-VEGF-A, indicating the degree of co-staining. Therefore, the findings suggest that VEGFxxxb levels are not lowered in malignant breast cancer; instead, they are inclined to increase in tumor samples and are significantly higher in infiltrating ductal carcinomas.","The representative images in Figures 8A and 8B depict malignant and normal breast tissues that were stained using anti-VEGFxxxb and anti-total VEGF-A antibodies.

"The significance of VEGF-A in normal and pathological angiogenesis has been extensively studied and documented in recent years. VEGF-A has been identified as a crucial target for cancer therapy in solid tumors. Currently, VEGF-targeting agents such as bevacizumab and sunitinib are being used in patients with cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying the production of VEGF-A spliced isoforms remain largely unknown. It may be necessary to understand how the different VEGF-A isoforms are generated through alternative splicing to design more specific and effective molecular therapies.","Over the past few decades, researchers have thoroughly investigated and documented the crucial role of VEGF-A in normal and pathological angiogenesis. Consequently, VEGF-A has emerged as a major target for cancer therapy in solid tumors.

Despite these advancements, our knowledge of the splicing of VEGF-A isoforms remains limited.

"In 2002, scientists reported the existence of a new set of VEGF-A isoforms created through alternative splicing that they named VEGFxxxb isoforms. These isoforms contain a distinct exon (called exon 8b) from the angiogenic transcripts' classical exon 8a, which is called sequence SLTRKD rather than CDKPRR. VEGFxxxb isoforms were thought to be antiangiogenic due to their capacity to bind VEGF-A receptors without significant downstream signaling activation, which was attributed to the inclusion of exon 8b. In tumor cells that were transplanted into nude mice, overexpressing VEGF 165 b or VEGF 121 b resulted in growth inhibition, as was discovered. Another important observation was that VEGFxxxb isoforms may exhibit differential expression in pathological tissues compared to normal tissues, changing the natural splicing to favor VEGFxxx transcripts in some aberrant angiogenesis-linked diseases while decreasing the amount of VEGFxxxb isoforms primarily present in normal tissues.","In 2002, researchers announced the discovery of a new family of VEGF-A isoforms generated by alternative splicing. These isoforms, known as VEGFxxxb isoforms, include a distinct exon, exon 8b, that differs from the classical exon 8a found in angiogenic transcripts, with the former sequence being SLTRKD and the latter sequence being CDKPRR. Incorporating exon 8b is believed to grant VEGFxxxb isoforms the ability to bind VEGF-A receptors without triggering strong downstream signaling activation, hence their hypothesized anti-angiogenic qualities. VEGF 165 b or VEGF 121 b overexpression resulted in growth inhibition when implanted into nude mice's tumor cells, as demonstrated. Additionally, VEGFxxxb isoforms may be expressed differently in pathological tissues than in normal tissues, resulting in changes to natural splicing that favor VEGFxxx transcripts in certain aberrant angiogenesis-linked diseases while decreasing the amount of VEGFxxxb isoforms found mostly in normal tissues.","Researchers reported a novel family of VEGF-A isoforms in 2002, created via alternative splicing, dubbed VEGFxxxb isoforms. These isoforms possess a different exon, exon 8b, which is distinct from the classical exon 8a of angiogenic transcripts, with the former having the SLTRKD sequence and the latter having the CDKPRR sequence. VEGFxxxb isoforms are thought to be anti-angiogenic due to their ability to bind VEGF-A receptors while limiting downstream signaling activation, attributed to the inclusion of exon 8b. When overexpressed in tumor cells of nude mice, VEGF 165 b or VEGF 121 b inhibited growth. Another essential observation is that VEGFxxxb isoforms might undergo distinct expression patterns in pathological tissues relative to normal tissues, favoring VEGFxxx transcripts through natural splicing modification in some angiogenesis-linked diseases while reducing the abundance of VEGFxxxb isoforms mostly expressed in normal tissues."
"In the current investigation, our primary objective was to produce recombinant VEGF 121 b and VEGF165b proteins in the Pichia pastoris yeast with the intention of assessing their potential antiangiogenic and antitumor properties both in vitro and in vivo. We also utilized the PCDNA3.1 plasmid for generating cancer cells that overexpress VEGF121/165b. We selected the yeast expression system for several reasons, including its ability to glycosylate and purify proteins with little contamination from yeast-derived endogenous proteins. Additionally, this system was faster, easier, and more cost-effective compared to mammalian systems. Furthermore, by utilizing this system, we could eliminate the possibility of VEGF-A contamination containing exon 8 and the resulting exons 8 and 8b heterodimer formation since yeasts do not code for any form of VEGF.","The aim of our study was to create VEGF 121 b and VEGF165b recombinant proteins in the yeast Pichia pastoris for the purpose of evaluating their potential antiangiogenic and antitumor properties, both in vivo and in vitro.

The yeast expression system was chosen based on several factors, including its ability to glycosylate proteins and purify them while minimizing the contamination from yeast-derived endogenous proteins that can interfere with the purity of the recombinant protein of interest. Furthermore, the yeast system offered a faster, easier, and more cost-effective protein production process compared to traditional mammalian systems. In addition, we ensured that this expression system did not contain VEGF-A contamination containing exon 8, or any form of VEGF since yeasts do not code for VEGF. This was essential as it helps eliminate the risk of exons 8 and 8b heterodimer formation, since VEGF-A is secreted and active in its dimeric form.","The main objective of our study was to generate VEGF 121 b and VEGF165b recombinant proteins in the yeast Pichia pastoris to explore their potential antitumor and antiangiogenic properties in vitro and in vivo.

Firstly, it has the ability to glycosylate proteins and purify them without contaminating proteins from yeast. Moreover, it enables faster, more efficient and cheaper protein production than traditional mammalian system. In addition, this expression system prevents the presence of exon 8-containing VEGF-A contamination which can lead to exons 8 and 8b heterodimer formation, since yeasts do not have any form of VEGF. Since VEGF-A is active in its dimeric form, this is of particular importance."
"Recombinant forms of VEGF121b and VEGF165b were created successfully, which possess similar structural characteristics to the traditional VEGF121 and VEGF165 proteins. These proteins have the capability to create dimers or multimers and react with commercial antibodies created specifically for exons 1 to 5, which are shared by all VEGF-A isoforms.

Additionally, the recombinant proteins displayed immunoreactivity with a credible antibody that acknowledges exon 8b, which was created by R&D."
"To test the functionality of the isoforms in vitro, the researchers treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with recombinant proteins produced in yeasts, VEGF165 b produced in mammalian cells, or the ""classical"" VEGF165 angiogenic protein, as a control. The treatments were all conducted in serum-free media. The results showed that VEGF121/165b isoforms caused HUVECs to proliferate and induced phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and ERK, a downstream transducer. Although the effect of VEGF121/165b was weaker than VEGF165, the degree of ERK activation was similar for all proteins tested 10 minutes after stimulation.

"VEGF165b has unique functional characteristics as shown by Kawamura et al. [16]. They found that VEGF165b is a weaker agonist of VEGFR2 compared to VEGF145, but can still phosphorylate VEGFR2 in HUVECs. Like VEGF121, VEGF165b does not bind neuropilin-1 (NRP1) or induce complexes between NRP1 and VEGFR2. It promotes cell migration, but does not induce endothelial sprout formation. VEGF165b cannot phosphorylate mouse VEGFR2 at Y1052, and it may prevent transphosphorylation by partially blocking receptor's intracellular tail rotation upon binding. Glass et al.

"To validate the angiogenic properties of VEGF 121/165b observed in in vitro tests, we conducted in vivo experiments with Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel, which has considerably lower levels of angiogenic cytokines, including VEGF. The addition of recombinant VEGF 121 b, VEGF 165 b, or VEGF 165 to the Matrigel increased the recruitment of blood vessels compared to the PBS-loaded control group, thereby demonstrating an angiogenic effect. It's worth noting that the Matrigels containing VEGF121b exhibited significantly high levels of dextran-FITC signals both inside and outside the vessels, similar to those found for bFGF.

"During our study, we sought to determine if overexpressing VEGF121/165b in xenograft models could inhibit tumor growth in vivo. To achieve this, we picked the A549 cell line, a low-VEGF-expressing lung adenocarcinoma that secretes ~1-5 pg/mL, and the PC-3, a prostate cancer cell line that secretes ~800 pg/mL. Our goal was to analyze any possible variations in the VEGFxxxb behavior depending on the endogenous VEGF expression levels. We executed experiments without any additional exogenous VEGF stimulation, such as transfecting VEGF. Although we did not find any noteworthy differences between control and VEGF121/165b-expressing PC3 xenografts, we did observe a tendency for VEGF121b-overexpressing tumors to grow at a faster rate than the other groups. Vascular density for VEGF121b-overexpressing PC-3 tumors was significantly higher than observed for the rest of the groups, and there were significantly lower apoptotic levels. A549 xenografts formed small tumors and grew slowly after subcutaneous implantation in nude mice, which agrees with previous studies [30].","To investigate the tumor growth inhibition ability of VEGF121/165b overexpression in vivo, we conducted tests utilizing xenograft models.

"Despite previous studies suggesting that VEGF 165 b possesses anti-tumor effects, the results of this research contradict this claim. The reason for this discrepancy may be due to variations in VEGF expression in different in vivo models used in previous research. In models where VEGF is expressed at high levels, overexpression of VEGFxxxb and VEGFxxx proteins result in equal competition for receptor binding, leading to reduced tumor growth with VEGFxxxb overexpression. However, in models with low VEGF expression, overexpression of VEGFxxxb could actually enhance tumor growth to some extent. This hypothesis is supported by the findings that no difference in tumor growth between parental and VEGF165b-overexpressing CAKI cells was observed when VEGF levels were around 900 pg/mL.","The present study contradicts prior research indicating that VEGF 165 b has anti-tumor properties. The authors propose that differences in the levels of VEGF expression in various in vivo models may account for this contradiction. In models where VEGF expression is high, VEGFxxxb and VEGFxxx proteins compete equally for receptor binding, resulting in reduced tumor growth when VEGFxxxb is overexpressed. Conversely, when tumors have low VEGF production, overexpression of VEGFxxxb could potentially promote tumor growth to some extent. This hypothesis appears to be supported by the fact that there was no notable difference in tumor growth between parental and VEGF 165 b-transfected CAKI cells, which had VEGF levels of approximately 900 pg/mL.","The contradictory findings of this study to prior reports that suggest VEGF 165 b has anti-tumor effects are noteworthy. The authors offer an explanation that the in vivo models used in the previous research expressed high VEGF levels, either from the nature of the cells employed, or by transfection with VEGF-carrying plasmids. In these conditions, VEGFxxxb isoforms have shown to reduce tumor growth through competing equally with VEGFxxx for receptor binding. However, since VEGFxxxb has a weaker signaling ability, overexpression of VEGFxxxb can stimulate tumor growth to an extent in low VEGF production tumors. In support of this hypothesis, the study results found no difference in tumor growth between parental and VEGF165b-overexpressing CAKI cells when VEGF levels were around 900 pg/mL. Only when parental cells were transfected with VEGF 165 was a reduction in tumor volume observed as compared to VEGF165b-overexpressing tumors."
"It is conceivable that VEGFxxxb protein treatments might prove effective as a therapeutic approach in tumors that exhibit high levels of VEGF expression of an endogenous nature. Despite this, the application of such treatments in instances of tumors exhibiting low VEGF levels that rely on other angiogenic factors, which may include bFGF, IL-8 and similar elements, for their growth, could potentially serve to exacerbate rather than ameliorate the progression of the tumor. Consequently, administering VEGFxxxb protein as a therapeutic intervention raises some uncertainties regarding its utilization among patients who might not be suitable. It is, therefore, essential to take caution while identifying individuals who might benefit from VEGFxxxb-based therapies, doing so through a process of patient stratification based on VEGF production levels. This forms a critical aspect that future clinical trials will have to take into consideration.","The administration of VEGFxxxb proteins as a therapeutic for tumors with high endogenous VEGF expression may be effective. However, for tumors with low VEGF levels that rely on other factors like bFGF, IL-8 for growth, using VEGFxxxb therapy may potentially worsen the disease's progression. Therefore, the possibility of using VEGFxxxb therapy on unselected patients is questionable, and caution is required in defining which patients could benefit from VEGFxxxb-based therapies. It is vital to identify the amount of VEGF production in patients and stratify them accordingly, making it a critical aspect to consider for conducting potential clinical trials.","The effectiveness of therapies based on VEGFxxxb proteins can be higher in tumors exhibiting excessive endogenous VEGF expression. But the therapy's administration in tumors with low VEGF levels, which primarily rely on other angiogenic factors such as bFGF, IL-8 for growth, could negatively affect their disease progression. Hence, using VEGFxxxb as a therapeutic approach raises doubts about its wider applicability in patients. It is imperative to exercise caution and determine patients that could benefit from treatments using VEGFxxxb-based therapies. A critical aspect of future clinical trials is to stratify patients based on their VEGF production level to identify those who can benefit from VEGFxxxb-based therapies."
"The VEGFxxxb biology needs to be understood before therapy translation can occur. It is surprising that VEGF121b not only prompted endothelial cell migration inhibition, but also provided cytoprotection for the cells in serum starvation experiments. The protection was enabled by the activation of VEGF receptors and downstream signalling, behaving similarly to VEGF165. VEGF165 co-expression with VEGF165b led to smaller tumors in some xenograft models than when VEGF165b was overexpressed alone. It remains unclear whether the VEGFxxxb proteins can heterodimerize with other members of the VEGFxxx angiogenic family, and this question needs answering.","Prior to the translation of therapy involving VEGFxxxb, there are several aspects of its biology that must be elucidated. One of these is the unexpected finding that while VEGF121b is known to inhibit the migration of endothelial cells, it is also cytoprotective for these cells under serum starvation conditions by activating VEGF receptors and downstream signalling, similarly to VEGF165. Moreover, the co-expression of VEGF165 and VEGF165b in some xenograft models results in smaller tumors compared to overexpression of only VEGF165b. Additionally, further research is necessary to determine whether VEGFxxxb proteins can heterodimerize with members of the VEGFxxx angiogenic family.","A thorough understanding of the VEGFxxxb biology is essential prior to the translation of this type of therapy. It is surprising that the activation of VEGF receptors and downstream signalling by VEGF121b results in cytoprotection for endothelial cells and inhibits their migration, similar to the effect of VEGF165. Co-expression of VEGF165 and VEGF165b in xenograft models leads to smaller tumors compared to overexpression of only VEGF165b. There is a need to determine whether VEGFxxxb proteins can combine with other members of the VEGFxxx angiogenic family. These are some questions that should be clarified before initiating therapy translation involving VEGFxxxb."
"In this study, we investigated whether there is a difference in the expression of VEGFxxxb isoforms between malignant tissues (human breast cancer) and healthy tissues (normal mammary gland). We utilized immunohistochemistry experiments with validated antibodies that target all VEGFxxxb isoforms and antibodies that recognize all VEGF transcripts. Our results showed that there is a tendency for both total VEGF and VEGFxxxb to increase in breast cancer tissues (n = 50) compared to normal tissue (n = 8), with statistically significant increases seen in intraductal carcinomas (IDC). Furthermore, the expression of total VEGF and VEGFxxxb was significantly correlated, suggesting that both families of VEGF may be expressed similarly.","The objective of this study was to explore whether the expression of VEGFxxxb isoforms is different in malignant tissues (human breast cancer) compared to healthy tissues (normal mammary gland). Immunohistochemistry experiments were conducted using validated antibodies specific for all VEGFxxxb isoforms and antibodies capable of recognizing all VEGF transcripts. Our results demonstrated that both total VEGF and VEGFxxxb levels tended to increase in breast cancer samples (n = 50) when compared to normal breast samples (n = 8), with intraductal carcinomas (IDC) showing a statistically significant rise. Expression levels of both total VEGF and VEGFxxxb were strongly correlated, implying that the expression patterns of both VEGF subfamilies (VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb) may be comparable.","The purpose of this study was to determine whether VEGFxxxb isoform expression differs in malignant tissue (human breast cancer) compared to healthy tissue (normal mammary gland). We employed immunohistochemistry experiments with verified antibodies specific to all VEGFxxxb isoforms and antibodies that recognize all VEGF transcripts. Our findings showed that both total VEGF and VEGFxxxb levels had a tendency to increase in breast cancer samples (n = 50) relative to normal breast tissue samples (n = 8), and this was significantly noticeable in intraductal carcinomas (IDC). The levels of both total VEGF and VEGFxxxb were significantly related, indicating that the expression of both VEGF families (VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb) may follow a similar pattern."
"The extent of VEGFxxxb isoform expression was limitedly investigated in the prior studies. The data showed that the increase in total VEGF mRNA levels was due to the VEGFxxx angiogenic isoform, and no significant changes were observed in the VEGFxxxb mRNA levels in colon carcinoma samples, as compared to controls. By using an isoform-specific ELISAs, a similar result was obtained for protein levels. Besides, RT-PCR analysis of normal and malignant tissues indicated the presence of VEGF165b in all normal kidney samples and only in four matched malignant tissues. The neoplastic tissue of melanoma samples, when analyzed using a VEGFxxxb-specific antibody, showed a reduction in VEGFxxxb expression relative to the normal skin. This decrease was more pronounced in metastatic melanoma samples than non-metastatic ones.","Previous research has only looked at the expression of VEGFxxxb isoforms in a limited number of samples. Total VEGF mRNA levels were found to be significantly upregulated in colon carcinoma samples compared to controls. However, there were no changes observed for VEGFxxxb mRNA levels. The upsurge in total VEGF appears to be due to the presence of VEGFxxx angiogenic isoforms. This was also demonstrated through isoform-specific ELISAs that showed protein levels were similar. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated VEGF165b to be present in most normal kidney samples, but only in four of the 18 paired malignant tissues examined. Immunohistochemical analysis of neoplastic vs. normal skin found by VEGFxxxb-specific antibody showed that VEGFxxxb expression was reduced in neoplastic tissues, particularly in metastatic melanoma samples.","Studies carried out in the past analyzed the expression of VEGFxxxb isoforms, but only in a small number of samples. In colon carcinoma samples, it was discovered that total VEGF mRNA levels were markedly increased compared to controls, but VEGFxxxb mRNA levels remained unchanged. This indicates that the rise in total VEGF levels is due to the presence of VEGFxxx angiogenic isoforms. Tests carried out with isoform-specific ELISAs produced a similar result. The RT-PCR analysis of normal and malignant tissues showed that VEGF165b was present in all normal kidney samples and only in four of the 18 paired malignant tissues examined. The results of immunohistochemical analysis of neoplastic tissue compared to normal skin using a VEGFxxxb-specific antibody showed that the expression of VEGFxxxb was reduced in neoplastic tissues and particularly, in metastatic melanoma samples."
"Assessing the expression patterns of VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb proteins in malignant and normal tissues is problematic as there are no antibodies that are specific for each protein type. To establish whether VEGFxxxb expression is a viable biomarker for cancer, upcoming research that makes use of a larger number of samples, as well as quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses, will be necessary.","The inability to find suitable antibodies that are specific to both VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb proteins makes it difficult to fully characterize their expression patterns in malignant and normal tissues. To determine the viability of using VEGFxxxb expression as a cancer biomarker, further studies involving a higher number of samples and employing quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses are required.","Adequate antibodies that are specific to each type of VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb proteins are not readily available, which hampers the precise evaluation of their expression patterns in malign and standard tissues. To determine whether VEGFxxxb expression could serve as a viable biomarker for malignancy, future research utilizing a larger sample size, quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and immunohistochemical analysis would be necessary."
"The report reveals that VEGF121/165b are not antiangiogenic, but feeble pro-angiogenic versions of VEGF-A that may prompt the progression of tumors and angiogenesis in vivo. The study also suggests that VEGFxxxb isoforms, as well as total VEGF levels, exhibit increased expression in breast cancer when compared to non-cancerous breast tissue.","The results demonstrate that VEGF121/165b are not anti-angiogenic, but instead are slightly pro-angiogenic forms of VEGF-A that may aid in tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. Additionally, it was concluded that VEGFxxxb isoforms (as well as total VEGF levels) are up-regulated in breast cancer in comparison to non-cancerous breast tissues, according to the study.","The study findings demonstrate that VEGF121/165b are not anti-angiogenic, rather they are weakly pro-angiogenic versions of VEGF-A that may promote tumor development and angiogenesis in vivo.

"In the quest to create vaccines for different pathogens, DNA vaccines have been widely studied. Research shows that DNA vaccines can generate both cellular and humoral immune responses [4]. Some studies have found that they are effective in producing protective immune responses to various viruses [5,6]. However, one of the challenges faced by DNA vaccines is that they cannot generate immune responses in mice when given through the intranasal (i.n.) route [7]. Since most respiratory diseases enter the body through the mucosal surface, it is crucial to develop a vaccine that stimulates both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Mucosal immune responses, which rely heavily on secretory IgA, serve as a first-line defense mechanism against influenza virus infections. Although parenteral immunization is not adequate to generate protective immunity, mucosal immune responses are essential [9].","DNA vaccines have been extensively researched in the development of immunization against various pathogens. Studies have shown that these vaccines can induce both cellular and humoral immune responses [4], and some have also reported protective immune responses against multiple viruses [5,6]. One challenge with DNA vaccines is their inability to stimulate immune responses in mice when delivered through the intranasal route [7]. Given that mucosal surfaces are the primary entry site for most respiratory diseases, vaccines that elicit both mucosal and systemic immune responses are ideal. Mucosal immune responses play a crucial role as the frontline defense against influenza virus infections, and secretory IgA plays an essential role in this immune response [8]. While parenteral immunization alone is not sufficient to generate protective immunity, inducing mucosal immune responses is critical to achieving protective immunity [9].","Research efforts to develop vaccines against various pathogens have concentrated on DNA vaccines. These vaccines have shown promise in triggering both cellular and humoral immune responses [4].

As most respiratory diseases enter the body through the mucosal surface, there is a need for vaccines that can elicit both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Mucosal immune responses play a vital role as the first line of defense against influenza virus infections, with secretory IgA playing a crucial role in mediating these defenses [8]. Parenteral immunization is inadequate in generating protective immunity, highlighting the importance of inducing mucosal immune responses [9]."

"To evaluate how PEI impacts the adaptive immunity response to SARS-CoV S protein, mice were given an intranasal SARS-CoV DNA vaccine, and their specific antibody responses were measured. The results showed that the group of mice that received PEI/pci-S complexes produced high levels of SARS-CoV S-specific serum IgG antibody, while those that only received SARS-CoV S DNA did not show the same response (Figure 2A).

"Dendritic cells (DCs) critically contribute to inducing antigen-specific immune responses. These cells can be found in different tissues representing one of the primary sentinel cells [21]. While recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns from microorganisms, DCs undergo a maturation process that endows them the ability for antigen presentation. This maturation process also increases the expression of essential immune molecules, such as MHC proteins, cytokines, and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD83, and CD86 [22], [23] and [24]. Therefore, the appropriate maturation of DCs is required for suitable activation of adaptive immunity [22]. Intranasal immunization with PEI/pci-S complexes has shown to induce the maturation of DCs in cervical lymph nodes, increasing the expression of co-stimulatory and MHC class II molecules.","The induction of antigen-specific immune responses is largely dependent on the critical role played by dendritic cells (DCs).

"CD4+ and CD8+ T cells mediate cellular immune responses which produce cytokines, such as IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-2, and IL-17, after in vitro re-stimulation with SARS spike peptides. These cytokines have different functions, such as activating macrophages and DCs, inhibiting viral infection, regulating immune cells and inhibiting viral replication, and mediating the expansion of memory T cells and the production of antimicrobial peptides and immunoglobulin to neutralize viral infections. Studies reveal that antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secrete IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-2, and IL-17 in lung tissues after vaccination with PEI/pci-S. Multi-cytokine producing cells likely contribute to protection against SARS-CoV infection after vaccination. Previous studies showed that multi-cytokine producing T cells are more efficient than single-cytokine producing cells for protection against Leishmania major infections.","Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play a role in cellular immune responses that are mediated by cytokines, including IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-2, and IL-17, secreted after SARS spike peptide restimulation. IFN-g activates macrophages and DCs and inhibits viral infections, TNF-a inhibits viral replication and regulates immune cells, IL-2 maintains memory T cells and promotes T cell expansion, and IL-17 mediates the production of antimicrobial peptides to neutralize viral infections. Research indicates that antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells produce these cytokines in non-lymphoid tissues, such as the lung, after vaccination with PEI/pci-S. Multi-cytokine producing cells are increased, and these cells are likely responsible for protection against SARS-CoV infection after vaccination. Multi-cytokine producing antigen-specific CD4+ T cells have been shown to be functionally superior in disease protection than single-cytokine producing cells, as seen in protection against Leishmania major infection in other studies.","CD4+ and CD8+ T cells stimulate cellular immune responses that produce cytokines, such as IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-2, and IL-17, following in vitro restimulation with SARS spike peptides. These cytokines have various impacts, such as activating macrophages and DCs, inhibiting viral infections, modulating immune cells, and inhibiting viral replication. IL-2 promotes memory T cells and T cell expansion, and IL-17 promotes the production of antimicrobial peptides to counteract viral infections. Studies demonstrate that antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells release IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-2, and IL-17 in non-lymphoid tissues, such as the lungs, after receiving PEI/pci-S vaccination. Multiple-cytokine generating cells are increased in mice immunized with PEI/pci-S, and these cells are possibly responsible for protection against SARS-CoV infection post-vaccination. Studies indicate that multi-cytokine secreting antigen-specific CD4+ T cells are superior in disease protection compared to single-cytokine producing cells. These cells have been shown to correlate with protection against Leishmania major infection in several reports."
