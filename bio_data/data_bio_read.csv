1,1,"Neurogenesis is a strictly controlled process generating and maintaining the complex CNS cytoarchitecture. In the adult brain, neurogenesis constitutes in addition a form of cellular neuronal plasticity by continuously generating new neurons from resident neural stem cells (NSCs). Neurogenesis progresses through several sequential events, including proliferation, neuronal lineage restriction of precursors, cell cycle exit, migration and integration into target area, differentiation, as well as morphological and functional maturation. At the end of this process, newly generated cells can be found as functionally integrated and active neurons [1-3]. Neuronal precursors and newly generated neurons can be identified by their expression of doublecortin (DCX) [4,5]. In the adult CNS, expression of DCX is mainly detected in the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the subventricular zone/rostral migration stream/olfactory bulb axis (SVZ/RMS/OB) [4,6-8]. Based on the close association between DCX expression and neurogenesis [5], we previously generated transgenic mice, to monitor neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo, in which reporter genes were driven by the DCX promoter [9-13].",1
1,2,"The potential of involving adult neurogenesis in therapeutic strategies to replace pathological neuronal losses urges for a better understanding of neurogenesis at the molecular and cellular levels. In addition, accumulating evidence indicates that abnormal neurogenesis might be involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders [14-16]. Therefore, to understand and dissect the molecular mechanisms driving neurogenesis in vivo, various models have been developed over the last years. For example, transgenic models have been generated based on cell-type specific promoters such as nestin, GLAST, PLP (proteolipid protein), or DCX to investigate the biology of neural stem cells, radial glia, oligodendroglial precursors and neuronal precursors, respectively [11,17-21]. However, these reporter mice are not suitable for long-term studies such as fate tracing or studies on the long-term functional integration of the newly generated neurons. For example, in the SVZ/OB axis and in the dentate gyrus DCX is expressed in newly generated neurons only transiently (mostly less than 1 month in rodents’ DG and OB) [4], and thus, the DCX reporter mice are not applicable for fate mapping studies.",1
1,3,"To remedy this absence of suitable tool for neuronal precursor fate analysis, we generated transgenic mice bearing the tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase gene under the control of the DCX promoter. In this report, we demonstrate that this new transgenic tool allows for time-resolved permanent labeling of newly generated neurons and long-term analysis of their fate. Moreover, it provides a platform to induce and eliminate expression of genes in a crucial time window of neuronal maturation and study the functional consequences of these manipulations.",1
1,4,"A 2380-bp Sal I-Not I fragment of pCAG-CreERT2bpA-SS1 vector containing the CreERT2 cDNA was subcloned into the BamH I and Not I site of the phuDCX-3509-DsRed2 cassette [9], which contains the promoter region of human DCX, resulting in the phuDCX-3509-CreERT2 (Additional file 1). A 7.7-kb DCX-3’UTR (3’UTR) was amplified with RT-PCR, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen Kit; catalog No. 11904-018). PCR amplifications were performed with the sense primer 5’-ACTAGTAAGATGATAGGCTAAATCAAAGCC-3’ and antisense primer 5’-GCGGCCGCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTATTGAAATCAAATTTTAT-3’. The Spe I and Not I sites were inserted in the 5’ terminal of primers respectively (the italic sequences with underlines). PCR products were cloned into a pCRII vector (TOPO TA Cloning Kit; Invitrogen; catalog No. K4600-01) to obtain the pCRIITOPO-3’UTR plasmid. A 7.7-kb Spe I-Not I fragment of pCRII-TOPO-3’UTR was subcloned into the Spe I and Not I site of the phuDCX-3509-CreERT2 cassette to get the phuDCX-3509-CreERT2-3’UTR targeting plasmid.",1
1,5,"The targeting plasmid, phuDCX-3509-CreERT2-3’-UTR, was linearized by digestion with Sal I-Not I. The purified linearized DNA was microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized oocytes of FVB inbred mice. Genotypes of the offspring were determined by PCR analysis and Southern Blot of tail DNA. An initial screen of the offspring was performed via PCR analysis with Cre sense primer 5’-TGCATTACCGGTCGATGCAAC-3’ and the antisense primer 5’-GAAATCAGTGCGTTCGAACGCTAGA-3’. Cre-positive mice were further analyzed with Southern Blot (Additional file 1). A 1.27-kb Sal I-Hind III fragment of pCAG-CreERT2-bpA-SS1 vector was employed for preparing the probe with random primer (GE Healthcare Kit; catalog No. RPN 1633), the labeling probe was purified with MicroSpin S-300 HR (GE Healthcare Kit; catalog No. 27-5130-01) following the manufacturer’s instructions. In case of positive insertion this probe detects a 7424 bp fragment after digestion of the genomic DNA with Kpn I, or two fragments after digestion with EcoR V (the size of one fragment is 8415 bp and the other at least is over 4103 bp). (All restriction enzymes are from Roche Applied Science).",1
1,6,"Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the Council of European Communities Directive of the 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC) and approved by the HelmholtzZentrum Munich Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. To expand the DCXCreERT2 transgenic mouse line, DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice were backcrossed with wildtype C57Bl/6J mice. DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice were in addition mated with two reporter lines: CAG-CAT-EGFP mice [22] or ROSA26lacZ mice [23] to obtain DCX-CreERT2: ROSA26lacZ or DCX-CreERT2:CAG-CAT-EGFP double transgenic mice. Recombination activity in these lines induces expression of the corresponding reporter gene and was used for the various analyses described hereafter.",1
1,7,"Tamoxifen (TAM, T-5648, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in corn oil (C-8267, Sigma-Aldrich) at a stock concentration of 10 mg/ml. To analyze the expression of CreERT2 or reporter genes in embryonic stages 20 μg TAM/g bodyweight was injected once intraperitoneally (i.p.) into pregnant mothers at different gestational stages. One day after the TAM injection, embryos were dissected for whole-mount X-Gal staining or immunostaining. To follow the fate of cells targeted at embryonic stages during adulthood, the same protocol of TAM injection was employed in pregnant females of 17.5 day gestational stage, and the offspring was sacrificed at 2 months of age. To identify whether the CreERT2 recombination can be activated with a single TAM injection in adult brain (8 to 10 week-old), one dose of 200 μg TAM/g bodyweight was injected (i.p.) and mice were analyzed 1 day later. Finally, study of the expression patterns of CreERT2, reporter genes and cell-type specific markers in the adult brain was realized by injecting daily 100 μg TAM/g bodyweight (i.p.) for 5 consecutive days. These mice were analyzed 2 days (D2), 8 days (D8), 15 days (D15), or 29 days (D29) after the last TAM injection.",1
1,8,"Twenty-four hours prior to perfusion, mice were injected with 200 μg/g bodyweight BrdU (5-Bromo-2’deoxyuridine; B5002; Sigma-Aldrich) prepared in sterile PBS, pH7.4.",1
1,9,"For whole-mount X-gal staining, embryos were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2 in PBS solution for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT). They were then rinsed in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 (PB), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% NP-40, and incubated with X-gal staining buffer (0.1% X-gal, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% NP-40, 5 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mM K4Fe(CN)6 in PB) for several hours in the dark at 37°C to visualize the beta-galactosidase (b-gal) activity as a blue reaction product. Stained embryos were washed twice in PBS and post-fixed with 4% PFA in PBS overnight at 4°C. X-gal staining of free floating sections was carried out as described above, with the modification that sections were post-fixed with 4% PFA in PBS only 1 h at RT, and then lightly counterstained with Eosin Y (0.1%, E4382, Sigma-Aldrich).",1
1,10,"Embryos for immunohistology were fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.5 for 2-8 hrs. Thereafter the whole embryo was embedded in paraffin, and sagittally sectioned (8 μm) using a Microm HM 355 s Microtome (Leica). Brains of adult mice were removed after transcardial perfusion with 4% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.5. Brains were post-fixed for 2 hours in the same fixative. Thereafter, brains were immersed in 20% sucrose at 4°C overnight and embedded in OCT compound. Brains were sectioned using a Leica cryostat into serial coronal or sagittal sections (40 μm) for a systematic sampling of the entire brain.",1
1,11,"For immunofluorescence staining, free-floating sections were rinsed with PBS and blocked with PBS++ (PBS++: 5% fetal calf serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h at RT. However, in cases of staining involving the detection of BrdU, sections were pretreated in 2 N HCl at 37°C for 30 min, followed by a 10 min neutralization in 0.1 M borate buffer and six washes in PBS prior to blocking. Then they were incubated in PBS++ containing primary antibody dilutions (see Table 1) for 24 hours at 4°C, followed by three 10 min washes in PBS. Sections were then incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to cyanine 2 (cy2), cy3 or cy5 diluted in PBS++ for 2 h at RT (1:400, Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab). After three 10 min washes in PBS, sections were incubated with 5 mg/ml 4’,6’-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (SigmaAldrich, D9564) for 20 min, followed by three 5 min washes in PBS. Finally, sections were mounted with Aqua poly/Mount (Polysciences, 18606).",1
1,12,A minimum of 100 positive cells per region of interest in each animal and for each time point were counted to quantify the recombination events. Data are presented as mean ± SD.,1
1,13,"We previously demonstrated that a 3509-bp DCX genomic fragment could properly drive expression of reporter genes in neuronal precursors and immature neurons in vitro and in vivo [9,10]. Therefore, the CreERT2 encoding sequences were subcloned downstream of this DCX regulatory fragment (Additional file 1). Two male founders carrying the CreERT2 transgene were obtained after pronuclear injection. Both founders transmitted their transgene to the F1 generation and Southern blot analysis suggested that only 1 copy of the transgene was integrated into the host genome (Additional file 1).",1
1,14,"Cre-recombinase activity was assessed on the F1 generation of both founder-derived lines following mating with Rosa26 lacZ reporter mice bearing a lacZ expression cassette activated following recombination [23]. Two month-old DCX-CreERT2:Rosa26 lacZ mice were perfused two weeks after a tamoxifen (TAM) or vehicle injection and stained for b-gal activity. Both DCX-CreERT2 transgenic lines exhibited the expected TAM-induced b-gal expression in the adult neurogenic regions, i.e. SVZ and dentate gyrus (Additional file 1). In contrast, no b-gal activity was observed following vehicle injections in the progeny derived from founder 2. However, in mice derived from founder 1, numerous b-gal positive profiles could be detected after vehicle injection indicating unspecific recombination events (data not shown). Therefore, only the transgenic DCXCreERT2 founder 2 line was expanded and employed for the following experiments.",1
1,15,"To validate that CreERT2 expression coincides with endogenous DCX expression in the DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice, we investigated their respective expression patterns. At the cellular level, CreERT2 was detected in virtually all DCX+ cells of the developing CNS (E15.5). Furthermore, one day after injection of TAM, the CreERT2 has been translocated to the nucleus (Figure 1a). Similarly, in the adult brain, CreERT2 expression was, one day after TAM injection, strictly restricted to the nucleus of DCX+ cells (Figure 1b). Nuclear localization is induced by TAM administration and is a prerequisite for CreERT2 activity [24].",1
1,16,"To determine the time window in which CreERT2 exerts its function in the nucleus after the TAM injection, DCX-CreERT2 adult mice were perfused at different time points post-injection and the sub-cellular localization of the CreERT2 was assessed. Seven days after TAM injection, the nuclear localization was dramatically decreased as compared to the first day. At this time point, CreERT2 expression was still co-localized with DCX, but its distribution returned to be mostly cytoplasmic (Figure 1c). Furthermore, two weeks after TAM injection, CreERT2 was exclusively localized in the cytoplasm (Figure 1d and 1e). Taken together, our results indicate that the CreERT2 nuclear localization rapidly recedes after the last TAM administration, indicating that CreERT2 activity was transient and virtually ceased after 7 days.",1
1,17,"Having confirmed the correct co-localization of CreERT2 with DCX+ cells, we then analyzed recombination activity and specificity. To this end, we mated DCX-CreERT2 mice with Rosa26 lacZ or CAG-CATEGFP reporter mice, which allow to monitor the activation of the respective reporter gene expression, following successful excision of the loxP-flanked cassette. The fate of DCX-expressing cells can then be followed by analyzing reporter gene expression at various time points following recombination.",1
1,18,"The CreERT2 activity at embryonic stages was analyzed first. Twenty-four hours after a single TAM injection performed on E14.5, X-gal staining revealed that b-gal expression was restricted to the developing CNS and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) (Figure 2). This distribution coincided with the pattern of endogenous DCX expression at this stage (Figure 2a). Activation of CreERT2 at E17.5 by a single TAM-injection led to a wide distribution of EGFP reporter expression in the adult brain (Figure 2d to 2k and Additional file 2). EGFP+ cells were detected in most regions of the brain parenchyma, such as in the granular cell layer of dentate gyrus, striatum, cortex, thalamus, Ammon’s horn (CA1), etc. according to DCX expression pattern at E17.5.",1
1,19,"Noteworthy, virtually all EGFP+ cells expressed NeuN, and thus had become mature neurons (Figure 2d to 2g). EGFP expression was neither detected in DCX-positive cells in the SVZ (Figure 2f and 2g), nor in the rostral migrating stream (RMS) (data not shown) and subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (Figure 2d and 2e). A few EGFP+ cells could be found in or in close association to the ependymal layer of the lateral ventricles (Figure 2f, arrows). These EGFP+ cells, however, did neither co-express NeuN nor DCX and their nature remains to be elucidated.",1
1,20,"Due to the lower numbers of neurons continuously generated in the adult CNS, adult mice were injected with TAM on 5 consecutive days and then perfused for analysis 4 weeks after the last injection. At this time point, SVZ-generated EGFP+ cells reached the OB and were distributed mainly within the granular cell layer (GrO) (Figure 2h and 2i) and to a lower extent in the periglomerular cell layer (pGl). The EGFP+ cells present in the OB were found to express the mature neuronal marker NeuN, whereas no co-expression of DCX could be detected (Figure 2h and 2i). Within the rostral RMS in contrast, a few scattered EGFP-expressing cells appeared to have retained expression of DCX. Moreover, only rare EGFP+ cells could be found in the SVZ (data not shown). Similarly to cells detected in the OB, four weeks after TAM administration, EGFP+ cells in the dentate gyrus expressed NeuN and were devoid of DCX (Figure 2j and 2k).",1
1,21,"The efficiency and the specificity of the recombination event in DCX-expressing cells were evaluated in the adult SVZ and SGZ. The percentage of all DCX+ cells expressing EGFP was defined as the efficiency of recombination, and the percentage of all EGFP+ cells expressing DCX was defined as the specificity. Since levels of accumulated EGFP within cells were relatively low at the earliest time point studied, EGFP signals were amplified using an anti-EGFP antibody in all following experiments. In the SVZ, we observed that approximately 94% DCX+ cells were co-expressing EGFP two days after the last TAM injection (Figure 3c and 3o). At the same time point in the SGZ of the dentate gyrus, EGFP could be detected in approximately 77% of DCX-expressing cells (Figure 3d and 3o). Moreover, approximately 96% EGFP+ cells in SVZ and 90% EGFP+ cells in SGZ (Figure 3p) were co-expressing DCX, demonstrating that the CreERT2 activity was highly efficient and specific.",1
1,22,"In order to characterize further the kinetics of the DCX+ cells’ emigration from their site of birth to their target structures, the distribution of EGFP-expressing cells following recombination was investigated over time. To this end, adult mice were sacrificed eight, fifteen or twenty-nine days after the last TAM injection (D8, D15 and D29, respectively). Co-localization of EGFP expression with DCX and NeuN was analyzed within the SVZ-RMS-OB axis and within the dentate gyrus at these time points.",1
1,23,"In contrast to the high percentage of EGFP-expression within DCX+ cells two days after the last TAM injection, the percentage of EGFP-expressing DCX+ neurons in the SGZ decreased to 41% at D8, and declined gradually to roughly 25% of all DCX+ cells at D15 (Figure 3). Concomitantly, the frequency of co-localization in the SVZ decreased at D8 to 26.7%, further diminished to 12.5% at D15 (Figure 3). Finally, at D29, only rare EGFP+ cells remained within the SVZ and were found to express DCX, whereas no co-localization could be detected in the SGZ at this time point. Taken together, our data indicate that the main emigration wave of EGFP-labeled neurons departed away from the SVZ within the first 15 days (Figure 3).",1
1,24,"EGFP+ cells migrating along the RMS from D2 to D15 were found to maintain an immature neuronal morphology and only rare co-localization with NeuN could be documented (Figure 4). Over the next 4 weeks, expression of NeuN within EGFP+ cells was broadly induced as cells reached the GrO or the pGl of the olfactory bulb (Figure 2h and 2i, Figure 4 a, e and 4i). Notably, in the GrO, we found only weak expression of DCX in EGFP+ cells. In contrast, DCX was still strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of EGFP+ located at the anterior end of the RMS (Figure 2i, arrow), revealing that the expression of DCX decreased gradually as EGFP+ cells migrated into their target areas (data not shown). These observations reveal that DCX expression in cells migrating to the olfactory bulb is regionally regulated. In a similar fashion, EGFP-expressing cells in the dentate gyrus integrated in the inner granular layer over time and gradually induced the expression of NeuN. Quantitative analyses revealed that 15 days after the last TAM administration, more than 80% of EGFP+ cells found in the dentate gyrus (Figure 4m) and virtually all EGFP+ cells found in the olfactory bulb (data not shown) expressed the mature neuronal marker NeuN.",1
1,25,"To further characterize the neuronal phenotypes of EGFP-labeled neurons, the presence of neurotransmitter-specific markers and calcium-binding proteins was investigated by immunohistology at D29 (Figure 5). In agreement with previous studies [25,26], expression of GAD65, a marker found in GABAergic neurons, could be detected at this time point in EGFP-expressing cells located in the OB. Moreover, a sub-population of periglomerular EGFP+ cells was found to co-express TH, a marker specific for dopaminergic neurons (Figure 5).",1
1,26,"On the other side, VGLUT2, a commonly used marker for glutamatergic terminations, could be detected in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus and surrounded EGFP+ cells at D29, revealing that EGFP-expressing cells received glutamatergic inputs (Figure 5). In addition, we scrutinized for the expression of the calcium-binding proteins calbindin-D28K, calretinin and parvalbumin in the EGFP-labeled granule neurons at this time point. The calbindin-D28K, which is expressed in mature granule neurons, could be detected in most EGFP+ cells of the dentate gyrus (Figure 5). In contrast, no parvalbumin and only weak expression of calretinin could be detected in EGFP+ cells of the dentate gyrus at this time point, although cells expressing high levels of parvalbumin or calretinin, the latter been specifically found in newly generated granule cells, could be detected in the vicinity (see for example arrow in Figure 5e).",1
1,27,"DCX expression takes place in a relatively heterogeneous population of neuronal precursors and young neurons of various maturation stages and proliferative statuses. Administration of BrdU to label proliferative cells was performed at various time points following recombination. At the earliest time point investigated, D2, approximately 51.1% of EGFP+ cells in the SVZ, but only 7.7% of EGFP+ cells in the SGZ incorporated BrdU respectively, confirming that a fraction of the cells was still proliferating (Figure 6). The higher proportion of mitotically active cells in the SVZ might be explained by the emigration of post-mitotic young neurons out of the SVZ towards the OB, leaving the most immature cells behind. Furthermore, no more BrdU incorporation in EGFP+ cells was observed in SGZ at D15 (Figure 6), underscoring the temporally limited proliferative capacity of DCX+ cells. In contrast, although no more BrdU incorporation in EGFP+ cells was observed in SGZ at D15, a few BrdU+/EGFP+ co-labeling cells could be found in RMS (data not shown), suggesting that some EGFP+ cells in SVZ/RMS/OB axis could keep proliferative capacity until at least D15.",1
1,28,"Following administration of TAM to adult DCXCreERT2:CAG-CAT-EGFP mice, EGFP+ cells could be detected outside of the described neurogenic regions. In this respect, scattered DCX-expressing cells have previously been reported in adult cerebral cortex of rodents, cats and primates [7,27]. To validate that EGFP expression in cells located outside of the neurogenic regions ensued from concomitant expression of DCX, we scrutinized by immunohistochemistry DCX expression pattern in the whole adult brain in respect to the activation of the EGFP expression.",1
1,29,"Low to moderate levels of DCX expression could be detected in cells dispersed throughout the cerebral cortex (Figure 7). Some weak DCX expression could also be perceived in corpus callosum, as well as around the 3rd ventricle and hypothalamus, the molecular cell layer (MCL) and the granular cell layer (GCL) of cerebellum (data not show). Four weeks after TAM injection, EGFP+ cells also appeared in these regions (Figure 7). The reporter expression levels however were significantly higher than the endogenous DCX expression levels, since upon recombination, expression of the reporter gene was under the control of a strong promoter. Importantly, EGFP+ cells located outside of the neurogenic regions were not proliferative, as demonstrated by the absence of BrdU incorporation. Therefore, the nature and fate of these immature neurons remains to be deciphered.",1
1,30,"In this report, we demonstrated that CreERT2-mediated recombination can be efficiently and specifically targeted in vivo in DCX-expressing cells, i.e. in the neuronal precursors and young neurons, using a DCX promoter-driven CreERT2. In contrast to DCX promoter-driven reporter lines previously generated [10,11], the DCXCreERT2 construct described here additionally encodes the 3’UTR region of the DCX mRNA. The large DCX 3’UTR is known to contain post-transcriptional regulation elements of gene expression [28]. However, under experimental conditions used in this study, no overt differences in the expression pattern of the CreERT2 transgene could be documented in comparison to former lines devoid of DCX 3’UTR sequences. Nevertheless, the presence of DCX 3’UTR could lead to a more faithful CreERT2 expression pattern within the DCX-expressing cell population and more investigation will be required to understand its function.",1
1,31,"One day after TAM administration, the CreERT2 protein was translocated to the nuclear compartment of DCX-expressing cells where it could proceed to recombination. The latter resulted in a rapid activation of reporter expression; b-gal or EGFP could be readily detected in the embryonic, as well as in the adult CNS, one day after tamoxifen injection (Figure 2). Following five daily tamoxifen administrations, 94% DCX+ cells in SVZ and 77% DCX+ cells in the dentate gyrus induced expression of EGFP, demonstrating a high efficiency of recombination using our experimental paradigms. On the other side, about 96% of EGFP+ cells in SVZ and 90% of EGFP+ cells in SGZ were co-expressing DCX, confirming that the recombination activity was induced with high specificity. (Figure 3). As the fate of EGFP+ cells was observed to be solely neuronal, we conclude that the absence of DCX expression in a small fraction of the EGFP+ resulted from the maturation-associated downregulation of DCX+ over the 5 days of TAM injection.",1
1,32,"Although the nuclear translocation of the CreERT2 was transient, expression of the reporter got permanently induced following recombination, which allows for the long-term analysis of cell types arising from DCX+ cells. Hence, one month after recombination in the DCX-CreERT2, the vast majority of the EGFP+ cells in the neurogenic target regions expressed NeuN, a marker found in mature neurons. In addition, a few EGFP+ cells along the neuroblasts’ migratory route or localized outside neurogenic regions were found to express low levels of DCX. Importantly, one month after the last TAM injection, no co-localization between the EGFP signal and the expression of GFAP (astrocyte marker), CNPase (oligodendrocyte marker) or Iba I (microglia marker) was detected (data not shown). This substantiates evidences that DCX-expressing cells are determined to become neurons under physiological conditions. This contrast with the use of the nestin promoter to drive the expression of the CreERT, which resulted in the labeling of the neural stem cell population generating thereafter a continuous flow of new neurons and glia [17].",1
1,33,"Calbindin-D28K, calretinin and parvalbumin belong to the superfamily of low molecular weight calcium-binding proteins and are characteristic of different subpopulations of neurons [29]. Hence, in the dentate gyrus, Calbindin-D28K is as marker of mature granule cells while calretinin is transiently expressed in postmitotic newly generated neurons [30,31]. In agreement with the latter, we observed that EGFP+ granular cells in the dentate gyrus were expressing Calbindin-D28K, a few of them expressed low levels of calretinin, and none of them expressed parvalbumin four weeks after recombination (Figure 5). The absence of co-localization between EGFP and parvalbumin reinforced evidence that this GABAergic subpopulation is not replenished by a constant addition of new neurons in adult dentate gyrus, although this matter is still under debate [32-34].",1
1,34,"Following recombination in DCX-CreERT mice, EGFP+ cells were also found within non-neurogenic brain areas. In mammals, DCX+ cells have been reported outside neurogenic regions, including temporal and prefrontal cortex layer II, piriform cortex layer III/endopiriform nucleus, corpus callosum, nucleus accumbens, ventromedial striatum, ventrolateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, molecular cell layer, granular cell layer and white matter of cerebellum. The distribution and frequency of these DCX+ cells appear to increase in superior species of the phylogeny, although it remains to be elucidated to which extent this is due to an increase of DCX expression levels and thereby a better immunohistochemical detectability [7,8,35-37].",1
1,35,"Intriguingly, the numbers of EGFP+ cells around the 3 rd ventricle and hypothalamus appeared markedly higher than the numbers of DCX+ cells detected in these regions. The reason of this discrepancy may be related to a very low expression level of DCX in these cells, which would be hardly detectable using current antibodies. In contrast, once DCX-associated recombination occurred, the expression of reporter genes is controlled by a strong constitutive promoter allowing for an easy detection of targeted cells.",1
1,36,"The origin and function of DCX-expressing cells outside of the neurogenic regions remain to be elucidated. For instance, it was reported that the neural stem cells can be isolated from virtually every region of the adult CNS [38]. In addition, upon specific treatment, neurogenic events have been induced within the adult cortex, striatum, CA1 region of the hippocampus, and even within the white matter [39-42]. It is tempting to conclude that some of the DCX-expressing cells detected in these regions were generated by a very low rate continuous neurogenesis. However, the absence of BrdU labeling obtained in these cells under physiological conditions suggests that such a mechanism of DCX+ cells generation would be marginal in the best case.",1
1,37,"On the other side, there exists good evidence that the extra-neurogenic DCX-expressing cells might have been generated during developmental neurogenesis, but never fully completed their maturation process [43]. These cells would remain in the parenchyma as “quiescent” local neuronal precursors. The existence of such quiescent precursors has also been suggested following grafting experiments in which neural stem cells were injected into the ventricles during cortical development [44]. Detection of these cells at a later time point revealed that stem cells were integrated as neurons into various brain regions, but at the same time, a certain amount of cells remained as immature neurons in the parenchyma, potentially as a reservoir of precursor cells available for plasticity or local repair.",1
1,38,"Recently, another mouse model expressing the DCXCreERT has been reported [34]. In contrast to our model based on the human DCX promoter, Cheng and colleagues used a BAC construct encoding the murine DCX promoter. The latter, together with a possible positional effect of the transgene may explain the differences observed between the two models. For instance, in contrast to our mouse model, the model from Cheng et al. is exclusively active in DCX-expressing cells within the hippocampus [34]. Also, the authors claim that recombination in their DCX-CreERT mice takes only place in post-mitotic neuronal precursors. Given the fact that a significant fraction of all DCX-expressing cells are still in a proliferative state (see Figure 6 and [10]), this suggests that the induction of the DCXCreERT transgene expression reported by Cheng is delayed in respect to the endogenous DCX. Thus, the DCX-CreERT mouse model presented by Cheng and colleagues appears to be well-suited for the study addressing the maturation and fate of newly generated granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Still, there is a lack of model(s) addressing the fate of DCX-expressing cells located outside of the dentate gyrus - such as in the subventricular zone (SVZ) - which is now possible by the model presented in this manuscript.",1
1,39,"We report here a transgenic mouse model based on an inducible Cre recombinase driven by the DCX promoter (DCX-CreERT2). Taken the high specificity and efficiency of recombination in neuroblasts and young neurons, this transgenic mouse model constitutes a powerful tool for tracing neurogenesis and fate-analysis of newly generated neurons. It is moreover a valuable model for studying molecular mechanisms of neural plasticity and neurogenesis through induction or silencing of specific genes in neuroblasts and young neurons. Finally, the possibility to analyze the long-term fate of newly generated neurons will be an asset in the development of innovative therapies against neurologic diseases.",1
2,1,"Despite considerable worldwide efforts made in recent years to control malaria [1], the disease is still a major public health problem with nearly 250 million cases and about one million deaths each year. Eighty five percent of deaths occur among children under five [2] from which nearly all are in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2007, malaria was declared to be the most important disease in this age group, in Benin, leading to 43% of all medical consultations and 29% of hospital admissions [3]. The National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) has implemented WHO/GMP’s (World Health Organization/Global Malaria Programme) recommended preventive and curative strategies [4]. These include i) Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) which is dispensed at health centers and has recently been made available to communities for children under five years old; ii) Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) during pregnancy; iii) Long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets (LLINs) which have continued to be distributed following the nation-wide deployment among high-risk populations (i.e. children of under five and pregnant women) and iv) Indoor residual spraying (IRS) using carbamate insecticide applied in specific districts through the President’s Malaria Initiative [5].",1
2,2,"Many studies have demonstrated that the use of insecticide treated nets reduced uncomplicated malaria episodes by at least 50% [6]. Unfortunately, insecticide resistance in malaria vectors has dramatically increased in Africa [7], especially in Benin [8-10] and may seriously compromise the success of vector control management. Two studies conducted in experimental huts in South Benin, where Anopheles gambiae was resistant to pyrethroids, have reported that significant reduction in the efficacy of pyrethroids was applied either in treated nets or IRS [11,12]. In order to manage insecticide resistance, the Centre de Recherche Entomologique de Cotonou (CREC) in collaboration with the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD) and the NMCP has evaluated successfully (WHOPES phases I and II) a new insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategy combining in the same household a LLIN and a carbamate treated plastic sheeting [13,14]. In the context of a future community-based evaluation of this promising IRM strategy (phase III trial), the malaria burden was evaluated in a health district of southern Benin where a nation-wide distribution of LLINs to children <5 had been implemented in 2007.",1
2,3,"This epidemiological study was carried out in the Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito health district in southern Benin (Figure 1), from December 2007 to November 2008. The population size in the study area was 178,314 inhabitants according to the results of the 3rd General Census of the Population and the Environment (RGPH3) of February 2002. The population is rural and lives on agriculture with scattered settlement. The main ethnic group is Aïzo. The climate is essentially subequatorial, with two dry seasons (a long dry season from December to March and a short dry season in August and September), and two rainy seasons (a long rainy season from April to July and a short rainy season from October to November). The average annual rainfall is around 1,200 mm, of which 700-800 mm and 400-500 mm rain down respectively in the first and in the second rainy season. The hottest months (31°C) are February to April and the coldest months (27°C) are July to September. Less than 30% of children are present at the health centre when sick. They are mostly treated by traditional medication [15]. A recent survey in Benin indicated that less than half of febrile children <5 were received anti-malarial drugs of which only 7% of cases were given ACT [16,17].",1
2,4,"Twenty eight villages were chosen according to the following criteria: having between 250-500 inhabitants, distance between any villages greater than two kilometers and the absence of a local health centre. From these, seven villages were randomly selected. Geographical, demographical and environmental characteristics are described in Table 1. After census, about 60 children aged 0-71 months were randomly selected in each village. They were clinically monitored for a total of 48 days spread over one year. Children born during the study were not included. Ethical clearance was given for the study by the National Ethical Committee in Benin (Comité National Provisoire d’Ethique pour la Recherche en Santé, Reference number IRB00006860) and IRD ethical committee. Mosquito collectors gave their written informed consent and were treated free of charge for malaria presumed illness. They were also vaccinated against yellow fever. Each head of family or the guardian of the selected child gave their written informed consent. During the monitoring periods, all children of villages, whom participating in the study or not to, were treated free of charge by the medical staff.",1
2,5,"Active case detection (ACD) for malaria episodes was carried out during eight periods of six consecutive days at six weeks intervals throughout the year. Each day a nurse assisted by a local village helper trained for the study, visited the households in the sample. A physician supervised the field work. The presence or absence and state of health of each child were recorded daily on a specially prepared form (one form per household). The nurse examined and recorded data on every case of sickness detected at home. A thick blood film was taken from every sick child. Children were treated according to the clinical diagnosis made by the nurse. When malaria was suspected, the patient was treated with artemether-lumefantrine for three days according to the recommendations of WHO and NMCP [19,20]. Crosssectional surveys (CSS) were carried out at each monitoring clinical period (n = 8) on every asymptomatic child (confirmed by axillary temperature < 37.5°C). A thick film sample was taken on the fourth day to be sure that asymptomatic children were free of illness in preceding days. Cross-check quality controls were conducted every six weeks during the collection of field data.",1
2,6,"Data were collected two weeks before each clinical monitoring. Adult mosquitoes were caught using Human Landing Catches (HLC) technique [21]. In the study area, 896 human-nights of capture of human landing mosquitoes were organized every six weeks over a year period (128 nights per village; eight places per village and per night, half indoor and half outdoor). Treated nets were present in the mosquito collection sites. The mosquito species were identified using morphological characteristics according to the identification keys of Gillies & De Meillon [22] and Gillies & Coetzee [23]. All mosquitoes of An. gambiae complex and Anopheles funestus group were stored in individual tubes with silicagel and preserved at -20°C for P. falciparum circumsporozoite index estimation and molecular identification.",1
2,7,"The ownership, the use and the correct use of LLINs (Permanet® 2.0) which were distributed in October 2007 were checked over weekly-survey. The visits of the nurse were unannounced and took place in the late evening around 9.00 PM when children were expected to be asleep [24]. The unannounced visits determined the ownership (whether the LLINs were seen during the control), the use (whether children were sleeping under it during the control) and the correct use (whether the LLINs were correctly hung and tucked and were not torn). The rates of LLINs ownership, use and correct use were calculated relative to the total number of observations.",1
2,8,"Laboratory processing was done at the CREC, Cotonou. Parasitological infection was detected on Giemsa-stained thick smears. Asexual stages of each Plasmodium species were counted in the blood volume occupied by 200 leucocytes and parasite density was calculated by assuming 8,000 leucocytes/μL of blood. Thick smears from each village were read by the same experienced technician, under the supervision of a parasitologist. The readings of the two technicians were also compared on the same set of blood samples. Their estimations of parasite detection and parasite density did not differ significantly. Cross-check quality control was regularly done on a randomly selected sample representing 10% of all thick smears.",1
2,9,"After scoring field-collected Anopheles mosquitoes and identifying the species of each specimen by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) [25], the presence and relative frequency of the molecular M and S forms of An. gambiae sensu stricto (s.s) were determined according to the method of Favia [26]. Infection of mosquitoes was determined on the head and thorax of individual vector specimens by ELISA using monoclonal antibodies against P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) [27]. The method of Martinez-Torrez was used for the molecular detection of the L1014F kdr allele [28].",1
2,10,"Demographic, parasitological, clinical and entomological data were double entered independently in the Access 2003 database. Parasitological and clinical data were analyzed using the svy command (STATA 11.0). For each person only one blood sample per monitoring period was considered for analysis. When a pathological condition was detected, the blood sample taken during the clinical episode was retained for analysis. Parasitological data were analyzed separately in terms of prevalence of P. falciparum asexual blood forms, density of P. falciparum asexual blood forms in parasite positive blood thick films and prevalence of P. falciparum gametocytes. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach, which can be used with normal distributions and discrete data was used for statistical analysis of repeated measures. To take into account the interdependence of observations made on the same person, an exchangeable correlation structure was used in which the correlation between these observations made on one person at different times was assumed to be the same. The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria infections was analyzed as a binomial response by using a logistic regression model.",1
2,11,"The association between the parasite density and the occurrence of clinical episodes was tested using a Poisson regression model, taking clinical status (pathological episode versus asymptomatic state) as the dependent variable, and parasite density as the independent variable. In this type of model, a random intercept variable is allowed to vary with subjects, and this random subject-specific intercept allows the interdependence of the observations made on the same person to be taken into account. For each pathological period, the probability that it was caused by malaria was estimated by the Attributable Fraction (AF) calculated from the odds ratios associated with the estimated parasite density in the logistic model [29,30]. The pathological episodes were clinically defined by a high axillary temperature (≥37.5°C), sweats, shivers, headaches, nausea or vomiting [31] or by a history of fever during the 48 hours proceeding the first day of ACD or, for infants under one year of age, anorexia or any pathological condition described by the mother [32,33]. For individuals, the number of malaria attacks over a given periods was estimated by the sum of probabilities that pathological episodes were due to malaria, depending on the parasite density.",1
2,12,"The three dependent variables (i.e. prevalence rate of P. falciparum infection, mean parasite density in positive children and clinical incidence rate) were analyzed according to demographic (age groups 0-23, 24-59, 6071 months and sex), environmental (season and villages) and sanitary (LLIN’s ownership, use and good use) variables. The Chi 2 test was used to compare the rate of ownership, use and correct use of LLINs. An optimum pyrogenic parasite density cut-off was calculated using the estimated AFs with a logistic model. The sensitivity and the specificity were similarly determined [34]. The sensitivity was estimated by the ratio of malaria episodes with positive cut-off to a total of malaria episodes. The specificity was estimated by the ratio of no malaria febrile episodes with parasite density below the cut-off to the total of no malaria febrile episodes. The suitable positive Likelihood-ratio (>10), negative Likelihood-ratio (<0.1) results and Youden’s J index were also determined from the model.",1
2,13,The human biting rate (HBR) was expressed as the number of anopheles bites per human per night. The sporozoite index was calculated as the proportion of mosquitoes found to be positive for CSP. The entomological inoculation rate (EIR) was calculated as the product of the HBR and the sporozoite index and expressed as the number of infected bites per human per year.,1
2,14,"A total of 440 children in seven villages were parasitologically and clinically monitored during 18,262 persondays from which 402 (2.2%) were missing for the following reasons: 366 not found and 36 refusals. Ten children died during the study. The mean age of the children at inclusion was 2.1 years. The female/male ratio was 1:1. Each child in the survey was visited on an average of 42 days out of the 48. A total of 3,074 thick blood films were taken, comprising 2,838 in asymptomatic children and 236 in sick children, with an average of seven per child",1
2,15,"Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale were present alone or mixed (Table 2). The annual prevalence rate of P. falciparum infection was 21.8% (95%CI 19.1-24.4). In the multivariate random-effects logistic regression model, age of children, season, village and correct use of LLINs, but not the ownership and the use of LLINs were significantly associated with the prevalence of infection (Table 3). The correct use of LLINs conferred a 26% individual protective effect against infection prevalence (OR = 0.74 (95% CI 0.62-0.87), p = 0.005). The prevalence of infection increased with age. Children aged 1 to 2 years and 3 to 5 years were three to five times more frequently infected than children aged less than one year (22.0% (CI95% 17.0-27.0) and 33.0% (CI95% 28.4-37.6) versus 7.8% (CI95% 5.2-10.5)). The prevalence of infection was higher during the dry season (24.7% (CI95% 21.6-27.8) than during the rainy season (18.6% (CI95% 15.7-21.5)). The prevalence of infection was higher in Satré, Wanho, Kindjitopka and Hèkandji than in Dokanmè, Aidjèdo and Guézohoué.",1
2,16,"The mean parasite density in positive asymptomatic children was 586 P. falciparum asexual forms per μL of blood (95%CI 504-680). According to multivariate random-effects linear regression model, increased parasite density was associated with some villages (Dokanmè and Satré) but not with age of children, season, ownership and use of LLINs (Table 4). Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte annual prevalence rate was 3.0% (95%CI 2.2-5.6) and differed significantly between the dry (3.8% (95% CI 2.9-4.8)) and the rainy season (2.2% (95%CI 1.4-3.0)), p = 0.008.",1
2,17,"During the study 236 pathological episodes were detected. A total of 110 pathological episodes were parasite positive: 102 children with P. falciparum alone, three individuals with P. malariae alone, two individuals with P. ovale alone and three individuals with mixed infection. The P. malariae single infections showed densities of 480, 2,360 and 200 parasites/μL and P. ovale single infections showed densities of 4,800 and 9,800 parasites/μL. Three mixed infections with P. falciparum and P. ovale showed combined densities of 3,760 Pf + 720 Po, 960 Pf + 400 Po and 280 Pf + 120 Po (Table 2). In all age groups, the mean parasite density was lower in healthy children than sick children (Figure 2). Four parasite positive cases with P. falciparum referred to the health centre were diagnosed as severe malaria with anaemia. Among the 236 pathological episodes, there were 74 episodes attributable to P. falciparum malaria (Table 5). The optimal pyrogenic parasite cut-off of 2,000 P. falciparum asexual blood forms per μL was determined as corresponding to levels of sensitivity and specificity of 94.0% and 94.5% respectively (Table 6). The mean annual clinical incidence rate was 1.5 per child per year (95%CI 1.2-1.9).",1
2,18,"Overall 13,602 mosquitoes including 115 An. Gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) (65 and 50 indoor and outdoor, respectively) and 67 An. funestus (40 and 27 indoor and outdoor, respectively) were caught in the seven villages. The number of CSP positive An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus were nine and four respectively. The aggressiveness of culicidae and malaria vectors (An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus) were 5,541 (95%CI 2,008-15,288) and 74 (95%CI 17-318) bites per human per year. The annual EIR was 5.3 (95%CI 1.1-25.9) infected bites per human per year. The 1014F kdr allele was present in both molecular M and S forms. The frequency of this mutation was respectively 0.47 (95%CI 0.37-0.57) and 0.61 (95%CI 0.43-0.80) in the M and S forms.",1
2,19,"The LLINs ownership rate reached 91.8% (2,769/3017; 95%IC 90.8-92.8) and remained high through the year. Use was significantly higher during the rainy season than the dry season 73% (1,062/1,451; 95%CI 70-75) and 67% (1,047/1,566; 95%CI 64-69) respectively, p = 0.0001. It significantly decreased to 31% (118/385; 95%CI 26-31) in the middle of dry season. Correct use was also the highest during the rainy season (68% (990/1,566; 95%CI 65-70)) compared to the dry season (42% (665/1,171; 95%CI 40-45)), p < 0.0001, (Figure 3C).",1
2,20,"This prospective longitudinal study allowed the epidemiology of malaria in the health district of Ouidah-KpomassèTori Bossito after the nation-wide distribution of LLINs to children in October 2007 to be characterized. Previous studies have described the epidemiology of malaria in Benin, by focusing mainly on malaria transmission [35] and on clinical and parasitological aspects as well in rural areas [36-38] as in the city of Cotonou [39]. Other authors [40] described the process indicators, results and impact of malaria control which were useful for the implementation of the monitoring and assessment system of ‘’Roll Back Malaria’’ in Benin. The large scale and selective distribution of LLINs in Africa in the last decade were also the subject of several studies which concerned mainly the acceptability and/or the population perception without investigating their parasitological and clinical effects [41-47]. Pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors has been observed in many African countries [7]. Nevertheless, no loss of effectiveness of LLINs has been reported at an operational level [48].",1
2,21,"The entomological findings showed that the health district of Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito is a mesoendemic area with a mean annual EIR of 5.3 infected bites (95%CI 1.1-25.9). This EIR was found in conjunction with the annual prevalence rate of 21.8% (95%CI 19.1-24.4) observed in young asymptomatic children [29,49,50]. It confirms Velema’s parasitological observations in the same area twenty years ago [36]. As regards the resistance of An. gambiae to pyrethroids, the L1014F kdr allele reached 50%, in accordance with previous studies carried out in southern Benin [8,18]. The annual infection rate increased with age in accordance with what is usually observed in mesoendemic area [50]. The high infection rate in the dry season could be influenced by the peak observed at the end of the rainy season (33%) just one month after the national distribution of LLINs (Figure 3A, Table 3). The parasite density of positive children did not vary with age group or season (Figure 2). These results may be attributed to the protection conferred by LLINs. In mesoendemic areas, the acquisition of immunity against malaria would develop gradually and bring about a decrease in parasitaemia with increasing age [51].",1
2,22,"The calculated AF of pathological episodes to malaria helped to determine the optimum parasite pyrogenic cutoff at 2,000 P. falciparum asexual blood forms per μL. The use of AF to define the pyrogenic parasite cut-off allows the best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity level [54]. In stable malaria areas, P. falciparum parasitaemia is dependent on the season and age, which affects the malaria-AF of pathological episodes and thus the malaria case definition according to pyrogenic parasite density cutoff [33,55]. In the present study, the parasite density did not vary with season or age. Therefore, the AF could be considered the same whatever the season and the age group. The cut-off of 2,000 falciparum asexual blood forms per μL was close to the value of 1,000 found in mesoendemic area on children under 3 years [36] and to the 3,000 to 6,000 found in hyperendemic area among children aged 0 to 12 years in south of Benin respectively [37].",1
2,23,"In the health district of Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito, one pathological episode out of three was attributed to malaria. To avoid a maximum of missed cases the malaria case definition took into account signs evoking malaria or history of fever during the 48 hours preceding the first day of ACD as advised Mcguinness [33]. Mean annual incidence rate of falciparum clinical malaria was 1.5 per child per year. In P. falciparum high-endemic area, the pyrogenic cut-off of parasitaemia in persons of a given age is similar for all Plasmodium species [56]. Given the high parasite density, P. malariae could have been responsible for one malaria clinical case with 2,360 parasites/μL and P. ovale for two cases with a parasitaemia of (4,800 and 9,800 parasites/μL) respectively.",1
2,24,"In 2001 before the national distribution of LLINs, in south of Benin, 4.3% of household owned a treated net (ITN) and 2.4% of children under five years old slept under ITNs [40]. In 2006, ITNs possession was estimated to 25.6% and its utilization by the children less than 5 years was 21% in Ouidah [15]. After the national distribution of LLINs, ownership rose to over of 90% and was continuous over of the year (Figure 3C). Throughout the 12 months of the study, two children out of three were found sleeping under LLINs during unannounced and nocturnal inspections. Some studies have already concluded that free distribution of nets via a national campaign is effective in rapidly increasing their possession and use [42,57,58]. This high percentage of use may have been the result of adapted sensitization to the beliefs and behaviours of the communities and to the presence of medical staff assisted by a local village helper. Indeed, the success of sensitization depended strongly on the partnership between the study team and the local leaders as described by Paré Toé [47]. The 31% reduction of LLINs use during the dry season in Benin is comparable to that observed in most of the West African countries (Figure 3C) [24,41,43].",1
2,25,"In conclusion, the health district of Ouidah-KpomassèTori Bossito is a mesoendemic area characterized by a moderate level of pyrethroid resistance of vectors and a high heterogeneity of malaria infection between villages. Malaria infection and disease did not vary through the year. The used LLINs rate was high and only the correct use of LLINs was found to reduce malaria infection without influencing malaria morbidity.",1
3,1,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and the associated disease postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) have caused heavy losses in global agriculture in recent decades. Rapid detection of PCV2 is very important for the effective prophylaxis and treatment of PMWS. To establish a sensitive, specific assay for the detection and quantitation of PCV2, we designed and synthesized specific primers and a probe in the open reading frame 2. The assay had a wide dynamic range with excellent linearity and reliable reproducibility, and detected between 102 and 1010 copies of the genomic DNA per reaction. The coefficient of variation for Ct values varied from 0.59% to 1.05% in the same assay and from 1.9% to 4.2% in 10 different assays. The assay did not cross-react with porcine circovirus type 1, porcine reproductive and respiratory, porcine epidemic diarrhea, transmissible gastroenteritis of pigs and rotavirus. The limits of detection and quantitation were 10 and 100 copies, respectively. Using the established real-time PCR system, 39 of the 40 samples we tested were detected as positive.",1
3,2,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is widespread in the commercial swine population [1-5], and is accepted as the causative agent of a number of diseases in these animals, particularly postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) [6].

There is therefore an urgent need for specific and effective methods to detect the virus.",1
3,3,"By comparison with conventional PCR and ELISA, real-time PCR offers an effective way to detect target fragments specifically, rapidly and quantitatively. Falsepositive results and pollution can be prevented effectively at the same time. Therefore, real-time PCR has been developed quickly and has become the main method for pathogen detection [8].",1

Therefore, rapid and sensitive detection and quantitation assays for PCV2 are urgently needed both by the pig industry and research community. In comparison with conventional PCR, TaqMan real-time PCR is more sensitive and less easily contaminated. The main difficulty of using conventional PCR is that contamination occurs when products are examined in gels, which leads to false-positive results in later experiments. For this reason, real-time PCR is widely used, and in addition, it has heightened sensitivity and requires less time than conventional PCR.",1
3,19,"The major conserved region for PCV2 located in ORF2 is likely to be the ideal reference fragment to detect PCV2, because this region displays the highest diversity between PCV1 and PCV2 and there are more sequenced isolates available from PCV2 than there are from PCV1 [14]. Hybridization probes that combine only with the target products have primarily been used in previous studies to detect PCV2, and the results of these studies have shown high sensitivity and specificity. Several other methods are available to detect and quantify PCV2. Brunborg et al. [14] have used a TaqMan probe to detect an 84-bp fragment in ORF2 and to quantify the viral load in different tissues and serum samples. In a report by Chung et al. [15], PCV2 was quantified in naturally infected and challenged pigs using a TaqMan real-time PCR that detected a fragment of 269 bp. Yang et al. [16] have used SYBR Green I based on nucleotide sequences of ORF2 for the detection of PCV2.",1
3,20,"In this study we designed different primers, a different probe and a different real-time PCR system, which amplified a 149-bp fragment to detect PCV2. The realtime PCR approach increased the detection of PCV2 samples by 18% over that achieved by conventional PCR. Tests on the reproducibility of the method suggest that the established real-time PCR system appears to be reliable and stable. A series of experiments were carried out to assess the reproducibility, sensitivity, and specificity of the assay. Using several other swine viruses as template, no cross-reaction signals were detected, which demonstrated the specificity of the assay. The established real-time PCR system that we developed might not only provide an effective way to detect PCV2 rapidly and sensitively, but might also be applied to assess the effectiveness of vaccines developed to combat PCV2. The real-time PCR detection system complements and extends previous methods for detection and quantitation of PCV2. The specific detection method can also provide an alternative approach for detection of PCV2.",1
4,1,"In Nigeria, nearly 110 million of clinical cases of malaria are diagnosed per year, translating into about 50% of the adult population experiencing at least one malaria episode per year, while young children can have up to two to four attacks of malaria annually [1]. In addition to the direct health impact of malaria on the Nigerian population, the economic loss linked to malaria in this country is estimated to ~132 billion Naira (±878 million USD) per year. In order to combat this devastating situation, the Nigerian authorities developed in 1996 a first National Malaria Control Policy, and in 1999 the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) programme was initiated.",1
4,2,"National drug efficacy trials conducted in 2002 in Nigeria demonstrated that the first line treatments then employed, chloroquine and sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) were no longer adequate and in 2005, the highly efficacious artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) was introduced in the country [1]. Artemetherlumefantrine was elected first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria with artesunate-amodiaquine (AS + AQ) recommended as an alternative [2]. Nowadays, SP is not recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to its high resistance which can be as high as 35% but it is still in use for intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) in pregnant women. Similarity in the structure of SP and SMP denotes a potential for cross resistance [1,2].",1
4,3,"Although the use of ACT for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria has been introduced several years ago, its utilization in the field is still below expected levels. The reasons explaining this situation include the poor availability and/or relatively high cost of ACT on the African market. One of the key elements of the RBM strategy is that malaria patients should have access to appropriate and adequate treatment within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms [1,2]. An anti-malarial drug to be used at home must, therefore, be safe, effective, affordable, easy to administer and preferably available in a single dose package. Following these lines, fixed-dose combinations (FDC) are preferred to co-blistered drugs as they prevent inadequate dosing (preventing drug resistance) and contribute to increase treatment compliance.",1
4,4,"In view of the ideal profile to be found in an antimalarial drug, the combination of artesunate and sulphamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine (AS + SMP) represents an interesting treatment option in case first-line drugs are not readily available. In fact, this product is easy to use, safe, and has previously demonstrated high efficacy in several endemic areas whether it is taken under a 24- or 48- hour regimen [3-5]. Previously offered as a co-blistered drug [6,7], the AS + SMP combination is now available as a FDC, which can easily be taken by malaria patients (three tablets only). In addition, since the SMP component has broad-spectrum anti-microbial activity, it also presents the interesting advantage of offering ancillary benefits against infections that may have been wrongly diagnosed as malaria [8,9].",1
4,5,"In order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the 24hour therapy of AS + SMP FDC in south-west Nigeria, a cohort of children suffering from uncomplicated malaria were treated either with this ACT, or with a 48hour therapy of AS + AQ FDC.",1
4,6,"This study was conducted at the University College Hospital and at the Oni Memorial Children’s Hospital both located in the urban areas of Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. The intensity of malaria transmission varies considerably throughout Nigeria. Ibadan is located in the forest savannah woodland zone with average rainfall of 975 - 1474 mm/year [10]. Malaria, mainly caused by Plasmodium falciparum, is endemic in the region with a six-month transmission season (May-October) reaching its peak in August [11]. The overall entomological inoculation rates for Anopheles gambiae s.l. range from 18 to 145 infective bites per person per year [2]. Specifically in south-west Nigeria, the reported seasonal (sixmonth) entomological inoculation rates were 128.7 in 2001 and 131.3 in 2002 [11].",1
4,7,"This study was approved by the Joint Ethics Committee of University of Ibadan and University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. The study was conducted in accordance with all requirements of the ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice as well as the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki. Clinical trial approval was obtained from the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control in Nigeria (NAFDAC). Written informed consent was obtained from all parents or guardians of eligible children prior to enrolment.",1
4,8,"Children presenting to each of the two study sites were screened for eligibility and invited to participate in the study if they met the following inclusion criteria: aged between 1 and 13 years; body weight between 6 and 40 kg; history of fever in the previous 24 hours or measured fever (axillary temperature >37.5°C); mono-infection with P. falciparum, with parasitaemia in the range of 2,000-200,000 asexual parasites per microlitre of blood; and no general danger signs or signs of severe and complicated falciparum malaria as per WHO guidelines [12].",1
4,9,"A randomized, controlled, open-label trial design was used. Assuming a proportion of 94% patients cured (with PCR-corrected cure rate at day 28 as primary endpoint) with AS + SMP, an equal proportion of patients cured with AS + AQ, a sample of 250 patients (taking into account 10-15% loss to follow-up) was required in each treatment arm to detect the 6% difference in parasitological cure rates with a power of 80% (a = 0.025 one-sided). Sample size calculations were done using nQuery Advisor 5.0. The randomization code was computer-generated with stratification per treatment centre, from which treatment groups were assigned.",1
4,10,"At enrolment, a physical examination was performed, weight and axillary temperatures recorded and a medical history was obtained from parents/guardians including presenting symptoms and current medication. A finger prick blood sample was obtained for thin and thick blood smears and blotted on filter paper for parasite genotyping. A blood sample was also obtained for assessment of haematological and biochemical parameters.",1
4,11,"Eligible children were then assigned into one of the two treatment groups according to the randomization code. The treatments were given in the clinic by the recruiting physician. One group received three doses of artesunate/amodiaquine 100/206.2 mg tablets (Amonate®, Dafra Pharma ltd., Kenya), crushed mixed with clean water and administered at 0, 24 and 48 hours. The second group received artesunate/sulphamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine 100/250/12.5 mg tablets (CoArinate FDC ® Junior, Dafra Pharma Ltd., Kenya), crushed, mixed with water and administered at 0, 12 and 24 hours. Treatment doses were given based on the age of the patient: children under 7 years received 1/2 tablet per dose (50/153.1 mg As/AQ and 50/125/6.25 mg As/SM/P) while children aged 7 years and older received a full tablet per dose. They were then observed for 1 hour after drug administration for vomiting. If vomiting occurred within 30 min after administration, the full treatment dose was re-administered. If vomiting occurred between 30-60 min after administration, half the treatment dose was re-administered.",1
4,12,No prior therapy was given and the only concomitant therapy administered were antipyretic drugs in patients with temperatures ≥38.5°C.,1
4,13,"The children on 12 hourly regimen whose second dose fell at night were admitted for the treatment to be given by the nurses on duty to ensure treatment compliance. Clinical and parasitological evaluation (thin and thick smears) was done on each day of follow-up (days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28), or on any other day if the child was feeling sick. Patients were called back on these days or visited at home. During each visit, a brief clinical history was obtained to assess new complaints and possible side effects and a physical examination was performed. The haemogram and biochemical analysis (bilirubin, creatinine and liver enzymes AST, ALT) were done on days 0, 7 and 14 to detect possible significant abnormalities. Filter paper blood samples for parasite genotyping were obtained on day 28 or earlier if presented with repeat of the symptoms. Patients were excluded from the study if they withdrew consent, left the study area or reported taking anti-malarial medication during the follow-up period.",1
4,14,"Response to drug treatment was assessed using modified WHO clinical classification system: all patients were not febrile at presentation, hence a temperature < 37.5° C was not an exclusion criterion and patients were followed up for 28 days in this area of intense transmission. The clinical classification system consisted of adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR), late parasitological failure (LPF), late clinical failure (LCF) and early treatment failure (ETF). The cure rates on day 28 were adjusted on the basis of the PCR genotyping results of paired samples for patients with recurrent parasitaemia after day 14 of starting treatment.",1
4,15,"A finger prick blood sample was taken to prepare thick and thin blood smears on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and on any other (unscheduled) visit. The slides were air dried, stained with 10% Giemsa for 20 min and read independently by two technicians. Parasite density (the number of parasites and gametocytes per μl) was calculated by counting parasites against 200 leukocytes and assuming a leukocyte count of 6,000/μl of blood. A slide was considered negative after reading at least 200 power fields. Thin blood smears were specifically used to identify Plasmodium parasite species. All qualitative discordant slides and slides with a parasite density difference ≥50% were read by a third microscopist. For quality control 10% of randomly selected slides were reread by an independent microscopist, not involved in the study.",1
4,16,"Filter paper blood spots were collected on days 0, 28 or any other day of recurrent parasitaemia. Genotypes of the parasite population in each sample collected from patients with microscopically confirmed P. falciparum infections at enrollment, and during follow-up if the patients were parasitaemic on or before D28 were determined using PCR techniques. Analysis of genetic polymorphisms was performed on paired primary and posttreatment parasites samples obtained from the two treatment groups. Paired primary and post-treatment parasites were analysed using parasite loci that exhibit repeated numbers of polymorphisms to distinguish true treatment failures from new infections. Briefly, block 2 of MSP-1 (merozoite surface proteins-1), and the Block 3 of MSP-2 (merozoite surface protein-2) and region II of GLURP were amplified by two rounds of PCR using primers and amplification conditions [12,13]. Ten microliters of the PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and sized against a 100-base pair molecular weight marker (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The banding pattern of the posttreatment parasites were compared with matched primary parasites.",1
4,17,"The case report forms were double checked to ensure complete and accurate data collection. Dual data entry was done by two clerks after which data was compared, corrected and validated by the data manager. Data analysis was done using Epi Info version 6 and SPSS version 11. The primary analysis was a non-inferiority analysis (with clinically relevant difference of 6% and one-sided significance level of a = 0.025) based on PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) on day 28 as primary efficacy endpoint [15]. Secondary endpoints included gametocyte carriage, fever and parasite clearance time and packed cell volume levels. Chisquare and Fisher exact or Yate’s correction tests were used to compare proportions between treatment groups. Normally distributed continuous variables were compared using Student’s t test between two independent groups while non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon rank-sum) were used to analyse skewed data. Kaplan Meier was used to analyse the significance between the rates of reinfection in the two treatment arms. Two tailed p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. The Intention-To-Treat (ITT) population including all patients who were randomized to either of the two treatment groups and received at least one dose of study medication was used for safety analysis.",1
4,18,"Out of 3,500 children screened for malaria, 500 were enrolled into the trial; 250 were assigned to the AS + AQ treatment arm and 250 to the AS + SMP arm (Figure 1). Thirty three children (6.6%) were lost to followup, of which 21 in the AS + SMP arm and 12 in the AS + AQ arm. Both treatment groups were comparable in terms of baseline demographic, clinical, parasitological and laboratory characteristics (Table 1).",1
4,19,"There were two early treatment failures, one in each treatment arm (0.4%). The PCR corrected cure rates for day 28 was 97.9% in the AS + AQ arm and 95.6% in the AS + SMP arm (p = 0.15). The re-infection rate was 1.7% in the AS + AQ arm and 5.7% in the AS + SMP arm (Table 2, 3 and Additional file 1) (p = 0.021).",1
4,20,"The median fever clearance time was similar in the two treatment groups: 1 day for both AS + SMP and AS + AQ (p = 0.271). The median parasite clearance time was also similar in the two treatment groups with a range of 1 - 7 days for AS + SMP and 1 - 3 days for AS + AQ (p = 0.941). The proportions of children with gametocytes over the follow-up period were similar in both treatment groups. Sixteen children in each treatment arm had gametocytes on day 0 (7.0% for AS + SMP and 6.7% for AS + AQ) (Table 2). On day 28, the proportion of children with gametocytes was reduced to 2.2% for AS + SMP and 3.4% for AS + AQ (p = 0.408) (Figure 2). On day 14, the proportion of children with anaemia was reduced to 1.3% both in AS + SMP and AS + AQ treatment group (Figure 3).",1
4,21,"Serious adverse events were not reported in any of the patients. There was no significant difference in the proportions of patients reporting adverse events in the two treatment groups. Five patients (2.2%) treated with AS + AQ reported one or more of the following adverse events: vomiting (n = 1), excessive sleepiness (n = 2), abdominal pain (n = 1), and weakness (n = 3). Three patients (1.3%) treated with AS + SMP reported vomiting, one of these patients also reported nausea as adverse event. None of these patients needed to be admitted as a result of these events. For all children, laboratory values (packed cell volume, liver enzymes, bilirubin) remained within normal levels during the follow-up period (Table 4).",1
4,22,This study is documenting the efficacy and tolerability of AS + SMP compared to the recommended artesunate-amodiaquine (AS + AQ) ACT for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in children in an endemic area of south-western Nigeria. The study was based on a 28-day follow-up period.,1
4,23,"Many African countries have adopted artemisinin based combination therapies (ACTs) as first-line therapy against uncomplicated malaria, particularly artemetherlumefantrine (AL) and AS + AQ. However based on field experience, there is a need to assess other forms of ACT in order to identify a suitable alternative to recommended treatments in case those are not readily available to the patients who urgently need to be treated. The 28-day cure rates observed in this study were 95.6% in the AS + SMP treatment arm compared to 97.9% in the AS + AQ treatment arm (p = 0.151) suggesting that the therapeutic efficacy of both drugs were similar.",1
4,24,"These findings are in agreement with previously reported studies on AS + SMP from other endemic and non-endemic malaria areas [3-7]. The observed AS + AQ cure rate is also similar to those stated in other studies [16-18]. The significantly higher under 5 year old children in the AS + AQ group would have possibly led to a lower inability to clear malarial parasites in the AS + AQ group as a result of their relatively low immunity. The loss to follow up rate was also significantly higher in the AS + SMP group than the AS + AQ group (21 versus 12) this may not be related to the drug efficacy as these losses were mainly due to movement to and from schools as well as other family social issues. The fact that 3,500 children had to be screened in order to attain the postulated sample size of 250 children per treatment arm suggests that a high proportion of the cases of fever in children are not due to malaria infection, but e.g. due to bacterial infections [9]. On the field, in the absence of parasitological confirmation, the anti-microbial profile of the SMP component of AS + SMP would have provided clinical benefits to such children even if malaria would have been wrongly diagnosed.",1
4,25,"Gametocyte carriage before and following treatment were similar in the two treatment arms, which is expected to be the result of the action of artesunate [19]. Interestingly, sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) was shown to increase gametocyte carriage following treatment of uncomplicated malaria infection [20], but this does not seem to be the case for SMP. In fact, Sowunmi et al reported that, despite slower clearance of sexual parasitaemia in children treated with AQ + SMP compared with those treated with AL, treatment with the former was not associated with increased gametocyte carriage [19].",1
4,26,"Both AS + SMP and AS + AQ treatments were well tolerated and the frequency of reported adverse events was similar in the two treatment arms. In reality, the reported adverse events were difficult to distinguish from signs and symptoms of malaria. It is notable that the reported frequency of those with itching treated with AS + AQ was low, similar to what was previously reported by Sowunmi et al in 1989 [21]. Serious adverse events such as icterus or intravascular haemolysis were not reported by any of the children. However the packed cell volume on follow up was found to be significantly lower in patients treated with AS + SMP and this may be related to high frequency (23.9% in males and 4.6% in females) of glucose six phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in the study area [22]. This would have been substantiated if all patients were screened for G6PD Deficiency.",1
4,27,"In summary, this study demonstrates that AS + SMP FDC given as three doses over 24 hours (12-hour intervals) has similar efficacy as AS + AQ FDC given as three doses over 48 hours (24-hour interval) in terms of fever and parasite clearance for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children in Nigeria. Both drugs also proved to be safe though AS + SMP has a higher re-infection rate. AS + SMP represents a good alternative to recommended first line treatments in areas where these are not available, or only offered at high costs. A continuous surveillance on the development of drug resistance is however essential as a result of potential cross resistance between SP and SMP.",1
5,1,"Chronic depression represents a public health worldwide problem. Despite the existence of several drugs for depression treatment, these medicines have many significant adverse effects, and many patients do not display satisfactory responses to the current therapeutic arsenal [1]. The etiology of depression is incompletely understood, and this precludes development of more effective drugs. Compelling literature data suggests a crosstalk between immunological changes and major depression [2,3]. It has been demonstrated that systemic administration of pro-inflammatory cytokines or some bacterial products to rodents elicits a condition described as sickness behavior, characterized by decreased food consumption and locomotor activity, social isolation, and changes in the circadian cycle, which is followed by depressive behavior [3-5].",1
5,2,"Toll-like receptors (TLR) are recognition units that distinguish microbial structures. Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) commonly signals through TLR4, leading to activation of several intracellular pathways [6]. It has been demonstrated that depression-like behavior induced by LPS in rodents is dependent on cytokine production; importantly, depressed patients display elevated cytokine plasma levels [2,3]. Furthermore, it has been recently shown that TLR activation following infection can induce systemic inflammation, accompanied by signs of brain-controlled illness in rats [7,8].",1
5,3,"Kinins are a group of peptides that are rapidly generated in response to several stimuli [9]. Once released, kinins activate two G protein-coupled receptors, called B1 and B2. B2 receptors are constitutively expressed throughout several tissues, whereas B1 receptors are not commonly expressed under normal conditions, although they are rapidly upregulated after infection, trauma, or by certain cytokines [10-13]. Of relevance, a series of previous publications has demonstrated an important role for TNFa in the up-regulation of kinin B1 receptors [14-17]. Therefore, B1 receptors are likely induced under certain pathological conditions, being involved in several chronic inflammatory and pain processes [9,10].",1
5,4,"Previous studies have demonstrated that LPS from either E. coli or P. gingivalis can induce a marked up-regulation of kinin B1 receptors in animal models of peripheral inflammation, via cytokine production [14,15,18]. Of relevance, recent studies also suggest that kinin B1 receptors have also been implicated in some diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS), such as epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease and neuropathic pain [19-21]. Taking into account the above mentioned data, the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that kinin B1 receptors might be implicated in depression-like behavioral changes elicited by systemic administration of E. coli LPS, in mice submitted to a previous stressing forced swimming session. This experimental protocol was based on the concept that internal and external stressors are able to interact, culminating in a general illness state, which causes an allostatic overload [2,22,23]. Efforts have also been made to define some of the mechanisms responsible for B1 receptor induction in the context of LPS-treated depressed animals by using biochemical and molecular techniques, such as flow cytometry, ELISA and real-time PCR. We have also aimed at determining whether antagonism of kinin B1 receptors could modulate glial activity, throughout immunohistochemical studies.",1

CF1 mice were obtained from the central animal house of the Universidade Federal de Pelotas (UFPEL, Brazil). C57/BL6 wild-type, or TNFa p55 receptor knockout mice were supplied by the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG, Belo Horizonte, Brazil). All experiments were performed between 08:00 AM and 08:00 PM. Experiments were conducted in accordance with current guidelines for the care of laboratory animals and ethical guidelines for the investigation of experimental pain in conscious animals laid down by Zimmermann (1983) [24]. All the experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committees of Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (SC) and Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul (RS).",1
5,7,"As a pre-stressful stimulus, the animals were subjected to forced swimming for 5 min, in a water temperature of 23 ± 1°C.

5,9,"To verify the involvement of kinin receptors in the behavioral changes elicited by LPS from E. coli, the animals were treated with one of the following drugs before behavioral tests: the selective antagonists of kinin B1 receptor SSR240612 (5 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min; or 10 mg/kg, p.o., 1 h) or R-715 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min), or the selective kinin B2 receptor antagonist FR173657 (30 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min). The classical tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min) was used as a positive control drug. Control animals received saline solution (0.9% NaCl solution, 10 ml/kg), at the corresponding schedules of treatment used for the antagonists. For molecular biology and immunohistochemical studies, animals were treated with SSR240612 (5 mg/kg, i.p.), 30 min before LPS, and were sacrificed at defined time-points as described in the next sections.

The protocol used in our study was adapted from the method described by Strakaliva et al, 2004 [29]. For three days, mice received 1% sucrose solution, and they were subjected to forced swimming, twice a day, for a total of six sessions (temperature water 16 to 19°C, for 5 min), as a pre-stressful stimuli. After the last swimming session, mice were treated with LPS from E. coli (450 μg/kg, i.p), followed by a 24-h period of food and water deprivation, according to the original protocol [29]. Sucrose intake was assessed for 12 h, where mice had free access to two bottles, one with 1% sucrose solution and another with tap water. The weight differences of bottles were used to calculate the consumption of sucrose with the following formula: % sucrose intake = [sucrose intake (g)] × 100/[sucrose intake (g) + tap water (g)]. The animals were treated with the selective kinin B1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 (10 mg/kg, p.o., 1 h) or the antidepressant imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min), both administered before LPS injection.

To this end, approximately 100 ng of cDNA were amplified in duplicates using TaqMan-based chemistry with specific primers and FAM-labeled probes for mouse BDNF (cat# Mm00432069_m1), B1 receptor (cat# Mm00432059_s1) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; cat# Mm03302249_g1) as the endogenous control for normalization. Amplifications were carried out in a Thermalcycler (StepOne Plus, Applied Biosystems) for 50 cycles; the fluorescence was collected at each amplification cycle and the data analyzed using the 2-ΔΔCt method for relative quantification. Expression of the target genes was calibrated against conditions found in naive animals, i.e., nontreated mice.",1
5,16,"Brain samples were collected 24 h following LPS treatment, and fixed in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the samples were submitted to standard histological proceeding in order to be embedded in paraffin. Hippocampus sections were cut approximately at the level of 3 mm from bregma [2,31]. To determine glial activity, immunohistochemistry was carried out on paraffin tissue sections using CD68 antibody (1:150; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA). Following quenching of endogenous peroxidase with 1.5% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 20 min, high temperature antigen retrieval was performed by immersion of the slides in a water bath at 95 to 98°C in 10 mM trisodium citrate buffer pH 6.0, for 45 min. After overnight incubation at 4°C with the primary antibody, the slides were washed with PBS, incubated with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody (Dako Cytomation), and then processed using the Streptavidin-HRP reagent (Dako Cytomation), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were developed with DAB (3,3’-diaminobenzidine) (Dako Cytomation) in chromogen solution and counterstained with Harris’s hematoxylin. Control and experimental tissues were placed on the same slide and processed under the same conditions.",1
5,17,"Images were acquired by Sight DS-5M-L1 digital camera connected to a light microscope Eclipse - 80i (Nikon). Settings for image acquisition were identical for control and experimental tissues. For each mouse, the number of CD-68 positive cells was counted in four different fields of CA1, CA2, CA3 and dentate girus (DG) hippocampal sub regions, using 40X magnification.",1
5,18,"The animals were submitted to forced swimming and treated with LPS from E. coli, as described before. Subsequently, they were euthanized by decapitation at distinct intervals of time following LPS (1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h). TNFa levels were determined in serum or in whole brain by means of a standard sandwich ELISA technique, according to the recommendations of the supplier (R&D Systems, USA). For the brain assays, the tissues were removed and placed in a PBS solution containing 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM benzamethonium chloride, 10 mM EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin A, and 0.5% BSA. The mouse brains were homogenized and then centrifuged at 3,000× g for 10 min, and the supernatant was employed for ELISA analysis.",1
5,19,"Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) samples were taken from the cisterna magna using a method adapted from Liu and Duff [32]. Mice were submitted to forced swimming and treated with LPS from E. coli (450 μg/kg, i.p.), as described before. One, three or twenty four h after treatment, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg; i.p.) and xylazine (10 mg/kg; i.p.), and placed on stereotaxic instrument. The head was positioned in a 135° angle with the body, and a sagittal incision of the skin was made inferior to the occiput. To aspirate the CSF, the metal part of an insulin needle was adapted at one end of a polyethylene 50 tubing, and at the other end a 50 μl Hamilton syringe was attached. The needle was attached to the bottom end of the manipulator bar, and 3 mm of it was inserted into the cisterna magna. The CSF collected was transferred to a 0.5 ml Eppendorf tube, and frozen immediately on dry ice and then kept into -80°C until use. CSF from naïve animals was used as control.",1
5,20,"The BD Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) was used to quantitatively measure cytokines in the CSF. The CBA Mouse Inflammation Kit® (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions to simultaneously detect interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interferon-g (IFN-g), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), and interleukin-12p70 (IL-12p70). Flow cytometer readings were performed using FACSCanto II red laser in a medium range of 633 nm. Data were acquired using FACSDiva software and analyzed using FCAP Array software (all from BD Bioscience). The captured cytokines were detected via direct immunoassay using six different antibodies coupled to phycoerythrin (PE). Standard curves were generated for each cytokine using the mixed cytokine beads standard provided by the kit. The concentration of the standards ranged from 20 to 5000 pg/ml. Five standard curves were plotted such as: cytokine concentration X mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), using a four-parameter logistic curve fitting model. The concentrations of each CSF cytokine were determined from these four-parameter equations using the MFI value of each cytokine. If a sample had a cytokine concentration below the detection limit for the assay, a value of 0 was assigned for that concentration.",1
5,21,"For the behavioral parameters and Elisa protocols, the results are presented as the mean ± SEM of 6 to 8 animals. For the real-time PCR, flow cytometry and immunohistochemical experiments, the results are given as the mean ± SEM of 4 independent experiments, performed in triplicate. The statistical comparison between these values was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc test. P values less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) were considered as indicative of significance.",1
5,22,"The results depicted in Figure 1a demonstrate that systemic administration of E. coli LPS (450 μg/kg, i.p.), following a 5-min forced swimming session, elicited time-related depression-like behavior in mice, according to assessment in the tail-suspension paradigm. The increase of immobility time in animals pre-treated with LPS was statistically significant at 24 h (P < 0.01), but not at 6 h (P > 0.05; results not shown), returning to control levels at 48 h (P < 0.05), in comparison to saline-treated mice. As could be expected, treatment with the classical antidepressant drug imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), given 30 min before the behavioral assessment, produced a marked reduction of the immobility time (47 ± 16% of reduction; Figure 1a). Of interest, i.p. treatment with the selective B1 receptor antagonists R-715 (0.5 mg/kg, 30 min) or SSR240612 (5 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min), or even oral administration of SSR240612 (10 mg/kg, 1 h), caused a significant inhibition of depression-like behavior induced by LPS (Figure 1c). The percentages of inhibition for animals treated with B1 receptor antagonists were: 46 ± 6%, 33 ± 7% and 30 ± 6%, respectively. On the other hand, the selective kinin B2 receptor antagonist FR173657 (30 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min) failed to significantly alter the immobility time in our model (P > 0.05; Figure 1b).",1
5,23,"It is well known that LPS treatment evokes some classical CNS-associated changes in rodents [3-5]. Confirming literature data, our results demonstrate that E. coli LPS administration in mice previously submitted to forced swimming, is able to cause a marked reduction of body temperature (Figure 1e), and of locomotor activity when assessed in the open-field arena. The locomotor activity was significantly reduced at 6 h after LPS (P < 0.05), returning to the control levels at 24 h (Figure 1f). Body temperature was found significantly reduced at 6 h (P < 0.01), but not at 24 h after LPS (P > 0.05). Remarkably, the administration of R-715 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), 30 min before the test, did not display any significant effect on this parameter as assessed at 6 h (Figure 1e). Considering the oral bioavailability of SSR240612, the next experiments were carried out using only this antagonist.",1
5,24,"We wondered whether the effects of selective kinin B1 receptor antagonists might be related to changes of B1 receptor expression in CNS structures. Therefore, B1 receptor mRNA expression was measured in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice submitted to a session of forced swimming, followed by LPS administration (450 μg/kg, i.p.). Quantitative real-time experiments revealed a time-dependent, marked increase in B1 receptor mRNA levels in hippocampus, which peaked at 1 h (about 2.5-fold increase) (Figure 2a) while in the cortex this increase was almost 40 fold 1 h after LPS treatment (Figure 2b).",1
5,25,"As observed in Figure 3, forced swimming followed by LPS treatment produced a marked increase in CD68 immunoreactivity in mouse hippocampus, indicative of increased glial cell activation. Of relevance, CD68 labeling was almost completely inhibited in animals pre-treated with the selective kinin B 1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 (5 mg/kg, i.p.), but not by the antidepressant drug imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), both given 30 min before LPS. These findings suggest that different mechanisms appear to mediate imipramine and kinin B1 receptor antagonist antidepressant-like effects. It has been described that depression is associated with decreased expression of neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF [33-35]. In our study, real-time PCR experiments revealed a marked decrease in BDNF expression in hippocampus of mice submitted to our protocol of depression, when assessed at both the 6- and the 24-h timepoints (an approximate 50% reduction). However, this parameter was not significantly affected by pre-treating animals with the kinin B 1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 (5 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min) (Figure 4).",1
5,26,"Next, in order to correlate the changes elicited by LPS with cytokine production, we assessed levels of TNFa in whole brain or mouse serum. The animals were submitted to a forced swimming session and treated with E. coli LPS, as described above. This series of results showed the occurrence of a marked, time-dependent increase in TNFa production, either in brain or in serum of LPStreated mice. In serum, TNFa levels peaked between 1 and 3 h (an approximate 90-fold increase), returning to basal levels 6 h following LPS administration (Figure 5a). The increase of TNFa in the brain was maximal between 3 and 6 h after LPS (about 1.8-fold augmentation), being reduced to control values after 12 h (Figure 5b). We also analyzed cytokine content in CSF from LPS-treated mice, using flow cytometry analysis. The cytokines IL-6, IL-10, IFN-g were below detection levels, while the concentration of IL-12 was similar to that observed in naïve animals (data not shown). Of interest, CSF TNFa levels peaked 1 h after LPS injection and remained elevated until 3 h later (about 340 and 90-fold increase, respectively) (Figure 5c).",1
5,27,"Since previous literature data have shown a close interrelation between TNFa and B1 receptor upregulation [10,14], we further investigated the role played by TNFa in the depression-like behavior observed in our experimental paradigm. For that purpose, we employed TNFa p55 receptor-deficient mice. As TNFa p55 receptor knockout animals used in the present study are C57/BL6 inbred, we employed this mouse strain in this part of the study. In C57/BL6 mice, a dose of 1000 μg/kg of E. coli LPS was necessary to evoke a significant increase in immobility time in the tail-suspension test, comparable to that obtained with a 450 μg/kg dose in CF1 mice (about 1.5-fold in relation to saline-treated animals). Strikingly, the depression-like behavior caused by forced swimming plus LPS treatment (1000 μg/kg, i.p.) was virtually abolished in mice with genetic deletion of TNFa p55 receptors (Figure 5d). Of note, the increase of B1 receptor mRNA expression in mice submitted to forced swimming plus LPS treatment was completely absent in TNFa p55 receptor knockout animals (Figure 5e).",1
5,28,"During the last few years, several advances have been achieved in our understanding of the genetic, biochemical and immunological changes implicated in depression [35]. Concerning the immunological mechanisms, certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly IL-6, IL-1b and TNFa, have been recently pointed out as pivotal molecules for depression-related behaviors following infection. These cytokines are likely able to coordinate local and systemic inflammatory responses to pathogens [2,22]. In the depression-like behavioral paradigm employed herein, we demonstrate that administration of LPS (450 μg/kg, i.p.) in mice previously submitted to a 5-min swimming session, produces earlier signals of sickness behavior, such as decreased body temperature and locomotor activity 6 h post-LPS, which are followed by a later manifestation of depression-like behavior, i.e. an increase of immobility time in the tail suspension test, 24 h post-LPS. This is in line with literature data indicating that sickness behavior represents a normal initial response to infectious stimuli [33,36], although depression-like states might persist after initial sickness alterations have resolved [3,37].",1
5,29,"To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study correlating kinin B 1 receptors and depression. These receptors are commonly absent under normal conditions in the periphery, but might be rapidly up-regulated by stressful stimuli. Interestingly, basal expression of B 1 receptor has been described in spinal cord and some brain structures, such as cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and choroid plexus epithelial cells [10,38,39]. Even though the exact role of kinins in the brain is not clear, basal expression of B1 receptor in the nervous system is compellingly suggestive of a central role for these molecules [10,19,40]. Herein, we have assessed whether B1 receptors might be implicated in the depression-like behavior induced by LPS and pre-stressful stimuli.",1
5,30,"The depression-like state observed in the tail suspension test was significantly reduced by the antidepressant imipramine, in a dose which was effective in stressed rodents [27]. Interestingly, the increased immobility was significantly inhibited by treatment with either selective B1 receptor antagonists R-715 or SSR240612. These results are indicative of a relevant role for B1 receptors in depression-like behavior. Our in vivo data were reinforced by real-time PCR experiments, which demonstrated a marked increase in B 1 receptor mRNA expression in hippocampus, and notably, in the cortex of mice submitted to forced swimming plus LPS administration. Alterations of hippocampal plasticity have been widely demonstrated in depression associated with stressful insults [32,40-42]. Nevertheless, the present study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration that infection associated with a stressful stimulus might up-regulate B1 receptors in the CNS, leading to depressive behavior. Conversely, treatment of mice with the selective B2 receptor antagonist FR173657 failed to significantly affect immobility time in our depression paradigm. This is well aligned with the proposed physiological roles of kinin B 2 receptors [43]. Considering this paradigm, the participation of B2 receptors was not further considered in the present study.",1
5,31,"Of high interest, functional data obtained in the tail suspension test was extended by results employing the anhedonia paradigm of sucrose intake, in which SSR240612 was able to completely reverse reduced sucrose consumption in LPS-treated mice. It is well known that depression is likely associated with anhedonia states, where pleasure sensations are reduced or even missing [29,44]. It is noteworthy that stressful forced swimming plus LPS administration resulted in a significant decrease in sucrose consumption in Swiss mice, a parameter that was reversed by the antidepressant imipramine, which reinforces the validity of our experimental design [45]. On the other hand, sickness behavior-induced hypothermia was not significantly altered by the administration of the B1 receptor antagonist R-715. This evidence indicates that blocking B1 receptors is able to reverse later depression-like symptoms without interfering with early sickness behavior, which seems to be coordinated mainly by cytokines [46].",1
5,32,"The major immunocompetent components of the CNS are represented by microglia and astrocytes, and the activation of these cells likely contributes to the pathogenesis of depression [43,47,48]. Our data clearly demonstrate that forced swimming followed by LPS treatment results in activation of microglia in mice, as indicated by an enhancement of CD-68 immunostaining in hippocampus 24 h after LPS injection, when B1 mRNA levels return to basal. It has been demonstrated that microglial activation in response to several kinds of injury drives the release of neurotoxic mediators, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines [3,49]. Of relevance, systemic treatment with the selective non-peptide B1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 virtually abolished the CD-68 immunopositivity, but notably this parameter was not significantly altered by imipramine. This allows us to suggest that antidepressant-like effects of B 1 receptor antagonists, but not that caused by imipramine, are related to inhibition of microglial activation. These findings are quite relevant and open a new avenue to understand depressive states, especially those associated to infection.",1
5,33,"Depression is clearly associated with synaptic plasticity changes, resulting in decreased BDNF function, among other biochemical alterations. It has been demonstrated that under stressful conditions, the BDNF gene is repressed leading to neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus [40,50]. Of interest, BDNF infusion in some brain regions induces antidepressant-like effects in animal models [50-52]. Additionally, most monoaminergic antidepressant drugs are known to restore normal BDNF transcriptional levels [33-35,34]. Our depression model caused a sustained reduction in BDNF mRNA expression in hippocampus (up to 24 h). Of note, BDNF mRNA expression was not significantly altered by previous administration of the selective B 1 receptor antagonist SSR240612. Therefore, although B1 receptor antagonism prevented microglial activation, it failed to restore decreased brain levels of BDNF. These results suggest that SSR240612 seems to have an antidepressant-like activity by acting through different mechanisms from usual antidepressants; acting preferentially by an inflammatory pathway, and not by interfering with BDNF.",1
5,34,"As mentioned above, pro-inflammatory cytokines are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of depression [53,54]. Of note, patients with major depressive disorder have increased expression of soluble TNFa receptors [55,56], and patients under treatment with TNFa antagonists display a general improvement of depressive symptoms and life quality [57,58]. Herein, we reinforce this hypothesis by demonstrating that LPS administration in pre-stressed mice results in a marked increase of TNFa levels in serum, CSF and whole brain. TNFa production was initially augmented in serum (between 1 and 3 h), and later increased in whole brain (between 3 and 6 h). Therefore, it is possible to argue that increased TNFa levels in serum are the main factor responsible for sickness behavioral changes (i.e. hypothermia and reduced locomotor activity), whereas the elevation of this cytokine in brain underlies the depression-like behavior in the tail suspension test. In addition, multiplex cytokine analysis demonstrated a marked increase of TNFa levels in CSF obtained from LPS-treated mice (between 1 and 3 h), although the levels of other cytokines remained unaltered.",1
5,35,"The presence of TNFa in the CSF supports the idea of a communication pathway between the brain and the immune system. When toll-like receptors on macrophage-like cells residing in the circumventricular receptors are activated, they respond by producing proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFa [3]. As the circumventricular organs lie outside the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and the BBB is relatively impermeable to cytokines, the mechanisms by which circulating cytokines might influence the brain function remain a matter of debate [34]. One established theory is that they can enter the brain by volume diffusion [3,58,58]. Cytokines might additionally gain access to the brain through sites where BBB is somewhat compromised, e.g. by stressful events or immunologic challenges, such as those used in our protocol [34]. Besides, kinins enhance permeability of BBB. This would disturb BBB functioning, leading to various neuropathological conditions related to cytokine entrance into the brain, including depression [59,60].",1
5,36,"To gain further insights into the relevance of TNFa in our experimental paradigm, we employed TNFa p55 receptor-KO mice. Both depression-like behavior and upregulation of B1 receptors induced by forced swimming plus LPS treatment were virtually abolished in TNFa p55 receptor-KO mice. The relevance of TNFa for the up-regulation of B1 receptors has been described before by our group [14-17]. The experimental evidence provided herein clearly suggests a link between the cytokine TNFa and the kinin B 1 receptor upregulation in depression genesis. The present data provide good evidence suggesting that generation of this pro-inflammatory cytokine seems to exert a critical role for LPS to induce B1 receptor upregulation, as already demonstrated [14].",1
5,37,"Most experts agree that depression should be viewed as a syndrome, not a disease [60]. The current hypothesis linking depression and the immune system suggests that cytokines and other immune mediators work as ‘’sensor’’ molecules, capable of transforming noncognitive stimuli (i.e. inflammatory process) into cognitive stimuli, allowing the CNS to recognize them, and to elaborate an integrated response to the peripheral event. Therefore, molecules released during peripheral inflammatory events may influence central factors controlling homeostasis and behavior [58,59]. Our findings bring a new piece of evidence into the depression disorder puzzle which may help to understand its etiology: kinin B1 receptors might exert a critical role in affective disorders, such as depression. The participation of B1 receptors in depressive alterations seems to be related to microglial activation, an event that seems to be associated with the subsequent production of TNFa in the brain. It is tempting to suggest that a clinical trial with orally available selective B1 receptor antagonists should be performed to evaluate whether or not these molecules could help treating clinical symptoms of depression.",1
6,1,"Type I interferons (IFNs) play an essential role in both the innate immune response and the induction of adaptive immunity against viral infections. Viral infections trigger the production of type I IFNs (IFN-a/b) [1,2], which leads to the activation of several hundred IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These genes encode a variety of antiviral proteins and cytokines, leading to the protection of the host from further viral infections [3,4].",1
6,2,"The main viral sensors in most mammalian nucleated cells are RNA helicases, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5), which recognises viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) [1,5-9]. Many cells also recognise viral dsRNA through Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) [1,10]. The binding of virus-derived nucleic acids to RIG-I, MDA-5 or TLR3 results in a coordinated activation of the transcription factor kappa B (NF-kB) interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), leading to IFN-b production in mammals [6,7,10].",1
6,3,"Although a variety of cellular signalling has been evolved in host cells for detecting and responding to viral infection, most viruses possess mechanisms to evade these host immune responses to various degrees [7,11]. For example, many viruses have developed a multitude of mechanisms to evade the IFN response by either blocking IFN synthesis or interfering with the functions of IFN [12].",1
6,4,"In the case of influenza A viruses, the non-structural gene (NS) has been shown to be responsible for viral anti-IFN activities [13-16]. The NS gene of influenza A viruses encodes for two proteins [17]. The first is through the translation of unspliced mRNA, which encodes a protein of 26 kDa known as non-structural protein 1 (NS1). The second is a 14 kDa nuclear export protein (NEP, formerly called NS2) translated from spliced mRNA [18].",1
6,5,"The NS1 protein antagonises both the induction of IFN-b [19,20] and the activity of several IFN-induced proteins with antiviral activities such as protein kinase R (PKR) and 2’-5’oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) [21-23].",1
6,6,"The NS gene can be classified into separate gene pools, termed alleles A and B [24,25]. Between allele A and B, 63-68% nucleotide identity and 66-70% amino acid identity was found between the NS1 proteins. The NS allele A is more common and is the only subtype found in mammalian-adapted isolates. In a comparison between amino acid sequence of avian allele A and B viruses with an amino acid sequence of human viruses, six amino acid motifs, or signatures, were found between human and avian allele A viruses, and 35 signatures between human and allele B viruses, indicating that allele B viruses are more distinct from mammalian origin viruses [26]. This suggests that the adaptation of NS1 plays an important role in the pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses in mammalian species.",1
6,7,"In our previous study concerning the genetic relationship among H10 avian influenza viruses with different pathogenicity in mink (Mustela vison), we found that these differences were related to amino acid variations in the NS1 protein. We demonstrated that in a model system using polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)stimulated mink lung cells, the NS1 protein of influenza A virus isolated from mink (A/mink/Sweden/84 (H10N4)) down regulated type I IFN promoter activity to a greater extent than the NS1 protein of prototype H10 virus (known as virus/N (A/chicken/Germany/N/49 (H10N7)) [27].",1
6,8,"In this study, we extend our previous work to further investigate the effect of the NS1 from different gene pools on type I IFN promoter activity, the production of IFN-b, as well as the expression of the IFN-b mRNA in response to poly I:C.",1
6,9,"First, we studied the ability of NS1 from “mink/84” and “chicken/49” to inhibit the induction of transcription of the IFN-b gene, using the model system ISRE-Luciferase and Poly I:C stimulation. This reporter system relies on expression of IFN and the subsequent signalling from the IFN-a/b receptor leading to expression from the ISRE reporter gene (luciferase). Although both NS1 from “mink/84” and “chicken/49” showed a significant suppressive effect on the luciferase activity, it was considerably stronger in cells transfected with “mink/84” with an average of 6.8 fold decrease (85.3%) in A549 cells (Figure 1A), compared with “chicken/49”, that on average produced a 20.8% decrease in A549 cells.",1
6,10,"To find out whether the difference in inhibition of IFNb promoter is duo to difference in- or insufficient expression of the NS1 proteins in A549 cells, the level of expressed NS1 proteins was confirmed by western blot analysis. The cells were lysed at 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24 hours post transfection and western blotting was performed. The NS1 proteins from both constructs were expressed in high quantity and the level of allele A NS1 was comparable to NS1 protein of allele B (Figure 1B). The western blotting showed that the expressed protein from both “mink/84” and “chicken/49” was homogenously accumulated in A549 cells and there was no notable difference between alleles in term of NS1 production (Figure 1B). Thus, the results indicated that the difference in IFN-b induction in the presence of allele B NS1 protein was not due to difference in allele B NS1 protein expression and accumulation in the cells.",1
6,11,"At this point it was not clear if this result corresponded to differences in the ability to downregulate IFN production, or that the signalling pathway leading to ISRE transcription is influenced, or both. To sort out this, IFN protein production was measured by an ELISA.",1
6,12,"The IFN-b protein was detected in the cell medium of the control cells after a lag of 2 to 4 hours after poly I:C stimulation, followed by the linear accumulation of IFNb in the cell culture supernatant. The peak yields for control cells were reached about 16 to 24 hours poststimulation (Figure 2A). Although low levels of IFN-b were secreted by cells transfected with different NS1s, significant differences were observed between these NS1s. Those cells expressing the NS1 protein of “mink/84” virus were weak producers of IFN-b, with at least 10 times lower levels of IFN-b secreted in the cell culture supernatant than the control cells. In these cells IFN-b secreted to the supernatant reached the maximum yield 8 hours post-stimulation and declined rapidly to a low level for the rest of the experiment. By contrast, cells expressing the NS1 protein of “chicken/49” were better producers of IFN-b with the profile lower but similar to that observed with the control cells (Figure 2A). This indicates that NS1, in this system, suppresses IFN protein production rather than the signalling from the IFN receptor.",1
6,13,"To determine whether the reduction of IFN-b production was caused by the suppression of the expression of the IFN-b gene, we compared gene expression kinetics in A549 cells stimulated with poly I:C in the presence or absence of different NS1 proteins.",1
6,14,"In the control cells, IFN-b mRNA was detected in increased amounts during the entire period of the experiment (Figure 2B). The same profile was observed in the cells expressing the NS gene of “chicken/49 ” (Figure 2C). Transcript levels in the control cells were significantly increased 2 to 4 hours post-stimulation, reaching a plateau at the end of the experiment. Four hours after stimulation, the NS1 protein of the “mink/84” effectively suppressed IFN-b gene transcription in A549 cells (Figure 2D). The activation of the IFN-b gene expression in cells transfected with plasmids carrying the NS gene of “chicken/49” resulted in increased levels of IFN-b mRNA showing the same trend similar to the control cells.",1
6,15,"The RT-PCR analysis of the INF-b mRNA presented in the stimulated A549 cells expressing NS1 of “mink/84” or “chicken/49” confirmed that the NS1 protein of “mink/84” effectively suppressed IFN-b gene transcription in A549 cells, indicating that the main target of the “mink/84” NS1 is the induction of IFN.",1
6,16,"One of the main strategies of the influenza A viruses to avoid host immune responses is to inhibit IFN-a/b expression or signalling to the neighbouring cells, which induce their antiviral state by the stimulation of transcription from the ISRE promoter-containing genes [28]. The viral NS1 of influenza A viruses is known to be an important regulator of innate immunity on many levels [13-16]. The NS1 inhibits host immune responses through two functional domains: an N-terminal RNA binding domain and a C-terminal effector domain [19]. The effector domain interacts with proteins involved in the 3’-end cellular mRNA processing, inhibits mRNA export and pre-mRNA splicing of host cell transcripts and interacts with components of the nuclear pore complex as well as the mRNA export machinery [29-34]. The N-terminal RNA binding domain binds to both single- and double-stranded RNA that might inhibit the activation and/or signalling of antiviral proteins, such as RIG-I, PKR, OAS/RNase L, activators of mitogenactivated protein kinase and transcription factors involved in type I IFN and inflammatory cytokine signalling [20,22,23,35-37].",1
6,17,"Our previous study indicated that the NS1 protein is a potential key factor for the different pathogenicity levels of the H10 avian influenza viruses in mink (Mustela vison) [27]. In this study, we applied an expression plasmid system carrying the ORF of NS1 of two avian influenza viruses, showing the difference in pathogenicity in mink [38]. Furthermore, these viruses represent different NS alleles, one from A (""mink/84”) and the other one from B (""chicken/49”). A comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of the two NS1 proteins showed 71 amino acid differences (Figure 3). However, the two NS1 proteins were found to be very similar regarding the previously identified important amino acid residues for the function of NS1 protein in the infected cells [23,29,30,34,39,40].",1
6,18,"Notably, the only difference was found in the site important for the NS1 protein’s interaction with the 30kDa subunit of cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30) [27]. The NS1 protein interaction with the CPSF30 inhibits 3’-end processing of cellular premRNA [29,30,34]. This function is mediated by two distinct domains: one around residue 186 [30] and the other around residues 103 and 106 [41]. The NS1 protein of “mink/84” possessed the amino acid Glu186, Phe103 and Met106, whereas the NS1 protein of “chicken/49” possessed Tyr 103. A previous study [41] showed that mutations at the NS1 protein CPSF30 interaction sites dramatically changed the effect of the NS1 to control host gene expression.",1
6,19,"Both “mink/84” and “chicken/49” NS1s had a negative effect on the activation of the ISRE promoter, as shown by the luciferase activity. But the reduction was much stronger in cells transfected with the “mink/84” NS1 plasmid with an average of 85.3% decrease in A549 cells (Figure 1A), whereas pNS-chicken/49 on average produced a 20.8% decrease in A549 cells. As this final product is dependent on both the induction of IFN and luciferase from the IFN receptor, the exact mechanism by which this interference is mediated through can be either by inhibiting IFN induction signals via RIG-I, MDA-5 or TRL-3, the processing of IFN mRNA, or the downstream effects via IFN receptor signalling or luciferase mRNA processing.",1
6,20,Several studies have indicated that the blocking of virus-induced IFN-b promoter activation is mediated by the N-terminal RNA binding domain of the NS1 protein [42-44]. The 71 amino acid differences between the two NS1 proteins will most likely result in differences on the three-dimensional structure of the NS1 protein that could affect the function of NS1 in the suppression of IFN-b promoter activation.,1
6,21,"Since the induction of the IFN-b promoter is associated with the production of IFN-b, we next investigated the level of endogenous IFN-b mRNA and the amount of IFN-b secreted in the cell supernatant. It has been observed that the NS1 protein of “mink/84” but not “chicken/49” strongly suppressed the expression of the IFN-b gene and secretion of IFN-b in the cell culture supernatant. In the time course study using A549 cells stimulated with poly I:C, IFN-b production displayed three distinct phases. After an initial rapid increase it reached a peak and then declined to lower levels. The production of IFN-b by poly I:C stimulation in A549 cells displayed a 2- to 4-hours lag followed by a steady increase in the accumulation of secreted IFN-b in the cell culture media. Maximal yields were observed at 16 to 24 h post poly I:C stimulation (Figure 2A). Similar observations were made when mRNA levels were measured. The expression during poly I:C stimulation revealed an early up regulation of IFN-b transcripts starting at or before 2 h with a peak at 18-24 h after stimulation. During the first 4 h post-stimulation, we observed an up regulation of IFN-b mRNA transcripts in A549 cells expressing the NS1 protein of “mink/84”.",1
6,22,"Future experiments are required to investigate the exact molecular mechanism behind this observation. This may require the use of animal experiments and also includes tools like reverse genetics, genomics and proteomic tools that allows the analysis of many parameters involved in the complex interplay between the NS1 and the host innate immune machinery.",1
6,23,"All these observations indicate that different nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza viruses, one from allele A and another from allele B, show different abilities to suppress the induction of IFN mRNA; however, the exact mechanism is unknown. The results also demonstrate that the production of an important cytokine, IFN-b is affected by the function of NS1 protein from different genetic gene pools.",1
6,24,"It is possible that NS1 interacts with one of the inducing pathways, or both, or that the mRNA processing is blocked. The latter can be studied by investigating another inducible gene other than an IFN-dependent one.",1
6,25,"After establishing an assay protocol for different part of our study, both NS1 construct were tested in duplicate at three independent experiments (each experiment was set up separately and carried out on different days).",1
6,26,"The NS1 open reading frames (ORF) of influenza A virus strains A/mink/Sweden/3900/84 (""mink/84”) and A/chicken/Germany/N/49 (""chicken/49”) were amplified using the primers NS1Kpn 5’ (5’-ATTCGGTACCAGCAAAAGCAGGGTGACAAAG-3’) and NS1XhoI 3’ (5’TACCCTCGATAGAAACAAGGGTGTTTTTTAT-3’). Twenty-five microliter PCR-mix contained 1xPlatinum Taq buffer (Invitrogen), 200 μM dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl2, (Invitrogen) and 3 μl cDNA. Reactions were placed in a thermal cycler at 95°C for 2 min, then cycled 35 times between 95°C 20 sec, annealing at 58°C for 60 sec and elongation at 72°C for 90 sec and were finally kept at 8° C until later use.",1
6,27,"The 690 bp PCR products were digested with Kpn and XhoI and cloned between the Kpn and XhoI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), creating pNS-mink/84 and pNS-chicken/49 plasmid respectively. The integrity of the plasmids was confirmed by sequencing.",1
6,28,"A549 cells, a type II alveolar epithelial cell line from human adenocarcinoma, (ATCC, CCL 185) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and supplemented with 10% FCS in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.",1
6,29,Transcriptional activity was assayed in the A549 cells. Cells were co-transfected with plasmids containing either the NS gene of “mink/84” or “chicken/49” together with reporter plasmids driving expression of Firefly luciferase (pISRE-TA-Luc) (Invitrogen) under the control of the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE). The pRen-Luc plasmid containing the Renilla luciferase gene (Invitrogen) was used as internal control. The activity of the reporter gene were standardised by the Renilla luciferase activity. The inhibitory effect in cells expressing the various NS1s was expressed in folds of luciferase activity.,1
6,30,"The transfection of the plasmids was conducted with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) in six-well plates according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Initial experiments were conducted to optimise the efficiency of the transfection protocol. The day before transfection, cells were collected and seeded into six-well plates at 1 × 10 5 cells per well to achieve 70-80% confluence on the day of transfection. Each transfection group consisted of six wells in which three were poly I:C stimulated and three mock treated. Stimulation of the cells with the poly I:C was performed 24 hours after transfection of the pcDNA3.1/NS1 plasmid through the addition of 5 μg/ml poly I:C mixed in 100 μl DMEM without serum. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were harvested according to the protocol for the luciferase assay kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany), using 300 μl lysis buffer for each well. Samples were kept on ice and centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 × g to remove cell debris before measurement of the luciferase activity. Luciferase activities were measured using 20 μl of each sample according to the manufacturer’s protocol.",1
6,31,"All the transfections for western blot analysis were performed following the same protocol as described above. Briefly, cells were washed and lysed at 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24 hours post transfection using Bio-Plex cells lysis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After incubation for 20 min at 4°C and three times thawingfreezing steps at -70°C, the lysates were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 20 min. Concentration and quality of the protein were measured using Nanodrop ND1000 (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE.) and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by Coomassie blue staining. A total of 50 μg of the cell lysate was separated bySDS-PAGE in Ready Gel J 7.5% (Bio-Rad) and then electronically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). The membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (PBS, 2% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin) at room temperature for one hour on slow agitation, the NS1and bactin proteins were detected using anti-NS1 polyclonal, the NS1 antibodies was raised in goat against a peptide mapping near the C-terminus of influenza A NS1 (sc-17596, Santa Cruz Biothechnology, INC) and anti b-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, Stockholm, Sweden), followed by incubation with primary antibodies diluted in TBS-2% BSA at 4°C overnight.",1
6,32,"The concentration of IFN-b in stimulated A549 cell supernatants was determined using a commercially available VeriKine™ human IFN-beta sandwich enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (PBL interferon source, Piscataway, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cell supernatants were collected at 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 hours post-poly I:C stimulations. Briefly, microtiter strips were incubated with 100 μl of IFN standards, blanks and samples. After one hour of incubation, the strips were washed and detection antibodies were added. After incubation and an additional washing step, streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was added, and the strips were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The strips were again washed before the addition of the tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) substrate solution, after which the strips were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The reaction was terminated by the addition of stop solution, and the optical density of the wells was read at 450 nm using a microplate reader Multiscan EX (Thermo scientific, MA, USA). Values for the samples were compared to those for the standard curve and the amount of IFN-b was estimated from the standard curve.",1
6,33,"RT-PCR was used to study the level of IFN-b mRNA expression in Poly I:C-stimulated A549 cells. The housekeeping gene b-actin was used as a control. RT-PCR was performed using the following primer pairs specific to human IFN-b and b-actin mRNA: IFN-b forward 5’ GGCCATGACCAACAAGTGTCTCCTCC 3’ and reverse 5’ ACAGGTTACCTCCGAAACTGAGCGC 3’, resulting a product of 550 bp; and b-actin forward 5’ TGGGTCAGAAGGACTCCTATG 3’ and reverse 5’ AGAAGAGCTATGAGCTGCCTG 3’.

RNA was DNAse-treated and quantified and purity measured at OD260/280 using a Nanodrop ND1000 (Nanodrop Tec., Wilmington, DA, USA). All RNA samples had an OD260/280 ratio in water between 1.9 and 2.1. 2 μg RNA was used to make cDNA templates using Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and oligo-dT primers (Invitrogen).",1
7,1,"Development of an anticancer compound is always a fascinating challenge in the field of cancer chemotherapy. Research is ongoing globally to identify new leads. The anticancer activities of several substituted naphthalimides (1H-benz[de]isoquinoline-1,3-diones) are well documented [1,2]. For example, substituted naphthalimides containing N-(2,2-dimethylaminoethyl) chain best represented by Mitonafide (5-nitro group in the aromatic ring) and Amonafide (5-amino group in the aromatic ring) have been shown to possess significant anticancer activities. Both Mitonafide [3,4] and Amonafide [5,6] have undergone Phase I-II clinical trials with limited success. We have recently reported appreciable antitumor activity of some new compounds belonging to N-(2-chloroethyl)and N-(3-chloropropyl) naphthalimides [7]. From the literature search, it was found that there was no report, to our knowledge, that describes the anticancer potential of known N-(2-hydroxyethyl) and N-(3-hydroxypropyl) naphthalimides (compounds 1a-j). Hence we have undertaken the present study of evaluating their potency. In this report we have documented the findings that shows that 6-nitro-2-(3-hydroxypropyl)-1H-benz[de]isoquinoline-1,3-dione (compound 1i) is the most active member in the series.",1
7,2,"A total number of ten substituted 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)and 2-(3-hydroxypropyl)-1H-benz[de]isoquinoline-1,3diones (compounds 1a-j) (Figure 1) were prepared following established procedure. Out of these ten compounds, test compound 1i [8] was most extensively investigated. Mitonafide was received earlier as a gift from Prof. M.F. Brana, University of San Pablo-CEU, Madrid, Spain. Anticancer drugs, propidium iodide and annexin V-FITC detection kit (A2214) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA.",1
7,3,"The following human tumor cell lines namely Leukemia: acute lymphoblastic MOLT-4, promyelocytic HL-60; Lymphoma: histiocytic U-937; Breast: MCF-7; Neuroblastoma: IMR-32, SK-N-SH; Colon: 502713, COLO205, HCT-15, SW-620; Liver: Hep-2; Prostate: DU-145, PC-3 and Lung: A549 obtained either from National Centre of Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India or National Cancer Institute, Fredrick, MD, USA were used. Cell lines were grown in tissue culture flasks in RPMI-1640 medium with 2 mM glutamine (Invitrogen Corporation, USA) containing 1% antibiotics (100 units penicillin/ml and 100 μg streptomycin/ml, Cambrex Bioscience Inc., USA), pH 7.4, sterilized by filtration and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen Corporation, USA) at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% relative humidity in a CO2 incubator and routinely sub-cultured. Trypsin (0.02%) was used for dislodging adherent type cells.",1
7,4,"All the test compounds 1a-j were initially screened against U-937 and HL-60 cell lines by MTT assay as per standard procedure [9]. Compounds 1d and 1i were also screened in MOLT-4 (Table 1). Drug stock solutions (20 mg/ml) were prepared in cell culture DMSO. These were serially diluted with complete growth medium stated above to obtain different drug concentrations [final DMSO concentration was 0.5% highest to 0.001% lowest]. Cells were seeded at 1 × 10 4 (U-937), 2 × 10 4 (HL-60) or 1 × 10 5 (MOLT-4) per well in 96-well cell culture plates and incubated with respective drug solutions of different concentrations for 96 hr and processed. All vehicle controls contained same concentration of DMSO. The plate was read in a microplate reader at 540 nm. Curvefit software was used to calculate the IC 50 values. IC50 value < 10 μM is considered as active as per National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA, protocol.",1

Growth inhibition value 50% or more at 1 × 10 -5M is considered as active. Established anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin, 5-FU, cis-platin, BCNU, hydroxyurea, paclitaxel and mitomycin C were used in parallel for comparison as indicated in the respective Table 1 and 2.",1

PBMC (1 × 105 cells/well) were cultured in complete RPMI-1640 media as usual and incubated with compounds 1d and 1i for 48 hr followed by MTT assay. IC50 values were calculated using Curvefit software.",1
7,7,"The effect of compound 1i on different phases of cell cycle of MOLT-4 was explored by flow cytometry [12]. In brief, 1 × 10 6 MOLT-4 cells were incubated with compound 1i (10.0 and 16.7 μM) for 24 hr and camptothecin (5 μM) for 3 hr. The cells were next washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), harvested, fixed with ice-cold PBS in 70% ethanol, and stored at -20°C for 30 min. After fixation, the cells were incubated with RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA, 0.1 mg/ml) at 37°C for 30 min, stained with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA, 50 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice in dark and analyzed for DNA content using BD-LSR Flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, USA). Data were collected in list mode on 10,000 events and analyzed using Mod Fit 2.0 software (Figure 2).",1
7,8,"Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining method was followed [13] for the assay in MOLT-4 cells (1 × 106/well, 6-well plate) after incubation of the cells with 10.0 and 16.7 μM of compound 1i and 5 μM of camptothecin for 6 hr at 37°C (Figure 3). Similar assay was conducted in HL-60 by using another apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, USA). For this, HL-60 cells (5 × 105/well) were treated for 24 hr with compounds 1i, camptothecin and cis-platin (10 μM concentration each). Cells were processed and stained with Annexin V-FITC/PI according to the manufacturer’s instructions and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, USA) using Cell Quest software at two wavelengths 515 and 639 nm. Vehicle (DMSO) treated unstained and stained [annexin V-FITC/PI] cells were used as controls (Figure 4).",1

Blank cell lysate control was also included. Enzyme-catalyzed release of pNA was monitored using a microplate reader at 405 nm (Figure 5A and 5B).",1
7,10,"MOLT-4 cells were incubated with compound 1i (10 μM) in DMSO for different time periods. Control cells received DMSO only (< 0.5%). Treated and control cells were washed in PBS, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min. Pellets were divided into 1 mm 3 pieces and fixed immediately in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 hr at 4°C, post-fixed with 1% OsO4 in the same buffer for 2 hr, dehydrated with acetone, cleared in propylene oxide and embedded in Epon812 [14]. Semithin (1 μm) sections were cut, stained with toluidine blue and morphology of treated cells was observed [14] at different times under light microscope [Olympus, Japan]. Photomicrographs were taken with Olympus Digital Camera (C4000) (Figure 6). Ultrathin sections of silver color (60-90 nm) were cut on a LKB ultramicrotome IV, mounted on copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The sections were viewed and photographed in a JEOL-100CXII electron microscope at 60 kV (Figure 7).",1

Mitonafide at the same concentration was used for comparison.",1
7,12,Values were recorded as the mean ± S.E.M. (standard error mean) of three experiments. Experimental results were analyzed by Student’s t-test. P < 0.05 was considered as the level of significance for values obtained for treated groups compared with control group.,1
7,13,"In vitro screening of compounds 1a-j against U-937 and HL-60 revealed that compounds 1a-c, 1e-1h and 1j did not show appreciable activity as their IC50 values were above 10 μM. Compounds 1d and 1i having IC50 values in the range of 0.7 and 6.0 μM in U-937, HL-60 and MOLT-4 were found to be cytotoxic (Table 1). The IC50 values of compounds 1d and 1i were much less than that of doxorubicin, 5-FU, cis-platin, BCNU and hydroxyurea used as standards (Table 1) suggesting greater antitumor properties in compounds 1d and 1i. In view of this, compounds 1d and 1i were selected for further screening in a battery of human tumor cell lines. The results summarized in Table 2 revealed that compound 1d has elicited significant growth inhibition in two (IMR-32 and COLO-205) out of six cell lines used while compound 1i elicited significant growth inhibition in five (SK-N-SH; 502713, SW-620, DU-145 and PC-3) out of ten cell lines tested. It appears that compound 1i is the most active member.",1
7,14,Compounds 1d and 1i showed high IC50 values of 698 and 273 μM respectively against human PBMC in vitro suggesting that these compounds were devoid of significant cytotoxicity against normal cells.,1
7,15,"MOLT-4 cells exposed to 10.0 and 16.7 μM of compound 1i for 24 hr exhibited increase in sub-G1 fraction which may comprise of both apoptotic cells and cell debris implying up-regulation of cell death machinery. The effect was much more for the higher concentration of the compound. For instance, the sub-G1 fractions of control and camptothecin-treated cells were 0.68% and 11.92% respectively whereas the same were 4.69% and 21.02% for compound 1i at the low and high concentrations (Figure 2). This might indicate a dose dependant increase in apoptosis of MOLT-4 cells inflicted by compound 1i. The cell cycle analysis also showed accumulation of treated cells in S and G2/M phases. Increase in S phase fraction could be due to stimulation of DNA synthesis or delay in movement of cells from S to G2/M phase. Concomitant rise in G2 /M fraction indicates delay in exit of daughter cells from the mitotic cycle. Therefore the findings suggest delayed turnover of cells leading to reduction of tumor cell number.",1
7,16,MOLT-4 and HL-60 control and treated cells were stained with annexin V-FITC/PI and gated into LR (Lower Right) and UR (Upper Right) quadrants. Cells in LR and UR were considered as early apoptotic (annexin + /PI - ) and late apoptotic (annexin + /PI + ) respectively. Extent of apoptosis was expressed as the sum total of the percentages in LR and UR quadrants. Cells in LL (Lower Left) and UL (Upper Left) quadrants were considered live and necrotic respectively. Apoptosis induced by compound 1i was compared with that of camptothecin (Figure 3) and camptothecin and cis-platin used as standards (Figure 4). Apoptosis recorded in untreated control MOLT-4 and HL-60 cells were 3.61% and 2.54% respectively.,1
7,17,"In MOLT-4, total apoptosis exhibited by camptothecin at 5 mM concentration was 8.89%. In contrast compound 1i at 10.0 and 16.7 mM concentrations was effective in inducing 27.54% and 30.86% apoptosis respectively. The necrotic cell populations for compound 1i at these doses were 5.15% and 4.80% respectively (Figure 3).",1
7,18,"In HL-60, compound 1i induced 98.62% apoptosis at a dose of 10 μM (LR 3.49%, UR 95.13%). This is in contrast to 15.82% and 7.51% apoptosis respectively induced by camptothecin and cisplatin at the same dose. Thus compound 1i was more effective than standards in inducing apoptosis in HL-60 (Figure 4).",1
7,19,Treatment of MOLT-4 cells with compound 1i was associated with marked increase in caspase-3 as well as caspase-6 activities that confirm the apoptotic mode of cell death. Up-regulation of caspase-3 by compound 1i was maximum at 5.0 μM concentration at 12 hr posttreatment (Figure 5a) while caspase-6 activity was highest also at 5.0 μM concentration at 24 hr post-treatment (Figure 5b). Similar activations were produced by camptothecin at 5.0 μM concentration (Figure 5a-b).,1
7,20,"The morphology of MOLT-4 cells treated with compound 1i at 5 and 10 μM was monitored by light microscopy at different time points. The number of apoptotic cells increased with higher concentration of the compound and longer incubation period. Figure 6b represents the characteristic morphology of apoptotic cells following 36 hr of incubation at 10 μM concentration. Marginalization of chromatin material accompanied by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation/fragmentation and formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles, considered as hallmark of apoptosis, were clearly visible. Control cells showed large sized nuclei having nucleoli (Figure 6a).",1
7,21,"In transmission electron microscopy, MOLT-4 control cells (Figure 7a-b) exhibited a high nucleocytoplasmic ratio and the nucleus had a finely dispersed chromatin with nuclear pores. The nucleoli were clearly visible in most of the cells. The mitochondria with cristae (MC) in various size and shape (oval and elongated), rough endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes were seen. MOLT-4 cells treated with 10 μM of compound 1i for 36 h revealed damaged mitochondrial cristae and highly reduced rough endoplasmic reticulum suggesting apoptosis (Figure 7c-f). No inflammatory changes in nuclei and cytoplasm coupled with absence of breakage in plasma membrane ruled out the possibility of necrotic events. Vacuolization was also seen in treated cells. Literature survey also revealed similar observations [16,17].",1
7,22,"Since compound 1d and 1i have structural similarity with mitonafide, studies were conducted to ascertain whether drug-induced tumor growth inhibition was also due to the inhibitory effect of these compounds on nucleic acid synthesis. Accordingly 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine incorporation by S-180 cells collected from untreated tumor bearing mice was measured after treating the tumor cells in vitro. The untreated S-180 cells demonstrated an almost linear pattern of 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine incorporation over a period of 60 min. Exposure of tumor cells to test compounds at the concentration of 8 μM resulted in gradual and marked inhibition of 3 H-thymidine and 3 H-uridine incorporation comparable to that of mitonafide at the same concentration (8 μM). After 1 hr of incubation with compound 1d and 1i 3H-thymidine incorporation was declined by 96% and 95% respectively against 95% reduction by mitonafide exposure. Thus the compounds showed remarkable inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis. Inhibition of RNA synthesis, in contrast was less spectacular as inhibition of 3 H-uridine was 92%, 94% and 89% for mitonafide, compound 1d and 1i respectively (Figure 8).",1
7,23,"The nature and position of a substituent in a molecule are known to play important roles in deciding its antitumor property. The present study has shown that out of the five different substituents (R = H, 6-Br, 6-Cl, 6-NO2, 5-NO2) present in the aromatic ring portion of substituted N-(hydroxyalkyl)naphthalimide moiety, the 6-NO2 substituent is crucial in exercising the antitumor activity. This is in agreement with our earlier finding in other (chloroalkyl) naphthalimide compounds wherein we found 6-nitro-2-(3-chloropropyl) naphthalimide as the most active antitumor agent in that series [7].",1
7,24,"Compound 1i that showed most pronounced antitumor activity interfered with S and G2/M phases of cell cycle of MOLT-4 cells. As a preparatory step towards cell division, a cell duplicates its DNA in S phase of cell cycle. Thus, interference of S phase by compound 1i as observed in flow cytometric measurements, suggests that it affects DNA duplication process of tumor cell before mitosis. This possibility was confirmed in S-180 cells in which compound 1i inhibited 3 H-thymidine incorporation into DNA, implying suppression of DNA synthesis. Moreover, it inhibited 3H-uridine uptake, indicating concomitant inhibition of RNA synthesis. Taken together, the results suggest that inhibition of DNA and RNA might have played a role in mediating the antitumor effect of compound 1i.",1
7,25,"Delay in exit from G2/M, the final phase of cell cycle, was another flow cytometric observation in compound 1i treated MOLT-4 cells. A situation like this develops when there is defect in DNA damage repair, spindle attachment with centromeres and polymerization of spindle microtubules [18]. In view of these reports, it appears that the compound has adverse effect on the mitotic apparatus causing up-regulation of the spindle checkpoint control leading to delayed mitotic exit of daughter cells. It is known that vinca alkaloids [19] and paclitaxel [20] mediate their antitumor effects by interfering with spindle microtubules. Compound 1i may act in a similar fashion like them.",1
7,26,"Induction of apoptosis or programmed cell death is a common mechanistic pathway of several antitumor agents [21]. Compound 1i has exerted its antitumor action by this pathway as well. This is evident from sharp rise in sub-G1 fraction, light and electron microscopic studies showing morphological imprints of apoptosis and marked increase in caspase 3 and 6 in treated cells. Apoptosis is controlled by a diverse range of cell signals which may originate intracellularly via the mitochondria or extracellularly via death receptors on cell membranes. These two pathways of signals converge and form a common irreversible execution phase mediated by caspase 3 and 6. Whether the pro-apoptotic signal elicited by compound 1i followed the intrinsic (mitochondrial) or extrinsic (death receptor) pathway is not clearly understood. However, extensive damage of mitochondrial cristae in treated cells, as observed in ultrastructural study, favours mitochondrial pathway. Like the present finding, induction of apoptosis by many naphthalimides including amonafide and amonafide analogs has been reported [22,23].",1
7,27,"In essence, the present study demonstrated significant antitumor activity by compound 1i against murine S-180 tumor cells and a panel of human tumor cell lines in vitro and the effect was mediated by inhibition of cell proliferation and up-regulation of programmed cell death. Since the compound did not elicit any cytotoxicity against normal human PBMC, it holds promise for further development as a potential antitumor agent.",1
8,1,"Erlotinib, one of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), is active and relatively well tolerated in chemotherapy-naïve elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [1]. Image-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and helical tomotherapy (HT) using hypofractionation in patients with early-stage medically inoperable NSCLC is feasible and well tolerated [2]. For stage III NSCLC, hypofractionation yields equivalent survival rates, but without often fatal symptomatic pneumonitis, compared to conventional radiotherapy [3]. The addition of standard-dose erlotinib to chemoradiotherapy is feasible, without an increase in toxicity [4]. Little information is available on fatal pulmonary toxicity due to irradiation pneumonitis when erlotinib is concurrently given with SBRT and used thereafter as maintenance therapy for NSCLC.",1
8,2,"A 77-year-old man was diagnosed with NSCLC, cT2N2M0, stage III A. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed a soft tissue mass measuring 4 × 3.9 cm in the right upper lung, with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was also elevated to 12.9 mg/dl. The Patient received oral erlotinib 150 mg/day as the first line therapy. Three months later, the CEA increased from 12.9 ng/ml to 29.1 ng/ml. Then, erlotinib was added concurrently to the radiotherapy regimen. This regimen comprised 54 Gy given in nine fractions delivered with SBRT using HT, at 95% of the prescribed isodose for the planned target volume. The split courses with 3 fractions per week were prescribed. (Figure 1 and 2) Targeting was based on new, separate CT scans for each split course.",1
8,3,"The tumor volume (ml) vs. the right lung volume was 116.1 ml vs. 1282.9 ml in the first treatment course and 90.9 ml vs. 1475.9 ml in the second treatment course. The mean lung dose, V15, and V20, where Vx was the percentage of lung volume that received at least × Gy [5] for separate lung images, is shown Table 1. The whole-course V20 and mean lung dose for the total lung were 10% and 10.24 Gy, respectively. By 2.5 months after the combination therapy, the tumor shrank from 4 × 3.9 × 4.5 cm to 2.4 × 2.9 × 2.1 cm and erlotinib 150 mg/day was prescribed as maintenance therapy. Unfortunately, the patient developed dyspnea three months after the combination therapy. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit. In a series of image studies, opacities of a diffuse ground-glass pattern, subpleural bleb formation in the marginal areas, airspace consolidation and fibrosis in bilateral whole lung fields were noted, and radiation pneumonitis was suspected (Figure 3, 4, 5, 6) [6,7]. The patient received empirical antibiotics, steroid therapy, antioxidant, and supportive treatment. Four more months after the combined therapy, the patient died of respiratory failure.",1
8,4,"Image-guided SBRT with HT using hypofractionation in patients with early-stage medically inoperable NSCLC is feasible [2]. The hypofractionated scheme yields equivalent survival rates, without fatal, symptomatic pneumonitis for patients with stage III NSCLC when compared with conventional radiotherapy [3]. Belderbos et al. [8] reported that radiation dose escalation was safe up to 94.5 Gy in 42 fractions with a mean lung dose 13.6 Gy or less in 6 weeks in NSCLC patients. The patients underwent irradiation 5 days per week, and twice daily when more than 30 fractions were prescribed, with at least a 6-h interval in between each fraction. According to linear-quadratic (LQ) modeling [9], the biologic effect of 94.5 Gy/42 fractions converted to a hypofractional dose of 6 Gy per fraction (EQD6), for which the acute effects and late normal tissue effects would be equivalent to 72 and 54 Gy, respectively. The mean lung dose (≥ 21 Gy), V20 (> 31%) [10], and ipsilateral V20 Gy [5] correlates with radiation pneumonitis. Nonetheless, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0236 protocol using SBRT via HT for NSCLC provided safe and effective treatment when the V20 was restricted to less than 10% to 15% [11]. The V15, V20, and mean lung dose for each separate lung by divided course are shown in the Table.",1
8,5,"Erlotinib, an EGFR TKI, is an effective anti-tumor agent for treatment of NSCLC among elderly patients [1]. Erlotinib could be used as a single agent in select subsets of patients with advanced NSCLC [12]. In a comparative trial, only 0.8% of patients developed interstitial lung disease in the erlotinib arm [13]. Moreover, addition of standard-dose erlotinib to chemoradiotherapy was feasible and without evidence of increased toxicities [4]. However, prior tissue injury from radiation therapy could lead to cells with altered responses when the drug is subsequently applied [14]. Erlotinib enhanced radiation responses including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, accelerated cellular repopulation, and DNA damage repair [15]. Therefore, it is possible for erlotinib to induce an altered response in cells when erlotinib is applied after irradiation.",1
8,6,"Though SBRT applied by HT allows for minimization of normal tissue exposure to high radiation doses [16], the large amount of low-dose irradiation to non-target organs at risk (OAR), and thus, the incidence of lung toxicity can become high [17]. Recently, non-target OARs were impacted by arc therapy due to the low dose bath phenomenon and these effects could be magnified by agents known or unknown to be associated with recall effects [18]. Irradiation modulates the anticancer drug’s pharmacokinetics even under low doses and in off-target areas [19]. Additionally, combined low-dose radiation and erlotinib induced symptomatic pneumonitis in one NSCLC patient [20]. Another NSCLC patient developed radiation recall dermatitis induced by erlotinib [21]. According to these reports, we believe EGFR inhibitor might not only enhance the effects of radiation, but also might enhance the adverse effects of radiation, especially when prescribed following previous concurrent treatment with radition. Furthermore, radiation modulates the systemic efficts of drugs regardless of the treatment effects or side effects. Erlotinib appears to modulate the effects of irradiation, both good and bad.",1
8,7,"To our best knowledge, this is the first report of radiation pneumonitis caused by erlotinib combined with image-guided SBRT via HT with hypofractionation followed by erlotinib presecribed for maintenance. Oncologists should be alert to the potential risk of fatal pulmonary toxicity caused by this multimodality treatment. Radiotherapy plus targeting agents must be conducted in well-designed clinical trials.",1

9,1,"Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is a small, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus that causes classical swine fever (CSF), a highly contagious disease of swine and wild boars [1]. CSFV belongs to the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae. The genus also includes bovine viral diarrhea virus and border disease virus which are important livestock pathogens [2,3]. CSF viruses can be divided into three major groups with ten subgroups by genetic typing [4]. Recent phylogenetic analyses indicated that there has been a switch in the virus population from the historical group 1 or 3 to the recent group 2 in many European and Asian countries [4-9]. Noteworthy, all live-attenuated vaccine strains used in different countries belong to group 1 [4], including the subgroup 1.1 Chinese lapinized vaccine strain (C-strain) which was derived by serial passage of a virulent strain in rabbits. The C-strain has been used for prophylactic vaccination in China since 1954. Two independent studies also reported that subgroup 2.1 strains recently branched away from the vaccine C-strain and became dominant in China [10,11].",1
9,2,"E2 is the major envelope glycoprotein exposed on the surface of the virion. It is essential for virus attachment and entry into the host cells as well as cell tropism [12,13]. This glycoprotein has been implicated as one of the virulence determinants [14,15]. In addition, it can induce neutralizing antibodies and confer protective immunity in pigs [16-21]. The antigenic structure of E2 has been identified using a number of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Two independent antigenic units, B/C and A/D (residues 690-800 and 766-865, respectively) have been identified in the N-terminal half of E2 [22,23]. In this context, deletion of the C-terminal half did not affect antibody binding [22-24], and the first six conserved cysteine residues as well as the antigenic motif 771LLFD774 are important for the antigenic structure of E2 [22,25].",1
9,3,"Genetic diversity of E2 among different groups has been extensively studied [4,10,26-29]. The N-terminal half of E2 is more variable than the C-terminal half [10], suggesting that the antigenic units could be under positive selection apparently due to constant exposure to high immunologic pressure. Different patterns of reactivity with mAbs provided clues of antigenic variation of E2 among different CSFV isolates [11,25,30-33]. A study using neutralizing mAbs to select mAb-resistant mutants showed that, in most cases, single point mutations could lead to complete loss of mAbs binding [22]. Furthermore, amino acid (aa) substitutions at position 710 on the E2 proteins of different strains affected binding and neutralization by a panel of mAbs [34]. Single amino acid exchanges between a group 1 vaccine strain LPC and a group 3 field isolate could totally reverse the mAbs binding pattern [35]. Taken together, variability by one or more amino acids within antigenic units may result in the antigenic variation of E2. To our knowledge, all studies that attempted to resolve antigenic variation of glycoprotein E2 utilized mouse mAbs [11,25,30-35]. No attempt has been made to probe the antigenic variation or group-specific antigenic determinants using anti-CSFV sera from pig, the natural host of CSFV.",1
9,4,"In this study, we raised pig antisera against CSFV vaccine C-strain and a representative subgroup 2.1 strain QZ-07 to assess the extent of antigenic variation within antigenic units of glycoprotein E2. Rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant E2 (rE2) protein from C-strain to evaluate if antigenic variation of E2 results in differences in cross-neutralization. A series of variant C-strain rE2 proteins with single substitutions based on amino acid differences between the C-strain and group 2 isolates were used to define residues involved in antigenic variation of E2.",1
9,5,"The use of prokaryotic-derived truncated rE2 proteins has been applied in antigen production, antigenic domain identification and epitope mapping [24,36-40]. In this study, two types of truncated rE2 proteins were expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells (Figure 1A and Table 1). One protein, rE2-BC (aa 690-814), covered the N-terminal 123 residues which are considered to constitute the minimal antigenic domain required for binding to pig anti-CSFV serum [24]. The other protein, rE2-AD (aa 690-865), contained both antigenic units B/C and A/D [22,23]. Western blotting indicated that rE2-BC and rE2-AD proteins of the vaccine C-strain had the molecular weights of 20 and 25 kDa, respectively, and reacted strongly with pig anti-C-strain hyperimmune serum (Figure 1B). Therefore, the prokaryotic-derived rE2 proteins were suitable for use as immunogens to generate polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies as well as for the antibody binding assessments.",1
9,6,"To assess the antigenic variation of E2 between the subgroup 1.1 C-strain and subgroup 2.1 field isolates, the respective rE2-AD proteins were cross-examined by ELISA with antisera collected from pigs at different time points after immunization with the vaccine C-strain or infection with strain QZ-07 (representing subgroup 2.1). Figure 2 shows that each antiserum reacted much more strongly with rE2-AD protein of the homologous strain (used to prepare the serum) than that of the heterologous strain. Figure 3 further compares binding efficiency of anti-C-strain and anti-QZ-07 sera (collected at 78 days post immunization with the C-strain and 25 days post infection with strain QZ-07, respectively) to rE2AD proteins derived from C-strain and 8 subgroup 2.1 strains. The homologous binding efficiency was set at 100%. The anti-C-strain serum exhibited significantly low efficiency of binding to subgroup 2.1 rE2-AD proteins (below 60% efficiency). Binding of anti-Q7-07 serum to the C-strain rE2-AD protein was even more inefficient (below 20% efficiency), and the band was barely visible on the blot. Binding of anti-QZ-07 serum to heterologous subgroup 2.1 proteins was varied.",1
9,7,"A two-way neutralization analysis using the pig antiCSFV sera revealed that heterologous neutralization was less effective, especially with sera collected at the early days following vaccination or infection (Figure 4). Interestingly, neutralization efficiency also differed between subgroup 2.1 strains QZ-07 and HZ1-08. Since strain variation influences the ability of antisera to neutralize heterologous viruses, and inefficient binding of antisera to heterologous rE2-AD proteins was also observed (Figure 3), we sought to determine whether variation of glycoprotein E2 affects CSFV cross-neutralization. Thus, we raised a rabbit antiserum (polyclonal antibodies) and three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against C-strain rE2-AD protein. The rabbit antiserum neutralized the QZ-07 virus less efficiently (log10 1.8) than the C-strain (log10 2.1). Furthermore, substitution of cysteine residues in the antigenic unit B/C with serine residues abolished the reactivity of mAbs 1E7 and 6B8 to E2. However, such mutagenesis did not affect the reactivity of mAb 2B6 (Table 2). These results indicate that these cysteine residues are involved in the structural conformation of E2 [22,23] and that mAbs 1E7 and 6B8 bind to conformational epitopes. In addition, mAb 2B6 only bound to C-strain although its neutralization efficiency was low.",1
9,8,"To determine the amino acid residues responsible for the observed antigenic variation, E2 sequences of 108 CSFV strains representative of each group were obtained from GenBank and aligned. Twenty major variable residues were identified within the antigenic units. Table 3 shows the variability of these residues between vaccine strains and representative group 2 strains.",1
9,9,"We used site-directed mutagenesis to systematically substitute amino acids in C-strain E2 protein with those found at the same positions in subgroup 2.1 proteins (Table 3 - 2nd last row). The binding of the wild type and variant C-strain rE2 proteins to C-strain and strain QZ-07 antisera was determined by binding ELISA. Wells of plates were coated with equal quantities of proteins and the antibodies were above saturation levels to ensure that antibody concentration was not limiting. The binding of the wt C-strain rE2 protein to either of the sera was set at 100%. None of the substitutions changed the binding of the variant rE2 proteins to antiC-strain serum significantly (binding efficiency was between 80%-130%), suggesting that these residues did not contribute individually to the overall capacity of Cstrain rE2 protein to bind the antibodies (Figure 5A). However, thirteen substitutions increased binding of the variant C-strain rE2 proteins to anti-QZ-07 serum (i.e., above 150% binding efficiency threshold). Substitution of D705N, L709P, G713E, N723S, or S779A caused a significant increase in binding efficiency (i.e., above 200% threshold), while a moderate increase was observed with D725G, N729D, N777S, T780I, D847E, M854V, T860I, or N863K substitution (between 150% and 200% efficiency).",1
9,10,"The residues that caused significant or moderate increase of binding efficiency formed three distinct clusters in the antigenic units (Figure 1A). The first cluster is located in the N-terminus of antigenic unit B/C at the amino acid positions 702-731. The second cluster is at the boundary between the two antigenic units at positions 774-799 and the third one is in the C-terminus of antigenic unit A/D at positions 841-864. Interestingly, hydrophilicity analysis further demonstrated that these regions contribute to major hydrophilic differences between CSFV C-strain and strain QZ-07 (Figure 5C).",1
9,11,"To get more insight into antigenic and genetic evolution of the antigenic units, the diversity of codon and amino acid was analyzed by a variant Simpson’s index [41]. Figure 6 shows that the thirteen residues associated with antigenic variation (Figure 5 and Table 3) lie along the diagonal (x = y), indicating that these residues are highly diversified due to accumulation of large numbers of nonsynonymous mutations in their codons. In contrast, the six cysteine residues and residues in the 771LLFD774 motif [25] lie along the x axis due to high conservation even though their codons have accumulated a moderate number of synonymous mutations. However, the antigenic residues identified by mAb-resistant mutants analysis [22] were mapped as having random distribution (Figure 6).",1
9,12,"Phylogenetically, CSFV consists of three major groups [4]. Recent studies revealed that viral populations have shifted from the historical group 1 or 3 to group 2 in most European and Asian countries [4-10]. Glycoprotein E2 is a principal target of neutralizing antibodies and an important protective immunogen [16-21]. The E2 glycoproteins of three groups are genetically and antigenically different [4,10,11,25-35]. However, the basis of this antigenic variation has not been clearly demonstrated at the molecular level.",1
9,13,"Our data show that both pig anti-C-strain and anti-QZ07 sera bound heterologous rE2-AD proteins (from CSFV strain QZ-07 and C-strain, respectively) with <60% efficiency compared to homologous proteins (Figure 3A), indicating that these proteins are antigenically different. Further, the E2 protein of vaccine C-strain is antigenically distinct from those of a wide spectrum of subgroup 2.1 strains. Antigenic variation was also detected among subgroup 2.1 strains as indicated by the inefficiency of pig anti-QZ-07 serum to bind HZ1-08- and QZ2-06-derived rE2-AD proteins (Figure 3). Our data further demonstrate that the previously reported differences in antigenicity detected by mouse mAbs [11,25,30-35] also occur in the context of pig anti-CSFV sera.",1
9,14,"We performed neutralization experiments to assess whether the differences in the efficiency of antibody binding to rE2 proteins (Figure 3) correlate with the ability of the antibody to block CSFV infection. A two-way neutralization determination showed that pig anti-CSFV sera neutralized heterologous strains less efficiently (Figure 4). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against purified C-strain rE2-AD protein also showed less efficiency at neutralizing strain QZ-07. Furthermore, two conformational anti-C-strain-rE2-AD mAbs (1E7 and 6B8) had lower binding and neutralization efficiency against the heterologous strains compared to C-strain (Table 2), suggesting that the neutralization differences seen with pig anti-CSFV sera were, at least in part, due to differential expression of antigenic epitopes on the E2 glycoproteins of CSFV strains. Such antigenic variation may explain why subgroup 2.1 CSFV strains persist in China despite the wide use of vaccine C-strain. Antibody selection may be one of the reasons for the switch of viral populations from group 1 to 2.",1
9,15,"We used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce amino acid substitutions in the C-strain rE2 proteins in order to probe whether variable residues (Table 3) contribute to the antigenic variation seen with subgroup 2.1 strains. Unlike the mutations in the antigenic motif 771LLFD774 that disrupted the structural integrity of E2 protein [25], none of the substitutions had a significant effect on binding to anti-C-strain serum (Figure 5A). We infer that the recombinant proteins were not grossly misfolded and the substituted residues may not be critical for the overall structural stability of glycoprotein E2. In contrast, of the 20 substitutions, 13 enhanced binding of the variant C-strain rE2 proteins to anti-QZ-07 serum (Figure 5A). The most dramatic increase in binding was caused by the GtoE substitution at aa position 713 (Figure 5A and 5B). Sequence alignment revealed that all group 2 strains have residue 713E, while all the vaccine strains have 713G (Table 3). Chang et al. recently reported that residues 713 E and 729 D were critical for specificity of a group 3.4 field strain rE2 protein to mAbs [35]. It appears that 713E is a common antigenic determinant for both groups 2 and 3.",1
9,16,"Our work demonstrates that although residue 729D enhanced binding to pig anti-QZ-07 serum, residues 705N, 709P, 723S, and 779A had much more significant contribution (Figure 5A). Notably, the same residues are found at positions 705 and 723 on E2 proteins of subgroup 2.1 and subgroup 3.4 strains. It is possible that these two residues may also show superior contribution to the antigenicity of subgroup 3.4 glycoprotein E2 if probed with pig antisera against group 3 strains. In this study, we used polyclonal sera from pigs C-strain-immunized or infected with a field strain which contained the full spectrum of immunization- or infection-induced antibodies. This is why these polyclonal sera could identify more residues responsible for antigenic variation of glycoprotein E2 than mouse mAbs [35]. Furthermore, pairing of the polyclonal antisera against the group 1 C-strain and representative group 2 field strain could probe the residues that mediate antigenic variation between the two groups, another advantage over mAbs.",1
9,17,"Based on the data revealed by the site-directed mutagenesis analysis (Figure 5A), the antigenic variation among subgroup 2.1 strains is not unexpected since each of the 8 subgroup 2.1 strains used in this study has some unique strain-specific substitutions (data not shown). The C737R substitution in the antigenic units of strain QZ2-06 appears to affect binding the most. This can be explained by the fact that the cysteine residue at this position is critical for the antigenic structure of the protein [22]. We speculate that E782V substitution in strain HZ1-08 is the key determinant of antigenic variation between strain HZ1-08 and our reference subgroup 2.1 strain QZ-07.",1
9,18,"Three discrete antigenic regions were mapped at aa positions 702-731, 774-799 and 841-864, in the antigenic units of E2 protein (Figure 1A). Several antigenic residues identified by mAb-resistant mutants analysis [22] or epitope mapping [35] and substitutions with significant increase in binding of variant rE2 proteins to anti-QZ-07 serum examined in this study are clustered in the 702-731 region (Figure 5A), implying that evolution of this region is the primary cause of antigenic variation of glycoprotein E2. The N-terminus of antigenic region 774-799 contains the conserved antigenic motif 771LLFD774 [25] and a conserved linear 772LFDGTNP778 epitope [39], suggesting its essential role in maintaining the integrity of antigenic structure of E2 protein. In addition, the substitutions of N777S, S779A, and T780I in this region enhanced binding of variant rE2 proteins to anti-QZ-07 serum (Figure 5A). Therefore, region 774-799 may have multiple functions in shaping the antigenicity of E2.",1
9,19,"Finally, we analyzed E2 sequences of CSFV in order to compare codon and amino acid diversification in relation to antigenic evolution. We employed a variant Simpson’s index that has been used to quantify codon and amino acid diversity in the antigenic epitopes of influenza virus hemagglutinin glycoprotein [41,42]. The diversity of each of the thirteen amino acid residues involved in antigenic variation is equivalent to that of the corresponding codon (Figure 6: the unique distribution along the x = y diagonal), indicating a remarkable correlation between genetic and antigenic evolution within the antigenic units of glycoprotein E2 in nature. In contrast, the antigenic residues identified by mAbresistant mutants analysis [22] are randomly diversified (Figure 6: randomly distributed grey-colored residues), suggesting that in vitro selection may not explain natural selection in pig. Co-diversification of codons and amino acids involved in antigenic variation in the field strains could be one of the immune evasion mechanisms that CSFV employs under immune pressure as a result of extensive vaccination [43].",1
9,20,"This study demonstrates antigenic variation of CSFV glycoprotein E2 between the vaccine C-strain and group 2 field strains or even within group 2 strains currently circulating in China. Of the three discrete regions associated with antigenic variation, substitutions in the first region (aa 702-731) are the primary determinants of the antigenic variation of E2. Since glycoprotein E2 variation affects CSFV cross-neutralization, subsequent work will determine whether these antigenic residues contribute to the observed neutralization differences. Our findings may provide useful information for the development of differential serological assays and novel CSF vaccines with improved immunogenicity and efficacy.",1
9,21,"Swine testicle (ST) cells were grown in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The following CSFV strains were used: the subgroup 1.1 vaccine C-strain widely used for prophylactic vaccination in China and two subgroup 2.1 strains recently circulating in China (strains QZ-07 and HZ1-08). CSFV vaccine C-strain was obtained from Zhejiang Jianliang Biological Engineering Company (Zhejiang province, China). Two subgroup 2.1 strains were originally isolated from spleens of naturally infected pigs and replicated in ST cells in our laboratory. These three viruses were propagated and titrated in ST cells. Stocks were aliquoted and stored at -80°C until use. The virus stocks were sequenced to confirm that the E2 genes had the expected sequences. The other 6 subgroup 2.1 strains were not isolated and only their E2 genes were directly cloned in plasmids. Sequence data is available in GenBank as listed in Table 3. Details of their molecular phylogenetic relationships have been described elsewhere [10,26].",1
9,22,"All E2 sequences covering the complete antigenic region were retrieved from NCBI database. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences were aligned using Clustal X software (version 1.83). Sequences with 100% nucleotide identity were excluded. The remaining sequences included 23, 82 and 3 sequences representing groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. This dataset was used to identify the major variable residues (see Table 3) and to analyze the codon and amino acid diversity (Figure 6).",1
9,23,"The plasmids containing full-length E2 gene of the vaccine C-strain and eight subgroup 2.1 strains used in this study were previously described [10,26]. The C-strain specific primer sets C-E2-AD-f/C-E2-AD-r and C-E2BC-f/C-E2-BC-r were used to amplify the fragment covering the two antigenic units (B/C+A/D) and the fragment only containing antigenic unit B/C, respectively. Primer set QZ-E2-AD-f/QZ-E2-AD-r was used to amplify the fragments covering the two antigenic units of group 2 isolates (Table 1). PCR amplicons were digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI, gel purified and ligated into prokaryotic expression vector pET-30a(+). To construct the eukaryotic expression plasmid, a 1212-bp cDNA fragment encoding the signal sequence and full-length E2 of C-strain was amplified with primer set C-E2-f and C-E2-r (Table 1), and cloned into pcDNA3.1 following BamHI and XhoI digestion.",1
9,24,"E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells containing different recombinant plasmids were cultured to an optical density (OD) between 0.6 and 0.8 at 600 nm. Expression of His-tagged rE2 proteins was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG, Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation, the inclusion bodies with rE2 proteins were resuspended with 1/10 volume of buffer (100 mM NaH2PO4·2H2O, 10 mM Tris-base, and 8 M Urea). The supernatant was collected after centrifugation and purified by Ni-NTA affinity column (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Finally, the proteins were refolded by washing the column with 40 ml of Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4) containing 1 M urea and eluted from the column with 200 mM imidazole in TBS. The purified rE2 proteins were confirmed by Western blotting with mouse monoclonal anti-His-tag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and quantified by the Bradford assay.",1
9,25,"The pig hyperimmune serum against CSFV vaccine Cstrain was previously prepared and stocked in our laboratory. The pig antiserum to the C-strain (pig antiC-strain) or to the strain QZ-07 (pig anti-QZ-07) was induced by intramuscular immunization of 30-day-old CSFV-free pigs with the attenuated vaccine C-strain by prime-boost strategy or infection with 10 5 TCID50 of strain QZ-07 in a biosafety level III facility, respectively. The sera were collected at different times post-vaccination or infection and stored at -80°C until use. The sera at highest titers collected at 78 days post immunization with the C-strain and 25 days post infection with strain QZ-07 (see Figure 2) were used for binding ELISAs in Figure 3A and Figure 5A and Western blots in Figure 3B and Figure 5B.",1
9,26,The rabbit antiserum to the rE2-AD protein of C-strain was generated as follows: New Zealand white rabbits were immunized and boosted two times with 0.5 mg of the purified rE2-AD protein of C-strain (expressed in E. coli) emulsified with an equal volume of complete/incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich). Blood was drawn for antiserum preparation once maximum level of antibody production was reached.,1
9,27,"For monoclonal antibodies against the rE2-AD protein of C-strain, four 5-week-old female specific-pathogenfree BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously with 0.1 mg of the purified rE2-AD protein of vaccine C-strain emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant. The mice were intraperitoneally boosted twice with rE2-AD protein emulsified in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant at 2-week intervals. The mice were euthanized 2 weeks after the last boosting and spleen cells were harvested. Splenocytes were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells using 50% (v/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG, Sigma-Aldrich). The resulting hybridomas secreting antibodies against rE2AD protein were selected by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and then clonally expanded. Antibody subtyping was performed using mouse mAb Isotyping Reagents (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ascites were produced in pristine-primed BALB/c mice. Experiments with animals were approved by the Laboratory Animal Management Committee (animal welfare ethics is part of its duties) of Zhejiang University.",1
9,28,"To identify the antigenic units recognized by mAbs, cysteine codons of the C-strain E2 gene in eukaryotic expression plasmid were mutated to serine codons by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously [22].",1
9,29,"Multiple E2 sequence alignment was used to identify variable residues. Twenty major variable residues were identified in the antigenic units (Table 3). These do not include KtoR or StoT substitutions (K720R, K734R, K761R, S797T, and R845K substitutions). To substitute C-strain residues for those found in group 2 isolates, plasmids encoding individual mutations (listed in Table 3) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Substitutions were made on plasmids encoding the antigenic unit B/C or two units (B/C+A/D) of C-strain E2 protein depending on where the residue being substituted is located in the antigenic units.",1
9,30,"All substitutions were performed using QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers were designed via the QuikChange Primer Design Program http://www.stratagene.com. The desired nucleotide changes in each mutant were verified by sequencing. Expression and purification of variant rE2 proteins was done as mentioned above.",1
9,31,"All ELISAs described in this study were performed in triplicate under stringent conditions to avoid nonspecific reactions. Antibodies were diluted using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat dry milk (PBS/NFDM); each washing step included 5 washes with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween). Briefly, a 100-μl volume of different rE2 proteins (10 μg/ml in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) was added into each well of 96-well microtiter plates (MaxiSorp, Nunc, Denmark) for overnight incubation at 4°C. The wells were washed with PBS/Tween and then blocked with PBS/NFDM at 37°C for 2 h. The wells were washed and incubated with different antibodies for 1 h. The wells were washed again and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated SPA at 37°C for 1 h. Thereafter, wells were washed and incubated with 100 μl/well of the chromogenic substrate 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 4 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 2 M H2SO4 . Finally, the OD450nm was measured using spectraMax @M2 microplate reader (Molecular devices Corp., USA).",1
9,32,"The binding efficiency of rE2-AD proteins from Cstrain and 8 subgroup 2.1 strains with the two pig antisera to the C-strain and strain QZ-07 (Figure 3A) was normalized to anti-His-tag binding first, and then expressed as the ratio of antibody bound to individual group 2 rE2-AD protein to that bound to the rE2-AD proteins of C-strain or strain QZ-07, which was set at 100%. The mean binding efficiency of each individual protein was calculated for three independent ELISA assays.",1
9,33,"For variant C-strain rE2 proteins in Figure 5A, rE2-BC proteins were used for A692S, D705N, E706K, L709P, G713E, N723S, D725G, N729D, S736I, V738T, T745I, N777S, S779A, T780I, R788G, and S789F substitutions because these residues are located in the antigenic unit B/C. rE2-AD proteins were used for D847E, M854V, T860I, and N863K substitutions since these residues are located in the antigenic unit A/D. The results were first normalized to anti-His-tag binding and then expressed as the ratio of their binding to the antibodies to that of binding to C-strain wild type rE2-BC or rE2-AD binding to the reference serum depending on the kind of variant protein being compared. Relative binding of greater than 200% efficiency were designated as significant increases in antibody binding. Binding efficiencies between 150% and 200% efficiency were considered as moderate increases whereas those between 50% and 150% efficiency were considered as limited effect on antibody binding.",1
9,34,"The antigenic reactivity of different rE2 proteins was assessed by Western blotting. The proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (PALL Corp., USA). The membranes were subsequently blocked (overnight at 4°C) in blocking buffer (PBS/NFDM) and then incubated at 37°C for 1 h with different antibodies. After incubation, membranes were rinsed for 20 min in PBS/Tween, and bound antibodies were detected with SPA-conjugated with horseradish peroxidase diluted at 1:2500. For color development, 4-chloro-1-naphthol (4-CN, SigmaAldrich) was used.",1
9,35,"The neutralization indices (NI) of the antibodies against different CSFV strains were determined by virus neutralization assay. Briefly, ST cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. Two-fold serial dilutions of the different heat-inactivated sera were mixed with equal volumes of 100 TCID 50 virus suspensions, incubated at 37°C for 1 h and subsequently transferred to confluent monolayers of ST cells in 96-well plates. The starting dilution of each serum was 1:50. At 72 hours post-infection, the cells were fixed and stained for the presence of glycoprotein E2 by immunofluorescence assay. The NI is the log10 of the antibody dilution factor (reciprocal of dilution) when 50% of the wells are protected from infection. Since the starting dilution factor was 50, the NI value of 1.7 is the detection threshold of our neutralization assay.",1
9,36,"Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was used to verify the reactivity of the CSFV strains or cysteine-mutated E2 proteins with different antibodies. Briefly, cells infected with CSFV strains at 72 h or cells transfected with cysteine-mutated recombinant plasmids at 48 h were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 60 min and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were incubated for 1 h with different antibodies, and then stained with goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Texas green or goat antimouse antibody conjugated with Alexa red (Molecular Probes Inc., USA) for another 1 h. Cells were examined under the IX71 inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan).",1
9,37,"Hydrophobicity profile was generated using DNASIS software by the method of Kyte and Doolittle [44]. Evolution analysis was performed using an information-theoretic method described by Plotkin and Dushoff [41]. Briefly, we plotted the diversity of codons found at each residue against the diversity of amino acids found at the same residue. The diversity of codons or amino acids was quantified by a variant Simpson’s index: D = 1-pi2, where pi denotes the relative frequency of the i-th codon or amino acid at the residue in the multiple sequence alignment.",1
10,1,"Breast cancer is known to have both a genetic and nongenetic etiology. Several common genetic susceptibility variants have recently been identified, predominantly by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at loci containing the genes FGFR2, LSP1, MAP3K1, TOX3, MRPS30, COX 11, SLC4A7, and at chromosomes 8p24 and 2q35 [1-5]. To date, the only SNP associated with breast cancer risk with genome-wide statistical significance (P < 10 -7 ) coming from candidate gene approaches is CASP8 [6]; more equivocal evidence has been reported for SNPs in TGFB1 [6] and ESR1 [7], among others.",1
10,2,"It is important to determine how these common SNPs combine with other known risk factors such as age at menarche, parity, age at first birth and body mass index (BMI) [8,9] to influence breast cancer risk because this knowledge could be used to improve risk prediction models [10,11]. The identification of modification of SNP associations by other risk factors could also provide insight into the biological mechanisms by which genetic variants are implicated in breast cancer etiology. Many of these SNPs and other risk factors have been observed to be differentially associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative disease [1,4,5,7,12,13] and so interactions between them may also differ by disease subtype.",1
10,3,"We, therefore, aimed to assess effect modification for 12 SNPs, 10 of which have been clearly associated with breast cancer risk (10q26-rs298158 (FGFR2), 8q24rs13281615, 11p15-rs3817198 (LSP1), 5q11-rs889312 (MAP3K1), 16q12-rs2803662 (TOX3), 2q35-rs13387042, 5p12-rs10941679, 17q23-rs6504950, 3p24-rs4973768 and CASP8-rs17468277) and two for which there is less clear evidence of a main effect (TGFB1-rs1982073 and ESR1-rs3020314). The potential effect modifiers considered were age at menarche, ever having had a live birth, number of live births, age at first birth and BMI. A secondary aim was to evaluate these interactions in susceptibility to breast cancer subtypes defined by ER and progesterone receptor (PR) status. Data for white women of European ancestry were combined from 21 case-control studies participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC).",1
10,4,"A description of the 21 case-control studies participating in this pooled BCAC analysis is provided in Table 1, with more detailed information given in Additional Data Table S1 in Additional file 1. These included 11 population-based studies and seven studies with at least 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls. All studies collected selfreported information for cases and controls on age at diagnosis (cases) or interview (controls), racial/ethnic group (white European, Asian or other) and at least one of the following: age at menarche, ever having had a live birth, number of live births, age at first live birth (if parous), BMI (or height and weight). The time-point at which these variables were assessed for each study is detailed in Additional Data Table S1 in Additional file 1. Additional risk and other lifestyle factor information were not available at the time of the present analysis. All studies used structured questionnaires to collect these data, with the exception of the CNIO-BCS and the LMBC study, for which the information was abstracted from medical records. Nineteen studies also provided information on the ER and PR status of the tumors for a subset of cases. This information was mostly abstracted from medical records.",1
10,5,"Genotyping methods have been previously described [1,6,7,12,14]. Briefly, five studies (ABCFS, GENICA, kConFab/AOCS, MARIE and SASBAC) used Sequenom’s MassARRAY system and iPLEX technology (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA) for most SNPs. All other genotyping was done using Taqman® Assays-byDesignSM (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). SNP CASP8- rs17468277 is in complete linkage disequilibrium with CASP8-rs1045485, which has previously been reported to be associated with breast cancer [6]. All studies included at least one blank well (containing no DNA) per 384-well assay plate, at least 2% of samples in duplicate, and a common set of 93 samples from the Centre d’Etude Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) used by the HapMap Consortium (HAPMAPPT01, Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ, USA). Genotyping call rates and duplicate concordance rates were calculated after excluding samples that had previously repeatedly failed; all were greater than 95%. Concordance with CEPH genotypes was greater than 98%.",1
10,6,"Overall genetic associations were evaluated for each of the 12 SNPs by estimating odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) via logistic regression, assuming multiplicative per-allele effects for the risk allele, as first reported in the literature (see Table 2). Main effects of risk factors were assessed only in the 11 population-based studies using logistic regression, adjusted for age (categorical: ≤34, 35 to 39, 40 to 44, 45 to 49, 50 to 54, 55 to 59, 60 to 64, 65 to 69, 70 to 74, ≥75 years; and continuous, the latter to account for differences between cases and controls in the extreme agegroups) and study (categorical). Risk factors considered were age at menarche (categorical: ≤11, 12, 13, 14, ≥15 years; and continuous), ever having had a live birth (no, yes), number of live births (parous women only, categorical: 1, 2, 3, ≥4; and continuous), age at first birth (parous women only, categorical: ≤19, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, ≥30 years; and continuous) and BMI, defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (categorical: ≤24.99, 25.00 to 29.99, ≥30.00; and continuous).",1
10,7,"Since BMI is known to be positively associated with breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women, but inversely associated with risk in premenopausal women [9], we analyzed the interactions with BMI separately for women aged <55 years and ≥55 years, considering these as a surrogates for pre- and post-menopausal status, respectively. Results from analyses using a younger age limit (50 years) to determine surrogate categories for premenopausal status were similar and are therefore not presented. Estimates of per-allele ORs for SNPs stratified by risk factors (for the categories defined above) were obtained using a single logistic regression model including appropriate dummy variables, in addition to those for the main effects of the risk factor categories.",1
10,8,"Interaction, or modification of genetic associations by other risk factors, was assessed for each SNP/risk factor combination by fitting logistic regression models. Each model included dummy variables for study plus three parameters, one for the main per-risk-allele effect, one for the main risk factor effect (all modeled as continuous variables, except ever having had a live birth) and a single interaction term for the product of the number of risk alleles and the value of the risk factor. This was tested statistically by a likelihood ratio test comparing this model to that without the interaction term. Effect modification by BMI was assessed separately for women <55 and ≥55 years of age.",1
10,9,"In addition, a parametric bootstrap test was used to estimate interaction P-values adjusted for multiple testing [15]. For each of the 72 interactions tested, we estimated the probability of being a case for each subject under the null hypothesis of no interaction, by applying the logistic regression model including only main effects for study (categorical), SNP (per-allele) and risk factor (continuous, except ever having had a live birth). Each replicate of the parametric bootstrap consisted of, for each interaction tested: (i) generating a dummy casecontrol status for each subject by sampling from a binomial distribution based on the estimated probability of being a case (by generating a single random number from the uniform distribution and assigning “case” to subjects for which this was less than the probability of being a case and “control” otherwise); and (ii) based on this dummy case-control status and the actual data for all other variables, fitting the interaction model described above and noting the likelihood ratio test P-value for the comparison of this model to the main effects only model applied to the same data. The minimum P-value was recorded for each of 10,000 replicates and the adjusted P-values were estimated as the proportion of replication P-values less than the corresponding unadjusted P-value.",1
10,10,"All statistical analyses were carried out using Stata: Release 10 (Statacorp, College Station, TX, USA) [16] with the exception of power calculations which were done using Quanto (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA) [17,18].",1
10,11,"The 21 participating studies contributed 26,349 cases and 32,208 controls of self-reported white European race/ethnicity, all with available data for at least one of the 12 SNPs considered and at least one of the other risk factors considered (minimal data). Of these, 17,603 cases from 18 studies (all except BBCS, MCCS and USRT) were interviewed within two years after their breast cancer diagnosis and 29,187 controls came from the same 18 studies. Forty-six percent of cases and 38% of controls were under age 55 years at diagnosis and interview, respectively. ER and PR status was known for 19,561 and 16,962 cases, respectively. Details by study are provided in Table 1. In total, 12,822 cases and 19,703 controls with minimal data were included from 11 population-based studies and 16,107 cases and 23,140 controls with minimal data were included from seven studies with at least 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls.",1
10,12,"When analyses were restricted to population-based studies, the expected associations with breast cancer were observed for the risk factors, with one exception. After adjustment for age and study, each one-year increase in age at menarche was associated with a 4% (95% CI = 2 to 5%) decrease in breast cancer risk, and being parous was associated with a 16% (95% CI = 10 to 22%) decreased risk. For parous women, each additional live birth was associated with an 11% (95% CI = 8 to 13%) decrease in risk, while each five-year increment in age at first birth was associated with a 7% (95% CI = 4 to 10%) increase in risk. Obesity (BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m^2 ) was associated with a 20% (95% CI = 10 to 29%) lower risk of breast cancer for women under age 55 years. The one unexpected observation was that obesity was not associated with breast cancer risk in women aged 55 years and older (OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.04).",1
10,13,"Table 2 provides estimated per-allele ORs and their 95% CIs for the 12 SNPs considered, for all included subjects with genotype data, and for the subsets of women with information available for each of the four risk factors considered. All ORs were adjusted for study, and each subset was adjusted for study, age and the relevant risk factor. The OR estimates in the overall and subset analyses were very similar, and provide no evidence of confounding by the risk factors, nor of bias in OR estimates related to data availability.",1
10,14,"For the vast majority of SNP/risk factor combinations, there was no evidence that the per-allele OR for the SNP varied by category of the risk factor. This was true for analyses based on data from all studies (Additional Data Table S2 in Additional file 1), for analyses based on population-based studies only (Additional Data Table S3 in Additional file 1) and for analyses based on the seven studies with at least 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls (Additional Data Table S4 in Additional file 1). Restricting analyses to the 18 studies with cases interviewed within two years after their breast cancer diagnosis made no substantial difference to the results obtained (data not shown). Similarly null results were observed for analyses restricted to ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer (Additional Data tables S5 and S6 in Additional file 1) and for analyses restricted to PR-positive and PR-negative breast cancer (Additional Data Table S7 and S8 in Additional file 1).",1
10,15,"The strongest evidence of interaction (unadjusted P = 0.002) was for the modification of the association with 11p15-rs3817198 (LSP1) by number of live births. Per-allele OR estimates increased from 1.04 (95% CI = 0.97 to 1.11) for women who had had just one live birth to 1.24 (95% CI = 1.11 to 1.38) for women with at least four live births, and an interaction OR of 1.05 per live birth and per allele was estimated. This trend was also observed when data from only populationbased studies and from only studies with at least 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls were considered (P = 0.01 in both sub-analyses). Evidence for this interaction was observed when the analysis was restricted to ERpositive and PR-positive disease (P = 0.004 and P = 0.01, respectively; Figure 1), but not for analyses based on ER-negative and PR-negative cases (P = 0.3 and 0.06, respectively). However, considering that 72 tests for interaction were carried out, chance cannot be excluded as an explanation for these results. The multiple-test-adjusted P-value for the modification of the 11p15-rs3817198 association by number of live births was 0.12. The adjusted p-values for all other interactions tested were all ≥0.61.",1
10,16,"Post-hoc power calculations estimated that for age at menarche (per year), parity (per live birth) and age at first birth (per five-year age increase), our study had 90% power at a significance level of 0.0007 (corresponding to a multiple-testing-adjusted P-value of 0.05) to detect interaction ORs of at least 1.06 for all loci tested except CASP8-rs17468277, for which the minimum was 1.08. For BMI (per five-unit increase) the minimum interaction OR detectable with 90% power in both age strata (<55 and ≥55) was 1.08 for the more common variants and 1.10 for CASP8-rs17468277. For parity, considered as never or ever having had a live birth, the study had similar power to detect interaction ORs of at least 1.20 for CASP8-rs17468277 and 1.16 for the remaining loci.",1
10,17,"This combined analysis of more than 25,000 cases and 30,000 controls found no conclusive evidence that age at menarche, parity, age at first birth or BMI modify the established associations of breast cancer risk with 10q26rs298158 (FGFR2), 8q24-rs13281615, 11p15-rs3817198 (LSP1), 5q11-rs889312 (MAP3K1], 16q12-rs2803662 (TOX3), 2q35-rs13387042, 5p12-rs10941679, 17q23rs6504950, 3p24-rs4973768 and CASP8-rs17468277) nor the putative associations with TGFB1-rs1982073 or ESR1rs3020314. This was also true for disease subtypes defined by ER and PR status.",1
10,18,"The strongest evidence of effect modification was for number of live births and 11p15-rs3817198 (LSP1). However, the observed trend of increasing relative risk with increasing parity was not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. It should be noted that the interaction OR was 1.05 per allele and per live birth. This corresponds to an estimated per-allele OR increasing from 1.04 for women with one child to 1.24 for women with four or more children, for a SNP with an estimated average OR of 1.08 across all levels of parity. Such weak interactions would only result in very small differences in estimates of joint effects relative to those from models assuming multiplicative effects. This finding in this very large study highlights the difficulty of identifying modifying effects of this magnitude.",1
10,19,"A recent study by Travis et al. of 7,610 cases and 10,196 controls reported null results for interactions in breast cancer susceptibility between 9 of the same genetic loci and 10 risk factors, including age at menarche, parity, age at first birth and BMI [19]. Our null findings replicate the results from this prospective study of older women (over age 50 years), but in a study with more than twice the sample size in this age group, and confirm that they are also applicable to women under age 50 years. Our study also extends the genetic loci evaluated for interactions with a subset of established breast cancer risk factors to include 17q23rs6504950 and 3p24-rs4973768 [1] and ESR1-rs3020314 [7], which were not considered by Travis et al. [19]. Furthermore, with regard to the susceptibility locus at 5p12, we considered the more strongly associated SNP rs10941679 rather than rs981782 (which is only weakly correlated with rs10941679) [5]. Of note, Travis et al. found no evidence of interaction between 11p15rs3817198 (LSP1) and number of children (P = 0.9) [19].",1
10,20,"One of the strengths of the BCAC is the large combined sample size achieved through international collaboration. This has proven to be very effective in confirming or ruling out association with breast cancer for common SNPs identified through GWAS and candidate gene studies [1,2,6,14,20,21]. The BCAC has also been able to provide highly precise estimates of the ORs associated with susceptibility alleles, with very high consistency observed between the many studies that participate in the consortium, despite the range of study designs represented. The inclusion of multiple studies that recruited selected cases and/or volunteer controls means that the main effects for some risk factors cannot be appropriately evaluated across the whole consortium. However, this potential selection bias in estimating main effects should not influence the assessment of interactions [22]. Nevertheless, we carried out sensitivity analyses considering only data from population-based studies and only data from studies with at least 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls and observed no substantial change in the results obtained regarding interactions.",1
10,21,"A potential limitation of our study derives from heterogeneity in data collection methods across studies. All studies except two (neither population-based) used structured questionnaires administered by a variety of means, including in-person interviews, phone-interviews and self-administration. Nevertheless, the measurement of age at menarche, ever having had a live birth, number of live births and age at first birth seem likely to be robust to these differences in data collection method. Our results for BMI may be more likely to be affected by heterogeneity in data collection methods, although standardized measurement within studies and adjustment for study as a covariate should limit this to a loss of power, rather than any systematic bias. We repeated our primary analyses excluding cases interviewed before, or more than two years after, their breast cancer diagnosis and results were not substantially different. This suggests that between-study differences in the reference time at which BMI was reported did not influence the inference from our study. A further limitation of our study was that we did not collate information on hormone therapy (HT) use from the majority of participating studies and so were unable evaluate interactions between SNPs and BMI by HT use in older women.",1
10,22,"In summary, in the largest collaborative analyses of gene-environment interactions carried out to date, we have observed no conclusive evidence for modification of the per-allele relative risk associated with common breast cancer susceptibility variants by age at menarche, parity, age at first birth or BMI. This finding is consistent with those from a recently published smaller prospective study. These results imply that the combined effects of these common susceptibility alleles and other established risk factors can be assumed to multiplicative in risk predicted models for breast cancer.",1
11,1,"Anopheles funestus is the major malaria vector in southern Africa. Early records of its involvement in malaria transmission give Plasmodium falciparum parasite rates as high as 22% in South Africa [1].

In 1999/2000, however, South Africa experienced its worst malaria outbreak since the introduction of IRS in the 1950’s and An. funestus was found once again in northern KwaZulu/ Natal, just south of Mozambique [5,6]. The P. falciparum parasite rate in An. funestus was 5.4% and the mosquitoes were found to be resistant to both pyrethroids and carbamates.",1
11,3,"Subsequent research in southern Mozambique showed that the insecticide resistant population of An. funestus extended north of the capital, Maputo [7-9]. Most recently, resistance was found in An. funestus from Chokwe [10], approximately 200 km north of the capital, where previously this population was found to be susceptible [8].",1

The island is a series of outcrops and the housing on the island consists mainly of scattered homesteads with residents engaged in fishing and smallscale subsistence farming. Many houses were searched for mosquitoes mostly without success, but a substantial An. funestus population was found in a few houses close to a small area being used for rice cultivation.",1

(five specimens did not amplify a PCR product and one specimen was identified as An. funestus-like). All males and females of the An. gambiae complex (wild adults and adults reared from larvae, n = 89) were identified as An. arabiensis.",1
11,11,"Of the 81 wild An. funestus females tested for parasite infection, 4.9% were positive for P. falciparum using the ELISA method.",1
11,12,"The results of the first insecticide susceptibility tests, carried out on the island using wild female An. funestus of unknown age, are given in Table 1. Since the controls gave >5% mortality, Abbott’s formula [14] was used to correct the results, giving 77.8% mortality on deltamethrin and 56.4% on bendiocarb. The papers used in the field were tested in the laboratory using a susceptible An. gambiae colony and gave 100% mortality for all samples and replicates (n = 100 for each insecticide).",1
11,13,The second round of insecticide susceptibility tests was carried out in the laboratory at 25°C and 85% RH using 1-5 day old An. funestus females pooled from approximately 120 egg batches. Nine different insecticides from all four classes were tested and the results are given in Table 2.,1
11,14,"Unfortunately, the An. arabiensis sample reared from larvae was too small (n = 42 females) to carry out meaningful susceptibility tests.",1
11,15,"The marked difference between the deltamethrin susceptibility tests carried out on wild females in the field and those on the laboratory reared, 1-5 day old F-1 progeny (p <0.005), can be explained in two ways. One, high temperatures are known to affect the survival of mosquitoes exposed to insecticides [15] and this may account for the high mortality in the field samples. Two, An. funestus susceptibility to this sub-class of pyrethroids may be age dependent [16]. Since the survey was carried out in May towards the end of the transmission season, it is likely that the wild-caught females tested in the field were an aging population and were therefore more susceptible to the insecticides. However, Hunt et al. [16] also report that blood fed, mated, females did not show any decrease in resistance over time, and aging wild populations would all be mated and have taken numerous blood meals.",1
11,16,"It is clear from the susceptibility results that a resistance management strategy will have to be devised and implemented in order to control malaria on the island. If pyrethroid treated bed nets are to be distributed widely on Likoma Island, then IRS must be carried out simultaneously with an organophosphate or DDT in order to manage the resistance. Carbamates are unfortunately not an option with such a high frequency of survival. The An. funestus population is fully susceptible to DDT, which raises the possibility of using DDT for IRS perhaps in a rotation with one of the organophosphates.",1
11,17,"There is already extensive use of bed nets on the island with an assortment of treated and untreated nets, old and new, damaged and intact. There is also obvious variation in usage. Frequently, nets were present in the house but not being used. If a combination of bed nets and IRS is under consideration, an important component of such a strategy must be education and monitoring of net use. When the mosquito populations decrease, either due to seasonal change or in response to control measures, many people will stop using the nets. It is also a reality that in a community where livelihood depends on fishing, some nets will be used for this purpose (Figure 2).",1
11,18,"The most worrying aspect of this survey is the discovery of pyrethroid and carbamate resistance in the An. funestus population approximately 1,500 km north (Figure 1) of its current known distribution at Chokwe in southern Mozambique [10]. The report by Casimiro et al. [9] on samples collected from central Mozambique in 2006 showed that An. funestus had >95% mortality to pyrethroids and carbamates. The WHO criteria recommend that this percentage of susceptibility requires further investigation, but operationally it is unlikely that a control programme would change its policy based on this frequency of resistance/susceptibility.",1
11,19,"Likoma Island in Lake Malawi is just a few kilometres away from Mozambique and presumably the mosquitoes are either blown over by the wind or brought on boats that ply their trade between the island and the mainland. One must assume, therefore, that the An. funestus population in northern Mozambique is also resistant and this has serious implications for current malaria control efforts being undertaken in this region. Since both pyrethroid and carbamate resistance has been found in the Likoma population, mirroring the resistance found in more southerly populations, it can be assumed that the resistance is spreading northwards through the An. funestus populations through gene flow, and not arising as separate genetic mutation events. There are no obvious geographical barriers to gene flow in this region of southern Africa and presumably we can expect the resistance to spread northwards into southern Tanzania and westwards into Zambia and Zimbabwe. The recently reported resistance in An. funestus from Uganda [17] is obviously different to that observed in southern African populations, based on both susceptibility tests and molecular characterization of the P450 genes [5,16,18,19].",1
11,20,This paper highlights the seriousness of the rapid spread of insecticide resistance in An. funestus in southern Africa and the urgent need for resistance management strategies within malaria vector control programmes within the region.,1
12,1,"Angiogenesis is a process by which new blood vessels are formed from pre-existing ones [1]. In physiological conditions, this process is strictly controlled by a set of molecules that can either activate the process (proangiogenic factors) or inhibit it (antiangiogenic factors) [2]. During the last decades, it has been widely established that solid tumors have abnormal hyperactivation of angiogenesis [2]. Among the factors that can trigger angiogenesis, the lack of oxygen (hypoxia) is of special importance. Virtually all solid tumors eventually activate angiogenesis in order to overcome lack of oxygen and nutrients after reaching a certain burden [3,4]. One of the most important mediators of hypoxia-activated angiogenesis is the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF-A), produced by tumor cells after sensing low oxygen levels [5,6]. VEGF-A expression can also be induced by non-hypoxia mediated activation, such as Ras signalling [7].",1
12,2,"VEGF-A is a key player in tumor-induced angiogenesis, and its overexpression has been found in most solid tumor types [6]. VEGF-A acts through its cognate receptors VEGFR1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR2 (Flk-1/KDR), in endothelial and bone marrow-derived cells [6,8]. The VEGF pathway has been used as a major target to block tumor angiogenesis. A set of molecules that bind and inhibit different components of the VEGF-A pathway have been developed during the past years. Some of them have already reached the clinical practice, such as bevacizumab (Avastin®, Genentech), a monoclonal antibody that binds and inactivates VEGF-A, or sunitinib (Sutent®, Pfizer), a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor that blocks phosphorylation of several tyrosine-kinase receptors including VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 [9,10].",1
12,3,"The VEGF-A gene contains 8 exons, which can give rise to 5 main alternatively spliced isoforms (VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF189 and VEGF206) [6]. Alternative translation codons upstream of the canonical ATG codon can be used, so that longer isoforms can also be generated [11]. However, the relative importance of these members is still undetermined. Recently, a novel set of isoforms, the so-called “b-isoforms” or “VEGFxxxb” isoforms, have been described. These transcripts of the VEGF-A gene code for polypeptides with the same length as the classical ones, because exon 8 (present in all the formerly known isoforms) is substituted by an alternatively spliced exon of the same size (exon 8b) [12]. These isoforms were therefore named VEGF121b, VEGF165b, VEGF189b etc. In the classically studied isoforms, exon 8 is known to be important for receptor activation [13]. Thus, the “b-isoforms”, where exon 8 is substituted by another peptide sequence, were hypothesized to act as potential antagonists of VEGF-A receptors [14]. Several reports have indeed shown that VEGF165b may have anti-angiogenic properties [14,15], while others cast some doubts about such activities, suggesting that it may act as a VEGF-A receptor agonist [16,17].",1
12,4,"Another interesting issue is the possible differential expression between “angiogenic” vs. “antiangiogenic” isoforms in pathologies where development of aberrant vasculature is involved, including cancer. Previous studies have shown in a limited number of samples, using semiquantitative RT-PCR, that VEGFxxxb isoforms are highly expressed in normal prostate, colon and kidney compared to their malignant counterparts [14,18,19]. It was proposed that formation of neovasculature in pathological conditions would modify alternative splicing of VEGFA, thus promoting the expression of the “b-isoforms” (supposedly anti-angiogenic) at the expense of the classical angiogenic family of isoforms. This would also be extremely interesting because expression of the ratio VEGFxxxb/VEGF could be utilized as a biomarker of angiogenic disease [13].",1
12,5,"Since a therapeutic approach using recombinant VEGFxxxb proteins is very attractive, but the biological activity of such transcripts is not yet clear, we sought to produce recombinant VEGF121b and VEGF165b proteins in the yeast Pichia pastoris, and constructed expression vectors to overexpress these isoforms, in order to further elucidate their role in cancer models. In addition, we analyzed protein expression of VEGFxxxb and total VEGF in normal mammary glands and 50 breast cancer samples, using specific antibodies previously characterized.",1
12,6,"Oligonucleotides were purchased to Sigma-GenoSys (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The primers VF (5’GAAACCATGAACTTTCTGCTGTCTT3’) and V121bR (5’ TTAAGCTTTCAGTCTTTCCTGGTGAGAGATTTTTCTTGTCTTGCTCTATC3’) were used to clone the VEGF121b isoform by PCR into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). VF and V165bR (5’ TTAAGCTTTCAGTC-TTTCCTGGTGAGAGATCTGCAAGTACGTTCGTTTAACTC 3’) were used to clone VEGF165b. Note that initiation codon is underlined in VF and both reverse oligonucleotides contain HindIII restriction sites (bold). VEGF121b and VEGF165 b coding sequences were then subcloned into the pCDNA3.1(-)Neo expression plasmid. The primer VPPF (5’ GGTCTCGAGAAAAGAGAGGCTGAAGCTGCACCCATGGCAGAAGG 3’), together with V121bR or V165bR, was used to clone VEGF121b and VEGF165b coding sequences lacking the signal peptide (ΔPSVEGFxxxb) into the pPICZalphaC vector (Invitrogen) for production of recombinant proteins in the yeast Pichia pastoris, where the alpha-factor signal peptide is used to achieve extracellular expression of the VEGFxxxb sequences.",1
12,7,"The pPICZalphaC plasmids carrying the ΔPS-VEGFxxxb sequences were linearized, gel-purified, and measured for concentration. 80 μL of Pichia pastoris cells were mixed with 5 μg of linearized-plasmid in 1 mm-wide electroporation cuvettes (Bio-Rad). Electroporation was carried out in a Gene-pulser II (Bio-Rad) using the preset yeast conditions. After electroporation, 1 mL of 1 M sorbitol was added to the cuvettes and the electroporated cells were transferred to sterile microtubes. Yeasts were incubated at 30°C for 2 h and then spread in YPDSZ plates (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% sorbitol, 2% agar and 100 μg/mL zeocin) and incubated for 9 days at 29°C. Zeocin-resistant colonies were picked and grown in YPD medium. Yeast clones were transferred to BMGY medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 0.00004% Biotin, 1 U/mL gentamycin sulphate, and 1% glycerol) to allow cells to grow exponentially for 30 h at 29°C and thorough shaking. Yeasts were then centrifuged and resuspended in BMMY medium (thesame composition as BMGY but containing 1% methanol instead of glycerol) to induce protein production.",1
12,8,"Supernatants were collected 24 hours after incubation at 29°C and thorough shaking, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine the best clone producing each of the VEGF121/165b isoforms. Selected clones were grown at 29°C in 2 L of BMGY for 2 days and then changed to BMMY inducing medium, in order to produce large amounts of recombinant products. For purification, nickel-affinity chromatography was used. A Hi-Trap chelating column (Amersham) was connected to an AKTÄ High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) device (Amersham). Pichia pastoris supernatants containing recombinant VEGF121/165b proteins were diluted in binding buffer (0.02 M sodium phosphate, 1 M NaCl, pH 7.2; all reagents from Sigma) and loaded into the HPLC device. Elution buffer (0.02 M sodium phosphate, 1 M NH4Cl, 500 mM Imidazole, pH 7.2; all reagents from Sigma, except for imidazole, purchased from Merck) was loaded, and gradually mixed with binding buffer with an increasing proportion of elution buffer. Fractions of 1 mL were collected throughout the process.",1
12,9,"Purified proteins after affinity chromatography were depleted from eluting medium and changed to PBS through dialysis, using Slide-A-lyzer cassettes (Pierce) with a 10 KDa threshold pore. Cassettes were filled with eluted protein and drawn in 3L of PBS, overnight. This step was repeated with new PBS for 6 more hours. Dialyzed proteins were extracted from the cassettes with syringes and snap frozen.",1
12,10,"For protein extraction, cultured cells were lysed for 30 min at 4°C in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate; all reagents from Sigma) plus a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Switzerland). Samples were then centrifuged at 13000 rpm. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). In the case of conditioned culture media, supernatants were centrifuged to get rid of any cell debris and 20-fold concentrated by centrifugation for 45 min, using 15-KDa Amicon Ultra centricons (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).",1
12,11,"Proteins were electrophoresed in Bis-Tris buffered gels (Novex gels, Invitrogen) in either reducing or non-reducing conditions, following standard procedures. 20 μg protein solution (in RIPA buffer) were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Electrophoresis was carried out in 1X running buffer for 90 min at 130V and room temperature. Proteins were directly stained in the gel with Coomassie blue or transferred to PVDF membranes for immunodetection. Deglycosylation analysis of VEGFxxxb proteins (90 μM) was treated with 0.8 mM Endo F1 and incubated for 1 h at 37°C; cleavage was monitored by SDS-PAGE.",1
12,12,"Membranes for western blots were rinsed twice with PBS-tween, blocked with PBST plus 5% skim milk for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibodies. Antibodies against VEGF (MAB293, R&D; and sc-152, Santa Cruz), VEGFxxxb (MAB3045, R&D), pKDR, total KDR, pERK1/2, total ERK1/2, and GAPDH (all of these latter ones from Cell Signalling) were used. Then, horseradish peroxidase-labelled secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) against the corresponding primary antibodies were added. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by a chemoluminescent method using the Lumi-lightPLUS kit (Roche).",1
12,13,"HUVECs, PC3 and A549 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). PC3 and A549 cells were maintained in complete medium, consisting of: RPMI-1640 growth medium (Invitrogen) with Glutamax®, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (both antibiotics from Invitrogen). HUVECs were maintained in EGM-MV2 medium (Lonza) containing human recombinant EGF, VEGF, FGF, IGF-1, hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid and 2% FBS. Cell culture medium with 1% serum was used to analyze cells supernatants by western blot.",1
12,14,"Purified plasmidic DNA was introduced into mammalian cells through cationic lipid-based transfection with the reagent Lipofectamine 2000, according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Transfected cells were selected and maintained with complete medium plus 300 μg/mL (PC3) or 500 μg/mL (A549) G418.",1
12,15,"Two different methods were used to assess cell proliferation. The first method consisted of the MTT (SigmaAldrich, Italy) assay. Cells were seeded in 50 μL 2% FBS-containing growth medium in 96-well culture plates and allowed to attach overnight. Two-fold concentrated recombinant human VEGF165 (rhVEGF165, Apollo Cytokine Research), recombinant human VEGF 121 b and VEGF 165 b produced in Pichia pastoris (VEGF 121 b(pp) and VEGF165b(pp)), recombinant human VEGF165b produced in CHO cells (VEGF165b(hs)), kindly provided by Dr. David O. Bates (Microvascular Research Laboratories, Department of Physiology, University of Bristol, UK), or the VEGFRs inhibitor GW654652 (GlaxoSmithKline) were added. In each time point, 10 μL 5% MTT solution was added to each well. Plates were incubated for additional 3 h at 37°C. The resulting formazan crystals were finally solubilized by administration of 100 μl 10% SDS in 50% N-N-Dimethylformamide to each microplate well. Absorbance at 550 nm was measured using a TECAN Sunrise microplate reader. Wells containing only complete medium were used as controls. Each experiment was performed three times using six replicates for each drug concentration.",1
12,16,"The second method consisted of analysis of DNA synthesis by incorporation of the modified nucleotide EdU, using the Click-it reaction according to the manufacture’s instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were plated at 50% confluence and treated with 50 or 100 ng/mL of rhVEGF 165 , VEGF 121 b(pp), VEGF 165 b(pp), or bFGF overnight. Cells were then incubated for 1h with 5mM EdU solution, washed, trypsinized, fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with Alexa-Fluor-647 dye in the presence of copper for catalysis of the Click-it reaction. Cells were analyzed with a FACScalibur flow cytometer to determine EdU incorporation.",1
12,17,"Nu/Nu mutant athymic mice (Balb/C genetic background) were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Barcelona, Spain) and maintained in SPF (Specific Pathogen Free) standard conditions. One million PC3 or five million A549 cells and their corresponding transfectants in exponential growth phase were resuspended in 200 μL PBS and injected subcutaneously in the flanks of Nu/Nu mice. Tumor measurements were done with precision callipers and animals were sacrificed before tumors reached 1.7 cm in diameter. Experiments were conducted according to the guidelines for ethical use of animals of our Institution (CIMA-University of Navarra) under an approved protocol. Tumors were harvested and fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Primary tumor volumes were calculated with the formula: V = length × (width)^2/2.",1
12,18,"For Matrigel plug assays, 400 μL Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel (BD) were mixed with 100 ng of rhVEGF165, VEGF121b(pp), VEGF165b(pp), or bFGF (as positive control) in 100 μL PBS and injected subcutaneously in Nu/Nu mice. One week after cell inoculation, mice were injected retro-orbitally with 100 mL Fluorescein-labelled dextran (3 mg/mL) or with Alexa-647labelled isolectin B4 (100 μg/mL). After 15 min, mice were sacrifized, and the Matrigel plugs were explanted and analyzed under a Zeiss Axiovert confocal microscope.",1
12,19,"Tissues (xenografted tumors or matrigel plugs) were obtained from the in vivo experiments, fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Tissue Microarray (TMA) slides were obtained from AccuMax (Seoul, Korea; catalogue # A202(I)). This TMA contains 100 breast tissue cores from 50 patients and 8 tissue cores from 4 normal breast tissue obtained by mammoplasty. Breast cancer types include 33 infiltrating ductal carcinomas, 7 papillary carcinomas, 3 phyllodes tumors, 4 infiltrating lobular carcinomas, and 3 samples corresponding to other breast cancer tumor types.",1
12,20,"For immunohistochemistry, slides were deparaffinized, hydrated, and incubated for 10 min with 3% H 2 O 2 in water to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity. An antigen retrieval method was used for detection of the antibodies. Dilutions of primary antibodies were as follows: 1:200 for Caspase 3 (Cleaved Caspase-3 Asp 175, Cell Signaling); 1:20 for CD-31 (Dianova); 1:100 for PDGFRb (Cell Signaling); 1:200 for VEGF (Santa Cruz); 1:50 for VEGFxxxb (R&D). Primary antibodies were incubated at 4°C overnight or for 1 h at RT in the case of CD31. Tissues were washed in TBS and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody. Afterwards, slides were incubated for 30 min with the EnVision™ antirabbit detection system (Dako). Peroxidase activity was carried out with DAB (Dako). Finally, slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. For quantifications of immunohistochemistry in xenografted tumor sections, 10 random images (200×) per mouse were captured with a microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with the Analysis™ software. Positive cells were quantified with Image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).",1
12,21,"For quantification of FITC-dextran and Alexa-647 Isolectin B4 in sections of Matrigel plugs, slides were analyzed with an Axiovert (Carl Zeiss, Germany) epifluorescence microscope and 10 random pictures of each Matrigel were taken. Labelled area was measured with the ImageJ software.",1
12,22,"Data sets were tested for normal distribution with Shapiro-Wilks and Kolgomorov-Smirnoff tests. Levene’s test was also performed to verify homogeneity of variances. In those cases where tests displayed normal distribution, ANOVA was performed to test for possible differences among groups. Bonferroni correction was used for post-hoc comparison in the case of variance homogeneity, whereas Tamhane’s correction was the choice in the case of Levene’s positive test. For non-normal distributed data sets, non-parametric tests were applied: Kruskal-Wallis for multiple comparisons and Mann-Whitney’s U-test with significance correction for double comparisons of independent samples. Wilcoxon’s test was carried out for dependent sample data. To run these tests, The SPSS software was used. Results with a pvalue < 0.05 were considered significant (*), and those with a p-value < 0.01 (**), or <0.001 (***), very significant.",1
12,23,"Figure 1 shows a scheme of the different exons included in each of the “classical” VEGF-A isoforms and the “VEGFxxxb” isoforms. The coding sequence for both VEGF121b and VEGF165b, lacking the native human signal peptide, was cloned into the pPICZalphaC plasmid. The native human signal peptide sequence was substituted by the yeast alpha-factor signal peptide in these constructs, which is known to be very efficient for secretion in Pichia pastoris. To obtain top-quality recombinant proteins, VEGFxxxb was purified from Pichia pastoris culture supernatants through nickel-affinity chromatography. Figure 2A shows a chromatographic image of the procedure. Recombinant VEGF 121 b was eluted in a gradient of 20% imidazole. Peak 1 corresponds to all unbound substances, which run through the column. Peak 2 corresponds to proteins eluted with approximately 12.5% of imidazole (Figure 2A). Similar results were found for VEGF165b (not shown). Figure 2B shows Coomasie blue staining of different aliquots taken during elution of VEGF121b around peak 2, where the bands correspond to the expected size of VEGF 121 b. These results show that nickel-affinity is an efficient method to purify VEGFxxxb proteins from Pichia pastoris culture supernatants.",1
12,24,"Electrophoresed culture media from Pichia pastoris clones obtained after electroporation with the linearized VEGF 121b or VEGF 165 b sequence containing pPICZaphaC plasmids and selection with zeocin for one week is shown in Figure 2C. Bands of the expected molecular masses were detected in supernatants from Pichia pastoris clones. The amount of ectopic protein was clearly visible among the total secreted proteins by this yeast. The clones overexpressing higher amounts of recombinant VEGFxxxb proteins were chosen for large-scale production. Importantly, Pichia pastoris-derived recombinant proteins were immunoreactive to the currently available (and previously validated) commercial antibody (R&D) against VEGFxxxb (Figure 2D).",1
12,25,"The band pattern of recombinant human VEGF121/165b isoforms expressed in Pichia pastoris was similar to that of the native VEGFxxx isoforms, as previously described [20]. VEGF121b forms dimers that can be detected in the gel as three bands under non-reducing conditions (Figure 2C). The three bands probably correspond to dimers of glycosylated-glycosylated, glycosylated-non-glycosylated and non-glycosylated-non-glycosylated proteins, as described for the VEGF-A classic isoforms [20]. The same culture supernatants run under reducing conditions showed only two bands (Figure 2C), which would be concordant with the ability of these proteins to dimerize. The same pattern can be seen for VEGF165b (Figure 2C), although the bands are not as clearly seen as for VEGF 121 b. Recombinant VEGFxxxb proteins also formed larger complexes, such as tetramers and octamers, especially in the case of VEGF165b (Figure 2D).",1
12,26,"To assess the glycosylation status of the VEGFxxxb recombinant proteins produced in Picha pastoris, endoglycosidase F1 was used both in reducing and non-reducing conditions (Additional file 1 Figure S1). VEGF121/165 b deglycosylation produced an electrophoretic shift for both isoforms. Molecular weights for both glycosylated and deglycosylated proteins are compatible with those observed for VEGF121 and VEGF165 [20,21].",1
12,27,"The effect of VEGF121/165b recombinant proteins produced in our laboratory (VEGF121b(pp) and VEGF165b (pp)) was first tested on endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. We also tested the effect of a VEGF165b recombinant protein (VEGF165b(hs)) produced in mammalian CHO cells to discard any possible yeast-glycosylationderived effect. A first experiment was conducted with the MTT assay. Addition of 100 ng/mL commercial VEGF165 (from R&D) induced HUVEC proliferation by 63% compared to untreated cells (Figure 3A). Coadministration of VEGF 165 and either VEGF 121 b(pp), VEGF 165 b(pp), or VEGF 165 b(hs) (at the same dose) caused a similar proliferative induction (Figure 3A). Exposure of HUVECs to each one of the recombinant “b-isoforms” alone resulted in ~40% increased proliferation. Administration of the VEGFR-targeting compound GW654652 alone or with VEGF165b(hs) produced similar rates of HUVECs proliferation than untreated control cells (Figure 3A). This result shows the specificity of VEGF165b in inducing VEGFR-mediated endothelial proliferation. Similar results using the VEGFR inhibitor were obtained for VEGF 121 b(pp) and VEGF 165 b(pp) (results not shown).",1
12,28,"To confirm our results on proliferation we used an alternative method, based on DNA incorporation into the cells. As shown in Figure 3B, administration of bFGF and VEGF 165 increased DNA incorporation into HUVECs by 3-fold (p < 0.001), compared to untreated controls. Exposure to VEGF165b(pp) and VEGF121b(pp) also increased significantly (p < 0.01) DNA incorporation into HUVECs by almost 2-fold as compared to controls. Therefore, these experiments parallel those obtained by MTT showing that VEGFxxxb isoforms increase proliferation, although less potently than VEGF165.",1
12,29,"Addition of all VEGF-A proteins to HUVECs induced phosphorylation of the VEGF-A receptor Flk-1/KDR (also known as VEGFR2) and the intracellular kinase ERK1/2 (Figure 4). As expected, VEGF165 caused phosphorylation of KDR and ERK1/2, 10 min after treatment in serum-free conditions (Figure 4). VEGF121/165b proteins induced KDR phosphorylation in HUVECs as well. VEGF121b and VEGF165b, either produced in mammalian cells or in Pichia pastoris stimulated similarly ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Co-administration of VEGF 165 and VEGF121/165b did not prevent VEGF165-induced KDR or ERK1/2 phosphorylation. VEGF165b(pp) failed to activate the KDR-ERK pathway in the presence of the VEGFRs inhibitor GW654652, thus indicating receptor specificity. Similar results were obtained with VEGF 121 b(pp) and VEGF165b (hs) (not shown).",1
12,30,"Matrigel plug assays were done in order to decipher the effect of VEGF121/165b isoforms on endothelial cell function in vivo. Matrigel was mixed with either bFGF, or VEGF165 (from R&D), or VEGF121b(pp), or VEGF165b(pp). Blood vessels within the Matrigel plugs were identified by the presence of Alexa-647-labelled isolectin B4 (Figure 5A), which was injected systemically into the mice before the sacrifize. No signal from the Alexa-647-labelled lectin was observed in control Matrigels, whereas plugs carrying any of the VEGFxxxb isoforms showed a strong signal, thus demonstrating angiogenesis in vivo (Figure 5A). To analyze vascular permeability, FITC-labelled-dextran was injected in another set of mice with Matrigel plugs under similar experimental conditions (Figure 5B). Whereas almost no fluorescent signal was seen in control plugs, in Matrigels that were pre-loaded with bFGF or especially with VEGF121b, a dramatic increase in the fluorescent signal was found. Matrigel plugs carrying either VEGF165 or VEGF 165 b displayed a similar degree of fluorescence, which was approximately 10-fold higher than that of controls.",1
12,31,"A cell line with high (PC-3) and another one with low (A549) endogenous total VEGF expression levels were selected for in vivo assays (Figure 6A). VEGF 121/165 b isoforms were overexpressed in both PC-3 and A549 xenograft models in order to assess the effect of these isoforms in tumor growth and angiogenesis. Western blot analyses showed a high expression of either VEGF121b or VEGF165b in cell pools that were selected with G418 over a period of 20 days (Figure 6A). No statistical differences in tumor growth were seen between controls and tumors overexpressing either VEGF121b, or VEGF165b, or a combination of both in PC3 xenografts (Figure 6B). Moreover, VEGF121b-overexpressing cells tended to form bigger tumors than the rest of the experimental conditions (Figure 6B). In the case of A549 xenografts, significant increases in tumor volumes were found when cells with either VEGF 121 b, or VEGF 165 b were injected, in comparison with controls (Figure 6C). Therefore, overexpression of the VEGF121/ 165 b isoforms does not cause tumor shrinkage but tumor growth in these models.",1
12,32,"Analysis of angiogenesis revealed that A549 tumors were less angiogenic than PC-3 tumors with no differences between controls and the experimental groups (Figure 7). In PC-3, VEGF121b-overexpressing tumors showed a significantly higher (p < 0.05) vascularization than the other experimental groups (Parental, Mock-transfected and VEGF165b). To analyze a possible mural recruitment to the vasculature, levels of PDGFRb were analyzed by immunhostochemistry and image analysis. PDGFRs are expressed in pericytes and bone-marrow-derived cells that participate in blood vessel formation and coverage (22). Therefore, if VEGFxxxb isoforms alter the vascular wall, a decrease in PDGFRb+ cells should be found in comparison with controls. However, no such decrease was observed in either PC-3 or A549 xenografted tumors (Additional File 2 Figure S2). We also quantified the number of apoptotic cells in these tumors, since an anti-angiogenic effect of the VEGFxxxb isoforms should be translated into an increase in apoptosis. In A549 xenografts, no changes were observed in the number of active caspase-3+ cells (Additional File 2 Figure S2). In PC-3 xenografted tumors, not an increase but a reduction in the number of apoptotic cells was observed when VEGFxxxboverexpressing cells were injected, as compared to controls (Additional File 2 Figure S2).",1
12,33,"Previous studies had suggested that VEGFxxxb isoforms can be differentially expressed in normal vs. pathological conditions [13]. To study if this was the case for breast cancer, we used a TMA containing core biopsies from breast cancer patients and normal breasts. To this end, we used a well validated antibody that recognizes total VEGF-A (including all VEGF-A isoforms) (R&D systems) and the only available and validated anti-VEGFxxxb antibody that recognizes all the VEGFxxxb proteins (R&D systems) [18]. No available antibody specific for the “non-b” isoforms (VEGFxxx) is currently available.",1
12,34,"Figures 8A and 8B show representative images of malignant and normal breast tissues stained with the anti-VEGFxxxb and anti-total VEGF-A antibodies. Strong staining for VEGFxxxb could be seen in tumor cells of infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) samples. Staining was also found for other types of tumors, including papillary carcinoma (Pap), phyllodes (Phy), infiltrating lobular carcinomas (ILC), and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). No VEGFxxxb was detected in any of the normal breast tissue (NBT) samples. All tissues analyzed were positive for total-VEGF-A, including the normal breast epithelium. Semiquantification of the staining showed that both total VEGF-A and VEGFxxxb protein levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in IDC than in normal breast tissues (Figures 8C and 8D). A significant (p = 0.033) positive correlation index (r = 0.404) between VEGFxxxb and total-VEGF-A was found, thus indicating the degree of co-staining. Therefore, we conclude that VEGFxxxb levels are not reduced in malignant breast cancer but, on the contrary, tend to increase in the tumor samples and are significantly higher in infiltrating ductal carcinomas.",1
12,35,"The importance of VEGF-A in normal and pathological angiogenesis has been widely explored and documented in the last decades [6]. VEGF-A has become a major target for cancer therapy in solid tumors, and VEGFtargeted drugs, such as bevacizumab or sunitinib are currently being used in patients [9,10]. The biology of VEGF-A spliced isoforms is, however, poorly understood yet. In particular, understanding how the different VEGF-A isoforms are generated through alternative splicing may be important to design more specific and effective molecular therapies.",1
12,36,"In 2002, a new family of VEGF-A isoforms generated by alternative splicing was reported [14,19], which were denominated VEGFxxxb isoforms. These transcripts incorporate a different exon (called exon 8b, sequence SLTRKD) from the classical exon 8a (sequence CDKPRR) found in the angiogenic transcripts [19]. Inclusion of exon 8b was thought to endow VEGFxxxb isoforms with the capacity to bind VEGF-A receptors without strong downstream signalling activation [14]. Because of this property, the VEGFxxxb proteins were hypothesized to be antiangiogenic [14]. Although results have to be interpreted carefully, it was shown that overexpression of VEGF 165 b or VEGF 121 b in tumor cells xenotransplanted into nude mice results in growth inhibition [14,18,23-25]. Another interesting finding that was reported is that VEGFxxxb isoforms may be differentially expressed in pathological tissues compared to normal tissues [13,25,26]. Changes in the natural splicing would favor the amount of the VEGFxxx transcripts in some aberrant angiogenesis-linked diseases, at the expense of reducing the amount of the VEGFxxxb isoforms (mainly expressed in normal tissues).",1
12,37,"Because of the great potential importance of these findings, we aimed in the present study to produce VEGF 121 b and VEGF165b recombinant proteins in the yeast Pichia pastoris, with the goal of testing their antiangiogenic/antitumor properties in vitro and in vivo. Generation of VEGF121/165b-overexpressing cancer cells using the PCDNA3.1 plasmid was also used for this purpose. The yeast expression system was chosen for several reasons. First, this system allows protein glycosylation, and purification with little secretion of yeasts-derived endogenous proteins that may contaminate the recombinant protein of interest. Another advantage is that protein production is easier, faster and cheaper than that generated in mammalian systems. In addition, we made sure with this expression system that no exon 8-containing VEGF-A contamination is present, since yeasts do not code for any form of VEGF. Producing VEGF-A in mammalian cells has the drawback of possible formation of exons 8 and 8b heterodimers. This may be of special importance, since VEGF-A is secreted and active in its dimeric form [6].",1
12,38,"We have successfully produced recombinant VEGF121b and VEGF165b proteins that share similar structural characteristics to those of the classical VEGF121 and VEGF165 proteins: Ability to form dimers or multimers, and reactivity with commercial antibodies that were raised against exons 1 to 5 (common to all VEGF-A isoforms). In addition, both recombinant VEGF121b and VEGF165b proteins were immunoreactive with a validated antibody that recognizes exon 8b (from R&D [18]).",1
12,39,"To test the functionality of these isoforms in vitro, HUVECs were treated with recombinant proteins produced in yeasts, VEGF 165 b produced in mammalian cells, or the “classical” VEGF165 angiogenic protein (as control). All treatments were carried out in serum-free media. We found that VEGF121/165b isoforms induced proliferation of HUVECs and phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and its downstream transducer ERK. The effect of VEGF121/165b isoforms was milder than that found for VEGF165: Proliferation of HUVECs was ~50% less stimulated with VEGF 121/165 b isoforms than that using recombinant VEGF165. However, the degree of ERK activation was similar for all the proteins tested, 10 min after stimulation. This intracellular effector was phosphorylated specifically by VEGFRs, as demonstrated by the inhibition of such process in the presence of the VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 tyrosine-kinase inhibitor GW654652.",1
12,40,"Kawamura et al. [16] have demonstrated that VEGF165b displays unique functional characteristics. They showed VEGF165b to be a weak agonist of VEGFR2 and to induce its phosphorylation in HUVECs with a similar potency as VEGF145. Similarly to VEGF121, VEGF165b does not bind neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and failed to induce complexes between NRP1 and VEGFR2. VEGF165 b promotes cell migration (in PAE cells transfected with VEGFR2), similar to VEGF165, VEGF145, and VEGF121 isoforms. Resembling the activity of VEGF121 and VEGF 145, but unlike VEGF165, VEGF165b does not induce endothelial sprout. But unlike the other isoforms, VEGF165b was unable to phosphorylate the mouse VEGFR2 at the Y1052 position. Unfortunately, downstream signalling activation was not tested in this study [16]. Authors hypothesized that VEGF165b is not able to fully rotate the receptor’s intracellular tail upon binding, thus blocking to some extent transphosphorylation [16]. In addition, Glass et al. [17] have shown that VEGF165b activates transiently VEGFR1 in order to elicit vascular permeability in the mesenteric vein. Collectively, these and our results suggest that VEGF 165 b may exert weak downstream signalling in endothelial cells.",1
12,41,"To further validate the observation of VEGF 121/165b angiogenic properties seen in classical in vitro assays, we conducted in vivo experiments with Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel, in which VEGF, among other angiogenic cytokines, have been significantly depleted. Addition of recombinant VEGF 121 b, or VEGF 165 b, or VEGF 165 caused recruitment of blood vessels to the Matrigel compared to PBS-loaded controls, thus demonstrating an angiogenic effect. It is worth mentioning that VEGF121b-containing Matrigels were highly enriched in dextran-FITC signal, which seemed to be within and out of the vessels (similar to results found for bFGF). This suggests an increase in vascular permeability, in keeping with vascular permeability described for VEGF121 [27].",1
12,42,"The ability to inhibit tumor growth in vivo was tested in our study by VEGF121/165b overexpression in xenograft models. We chose two different cancer cell lines: The low-VEGF-expressing lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line (~1-5 pg/mL (28)) and PC-3, a prostate cancer cell line that secretes ~800 pg/mL; [29]. These cell types were chosen to ascertain possible differences in the VEGFxxxb behavior depending on the endogenous VEGF expression. Experiments were performed without any further exogenous VEGF stimulation, such as transfection of VEGF. In the PC3 xenografts, no statistical differences between controls and VEGF121/165b-expressing tumors were seen. However, a tendency of VEGF121boverexpressing tumors to grow at a faster rate than the other groups was found. In agreement with these results, vascular density for VEGF121 b-overexpressing PC-3 tumors was significantly higher than that observed for the rest of the groups, and apoptotic levels significantly lower. A549 xenografts grew slow and formed small tumors after subcutaneous implantation in nude mice, as previously described [30].",1
12,43,"These results are in conflict with previous reports showing that VEGF 165 b causes anti-tumor effects [14,15,23,24]. Our interpretation for these seemingly contradictory results is as follows: The in vivo models in which the VEGFxxxb isoforms have been proven to be efficacious in reducing tumor growth expressed high VEGF levels (either by the nature of the cells used or by transfection with VEGF-carrying plasmids). In these conditions, both VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb proteins would compete equally for receptor binding. Because VEGFxxxb is only able to signal weakly, a reduced tumor volume will be observed when tumors overexpressing VEGFxxxb are compared to high VEGF-expressing tumors. However, in the case of tumors with low VEGF production, overexpression of VEGFxxxb would stimulate tumor growth to a certain extent. Thus, in CAKI cells, where endogenous total VEGF levels are ~900 pg/mL [23], when both parental and VEGF165b-overexpressing cells were injected into mice, no differences in tumor growth were found. Only when parental cells were transfected with VEGF 165 , a reduction in tumor volume was observed compared to VEGF165b-overexpressing tumors [23].",1
12,44,"It is possible then that therapies based on the administration of VEGFxxxb proteins are effective in tumors with high endogenous VEGF expression. However, the use of this therapy in tumors with low VEGF levels, which likely rely on other angiogenic factors for their growth (such as bFGF, IL-8, etc.) may worsen the evolution of the tumor. Therefore, therapy with VEGFxxxb casts some doubts about its possible use in unselected patients. Caution must be taken in defining which possible patient will benefit from VEGFxxxb-based therapies. Stratifying the patients based on the amount of VEGF production may be critical for future possible clinical trials.",1
12,45,"But before translating this type of therapy, many aspects of the VEGFxxxb biology should be clarified. For instance, it is quite surprising that VEGF121b, although found to inhibit endothelial cell migration, was cytoprotective for endothelial cells (in serum starvation experiments), in a similar way as VEGF 165 [15]. Such cytoprotection involved activation of VEGF receptors and downstream signalling [15]. Even more surprising is the fact that in some xenograft models (for instance using CAKI cells), co-overexpression of VEGF165 and VEGF165b results in tumors that are smaller in size than those generated by overexpression of just VEGF 165 b [23]. Other issues, such as whether or not VEGFxxxb proteins are able to heterodimerize with members of the VEGFxxx angiogenic family, should be clarified as well.",1
12,46,"We have also addressed in this study the issue of whether the VEGFxxxb isoforms may be differentially expressed in malignant tissues (human breast cancer) compared to healthy tissues (normal mammary gland). For our experiments we used immunohistochemistry with validated antibodies specific for all VEGFxxxb isoforms and antibodies that recognize all VEGF transcripts. Our results revealed that both total VEGF and VEGFxxxb levels tended to increase in breast cancer samples (n = 50) compared to normal breast tissues (n = 8). This increase was statistically significant for intraductal carcinomas (IDC). Expression of both total VEGF and VEGFxxxb were significantly correlated, thus suggesting that both families of VEGF (VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb) follow a similar pattern of expression.",1
12,47,"Previous studies have analyzed, in a limited number of samples, expression of the VEGFxxxb isoforms. Whereas total VEGF mRNA levels were found significantly upregulated in colon carcinoma samples (n = 6) compared to controls, no changes were observed for VEGFxxxb mRNA levels [18]. This result shows that the increase in total VEGF is due to the VEGFxxx angiogenic isoforms [18]. A similar result was found analyzing protein levels by isoform-specific ELISAs [18]. RT-PCR analysis showed that VEGF165b was present in 17 of 18 normal kidney samples, but only in 4 of 18 matched malignant tissues [19]. Immunohistochemical analysis of 19 melanoma samples (9 metastatic and 10 nonmetastatic) using the VEGFxxxb specific antibody, found a decrease in VEGFxxxb expression in the neoplastic tissue (especially in metastasis) compared to the normal skin [25].",1
12,48,"The lack of appropriate antibodies specific for each of the VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb proteins hinders the fine characterization of the pattern of expression in malignant and normal tissues. Future studies using larger number of samples, and quantitative real time RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses would be needed to assess whether VEGFxxxb expression could be used as a cancer biomarker.",1
12,49,"Our results demonstrate that VEGF121/165b are not antiangiogenic, but weakly angiogenic isoforms of VEGF-A that may foster tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. We also conclude that VEGFxxxb isoforms (as well as total VEGF levels) are up-regulated in breast cancer in comparison with non malignant breast tissues.",1
13,1,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease [1]. In contrast to most other coronaviruses, which cause mild infection, the new SARS-CoV has a high mortality rate. Because the re-emergence of SARS is possible due to existence of SARS-CoV like strains in animal reservoir, development of safe and effective vaccines is highly desired. The SARS-CoV genome is composed of single positive stranded RNA and encodes four main structural proteins including spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E) and nucleocapsid protein (N) [2]. The S protein is involved in not only receptor recognition but also in virus attachment and its entry into target cells [3].",1
13,2,"In attempts to develop vaccines against various pathogens, research on DNA vaccine has been widely carried out. Using DNA vaccines, both humoral and cellular immune responses are induced [4]. A few studies demonstrated that DNA-based vaccines can induce protective immune response against several viruses [5,6]. However, one of the problems with DNA-based vaccines is that they are incapable of inducing immune response in mice when injected through the intranasal (i.n.) route [7]. In light of the fact that the entry of most respiratory diseases is through the mucosal surface, it is obvious and ideal that a vaccine should induce both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Secretory IgA plays a major role in mediating mucosal immunity [8]. Mucosal immune responses take an important role as a first line of immune defense system against influenza virus infection although parenteral immunization is not enough to provoke protective immunity [9].",1
13,3,"Polyethylenimine (PEI) has been widely used as the nonviral vector in vitro and in vivo due to high transfection efficiency and buffering capacity [10]. It has been shown that mucosal administration with PEI could function as a potent mucosal immunostimulator [11]. It has been revealed that PEI is a very effective gene delivery vehicle for lung transfection producing high antibody titers against the encoded protein [12]. In the present study, the immune responses in BALB/c mice immunized with SARS DNA vaccine via i.n. route have been examined.",1
13,4,"It is well known that transfection efficiency of gene carrier depends upon its ability to condense DNA into nano-sized particles [13]. As expected, PEI condensed DNA into nano-sized particles, suggesting their endocytosis potential (Figure 1A).",1
13,5,"The formation of PEI/pci-S nanoparticles was further confirmed by morphology observation. Representative energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) images of the PEI/pci-S nanoparticles at N/P ratio 10 are shown in Figure 1B. The nanoparticles were observed as spherical shape with around 200 nm size, which are similar to those measured by dynamic light scattering. It is notable that cytotoxicity of PEI was measured in RAW 264.7 cells after transfection with PEI/pci-S complexes by using MTT assay. The cell viabilities decreased slightly when the N/P ratios of PEI/pci-S complexes increased. When the N/P ratio was 10, the cell viability was 87.5 ± 7.3% (data not shown). In order to confirm PEI/pci-S uptaken by RAW264.7 cells, rhodamine labeled pci-S DNA was used to form the nanoparticles with the PEI and the complex was visualized by confocal microscopy. As shown in Figure 1C, the labeled nanoparticles can be seen in the cells, near to the nucleus. RT-PCR analysis showed both pci-S DNA and PEI/pci-S nanoparticles can transfect the cells. In fact, the PEI/pci-S nanoparticles induced much stronger S mRNA expression than that of naked DNA (Figure 1D).",1
13,6,"To evaluate the influence of PEI on adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV S protein, specific antibody responses were examined in mice immunized i.n. with SARS-CoV DNA vaccine. Immunization with PEI/pci-S complexes elicited high level of SARS-CoV S-specific-serum IgG antibody but not in mice immunized with SARS-CoV S DNA alone (Figure 2A). To access the balance of Th1/ Th2 response, SARS S-specific IgG1 and IgG2 were evaluated in immunized mice. SARS S-specific IgG1 antibody was significantly (P < 0.01) increased in mice immunized with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine plus PEI whereas little increase was observed on SARS-specific IgG2a antibody production (Figure 2A), indicating Th2 dominant response. To examine mucosal antibody production, lung wash, nasal wash, fecal extracts, saliva and vaginal wash of immunized mice were collected. The result showed that SARS S-specific IgA antibody response was significantly (P < 0.01) increased in lung wash from mice immunized with PEI/pci-S complexes (Figure 2B).",1
13,7,"To assess B lymphocyte proliferation against SARSCoV spike protein, the notion that antibody responses enhanced was further confirmed by proliferation ability of B220+ cells at 1 week after the last vaccination. B220+ cells from mice immunized with PEI/pci-S complexes were highly proliferated after in vitro re-stimulation with SARS-CoV S protein (Figure 2C).",1
13,8,"The maturation of DCs is accompanied with enhanced expression of surface markers, including co-stimulatory and MHC class molecules. To examine the effect of DNA vaccination on DC maturation in vivo, mice were immunized i.n. with PEI/pci-S complexes. The surface expression of CD80 and CD86 co-stimulatory molecules were significantly (P < 0.05) higher on DCs from mice treated with PEI/pci-S complexes than those from SARS-CoV DNA S vaccine alone (Figure 3). MHC class II, I-Ad, expression was also up-regulated significantly (P < 0.05) in PEI/pci-S complexes group as compared with that of SARS-CoV DNA alone (Figure 3).",1
13,9,"To examine T cell immunity to SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine, cytokine profiles were examined by using intracellular cytokine assays. The cells were harvested from the lung at 6 days after the immunization. It has been suggested that T cells producing IFN-g, IL-2, IL-17, and TNF-a are especially effective in protective immunity [14]. Amount of IFN-g-producing cells were increased in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from mice immunized with PEI/pci-S whereas IL-17-producing cells were increased only in CD4 + , not CD8 + T cells. It is notable that IFN-g + , IL-2 + and IL-17 + cells were not detected in CD8 + T cells from the mice immunized with PEI/pci-S complexes (Figure 4A and 4B). Re-stimulation with SARS-CoV S peptide induced the activation of cytokineproducing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a predominant production of TNF-a as well as TNF-a and IL-2 double cytokine-producing T cells in mice immunized with PEI/pci-S complexes (Figure 4A and 4B). Furthermore, IFN-g and IL-17 double cytokine-producing cells were found more in the PEI/pci-S complexes group while it was not detectable in pci-S group. It is to note that IL4-producing cells were detectable neither in the lung nor spleen (data not shown).",1
13,10,"In the twenty first century, SARS was the first emerging infectious disease that has seriously threatened public health and the economy throughout the world [1]. Over 8,000 people from 26 countries were infected with SARScoronavirus, resulting 774 deaths [15]. It has been shown that SARS-CoV spike protein (S) plays an important role in receptor recognition, virus attachment and its entry [16]. It represented one of the most important targets for the development of SARS vaccine [6]. To prevent and control SARS outbreaks, several vaccine studies based on the spike protein of SARS have been done including S protein vaccine, fragment DNA vaccine, full-length DNA vaccines and receptor binding domain [17]. DNA vaccine encoding full-length S protein has shown to induce humoral, cellular and protective immune responses against SARS-CoV [6]. In the current study, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a PEI/pci-S in mice through intranasal immunization.",1
13,11,"There have been several reports that PEI/DNA complexes enhance transfection efficiency in mammalian cells and augment immunogenicity [18]. In the present study, we have adapted this PEI/pci-S complex for mucosal DNA vaccination. The size of PEI/pci-S complexes appeared to be about 200 nm. The effect of PEI/DNA complexes on transfection, and gene and protein expression in RAW 264.7 cells were evaluated by measuring the expression of the mRNA and protein, respectively. This result, thus, let us move ahead to in vivo studies for mouse immunization via intranasal route using PEI/pci-S complexes.",1
13,12,"A number of studies attempted to develop SARS DNA vaccines, exclusively via systemic routes including intramuscular injection [19]. As SARS is a respiratory pathogen, among the SARS vaccine candidates, targeting intranasal immunization was likely to be more effective to induce protective immune responses against infection when compared with other delivery routes. Intranasal immunization of PEI/pci-S complexes induced higher antigen-specific serum IgG responses than pci-S alone. Coincidently, antigen-specific IgG1 was also dramatically increased when compared to IgG2a, suggesting Th2 dominant response. Also the immunization enhanced antigen-specific IgA response in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and B cell proliferation after in vitro re-stimulation with the spike protein. In Garzon’s study, antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses have been dose-dependently increased in mice immunized with DNA vaccine up to 100 μg [20]. However, in our study each mouse was immunized with only 20 μg of DNA. Despite the small amount of DNA, it has induced not only systemic but also mucosal immune responses.",1
13,13,"DCs play a pivotal role for the effective induction of antigen-specific immune responses. DCs are found throughout the body and are considered as one of the first-line sentinel cells [21]. When DCs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns from microorganisms, DCs became mature and acquired capacity for the antigen presentation, concomitantly augmented the expression of MHC proteins [22], cytokines [23] and number of co-stimulatory molecules including CD80, CD83, and CD86 [24]. Thus, the maturation of DCs is essential for appropriate initiation of the subsequent adaptive immune responses [22]. In the present study, we demonstrated that the PEI/pci-S complexes increase the co-stimulatory and MHC class II molecules on DCs from cervical lymph nodes after intranasal immunization.",1
13,14,"The cellular immune responses are mediated by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Functional study indicated that antigen-specific T cells produce cytokines including IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-2, and IL-17 after in vitro re-stimulation with SARS spike peptides. IFN-g is an effector cytokine, critical for activating macrophages and DCs and inhibiting viral infection [25]. TNF-a is a cytokine that probably regulates immune cells and inhibits viral replication [26]. IL-2 mediates the expansion of T cells and maintains memory T cells [27]. IL-17 mediates the production of antimicrobial peptide and immunoglobulin for neutralizing viral infection [28]. In the current study, we have shown that antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreted IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-2, and IL-17 in nonlymphoid tissues such as lung. Furthermore multiplecytokine producing cells are increased in mice immunized i.n. with PEI/pci-S. It is probable that these cells are likely responsible for the protection when host is infected with SARS-CoV after the vaccination. In fact, it has been suggested that multi-cytokine producing antigen-specific CD4+ T cells are functionally superior on protection to single-cytokine producing cells [29]. There are several reports that multi-cytokine producing T cells have shown to correlate with protection against Leishmania major infection [30].",1
13,15,"PEI is effective in delivering DNA onto the mucosal surface, in maturation of dendritic cells and in improving the immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine. Our results indicated that PEI can be used as a vector for the mucosal delivery of DNA vaccine and play an important role in B cell and T cell immunities.",1
13,16,"The gene encoding SARS-CoV spike (S) protein without transmembrane domain (amino acids 14-1154) was synthesized. The sequence was codon optimized for mammalian cell expression and the natural signal sequence was replaced with the leader sequence of human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).

The degree of expression was detected using flow cytometry, FACSCalibur. All cytometric data were expressed as MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) and analyzed by using FlowJo software.",1
13,26,"Lungs, removed from mice on day 6 after the last vaccination, were disrupted into single-cell suspensions. The cells were seeded onto 96-well plate at 2 × 10^5 cells per well and re-stimulated with SARS peptide (Peptron) at 5 μg/ml for 12 hrs. Intracellular cytokine staining assay was followed by the manufacturer’s instruction. The cells were stained with anti-CD4-PerCP and anti-CD8FITC together with anti-IFN-g-APC and -IL-17-PE, or anti-TNF-a-APC and -IL-2-PE (all from BD Biosciences). The percentage of cells with associated fluorescence was determined by using a flow cytometry, FACSCalibur. All cytometric data were analyzed by using FlowJo software.",1
13,27,Statistical tests were performed by using Student’s t test. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.,1
