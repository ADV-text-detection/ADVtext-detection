14,1,"The prognostic assessment of breast cancer is based on factors that determine a patient’s relapse risk, and together with predictive factors (e.g., estrogen-receptor status), it is used to make optimal therapeutic decisions regarding adjuvant systemic therapy [1]. Such decisions provide a balance between the potential benefit and associated costs and side effects of treatment [1]. Therefore, it is necessary to have sensitive and specific prognosticators to accurately define risk category for breast cancer.",1
14,2,"Currently, the most significant prognosticator for women with breast cancer is axillary lymph node status [1-4]. For node-positive patients, there is a direct relationship between the number of involved axillary nodes and the risk for distant recurrence [4]. However, despite the usefulness of lymph node status, recommendations for systemic adjuvant chemotherapy are not entirely straightforward. For example, five-year survival rates show that approximately 15% of all node-negative patients with larger tumor sizes (>1 cm) may benefit from systemic adjuvant therapy, but about 85% would survive without it [5]. Furthermore, approximately onethird of node-positive patients are free of recurrence after local-regional therapy [6-8].",1
14,3,"Other major prognostic risk factors, especially for node-negative patients, are tumor size and histological tumor grade [1-4,9,10]. For node-negative patients, tumor size is a powerful prognostic factor that is used routinely to make adjuvant treatment decisions [6,11], and tumor grade is primarily used to make decisions for cases in which the tumor sizes are borderline [1,2,5]. Although tumor grade has prognostic value, significant inter-observer variation in grading still exists [12-14]. as pathologists are assessing complex histological characteristics in a semi-quantitative manner.",1
14,4,"It is known that invasive breast cancer (a malignant neoplasm) demonstrates partial or complete lack of structural organization and functional coordination with surrounding normal tissue [15]. The idea central to this study is that this loss of structural organization and functional coordination manifests itself in the form of an increase in morphologic complexity of the epithelial components at the sub-cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular levels, and the degree of this complexity can be quantified and related to patient outcome. A method that lends itself particularly useful for quantitatively characterizing complex pathological structures at different scales, is based on fractal analysis [16,17]. In this study, we assess the prognostic value of a recently developed novel technique [18] to measure the fractal dimension of segmented histological structures of breast tissue microarray (TMA) cores stained with pan-cytokeratin to highlight the morphology of epithelial architecture.",1
14,5,"A total of 408 patients with primary invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast were selected retrospectively from the Calgary Regional Hospitals after appropriate ethics approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB). It should be noted that the IRB did not require patient consent for this study as it was a retrospective study in which many of the patients were deceased and the risk of exposing patient confidentiality was extremely low. Of these, 379 patients had at least one of three TMA cores that was sufficiently stained for fractal analysis. The age range of these patients at diagnosis was 34 to 95 with a mean and median age of 65 and 66, respectfully. Stage information was available for 375 of 379 patients with the following frequency distribution: 225 (60.0%) patients were Stage I, 99 (26.4%) were Stage II, and 51 (13.6%) were Stage III. All patients selected had received adjuvant tamoxifen treatment between 1988 and 2006. Cases were identified with Alberta Cancer Board records of patients who had received tamoxifen treatment without chemotherapy. In summary, the inclusion criterion was any patient who had adequate tissue for TMA construction, and had received adjuvant tamoxifen treatment but no adjuvant chemotherapy.",1
14,6,"Whole sections stained with Hemotoxylin and Eosin (H&E) were used to select tumor areas for the TMA cores. Fourteen breast TMA blocks containing an average of 94 tissue cores were constructed from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, previously untreated breast cancer tissue. To ensure there was no selection bias, three 0.6 mm cores were chosen randomly from cancerous areas of each donor block to construct the recipient TMA core block, and the Leica RM2235 microtome (Leica Microsystems Inc.) was used to cut 4 μm thick sections from each TMA donor block. In a previous study with prostate cancer specimens, we showed that fractal analyses of specimens stained with pan-cytokeratin provide greater classification performance (benign versus high grade) than serial sections of the same specimens stained with H&E [18]. The reason for this is that pan-cytokeratin isolates and highlights the morphology of epithelial components and excludes structures that do express pathological relevance in the form of morphologic complexity (i.e., connective tissue components). Hence, we stained all the TMA sections with pancytokeratin. This staining was performed using Ventana Benchmark LT. Protease 1 antigen retrieval was used followed by Ventana pre-diluted pan-cytokeratin (cat. No. 760-2135) antibody with an incubation time of 32 minutes.",1
14,7,"Microscopic images of the TMA cores were acquired with an AxioCam HR digital camera (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) mounted on an optical microscope (Zeiss Axioscope) at a magnification of 10 × objective. The AxioCam HR has pixels of size 6.7 μm × 6.7 μm, which are 1.06 μm × 1.06 μm in apparent size at the combined magnifications of 10 × objective and 0.63 × C-mount optical coupling (optical interface between the microscope and digital camera). The images were taken at the camera’s native resolution of 1300 × 1030 pixels, and saved in tagged image file format (tif).",1
14,8,"Unlike our intuitive notion of dimension (i.e., topological dimension), fractal dimension can be a non-integer value, and the greater the morphologic complexity of an object, the higher its fractal dimension relative to its topological dimension (Figure 1). Fractal dimension quantifies the level of structural complexity by assessing the variation in the level of detail in a structure as the structure is examined at different scales [19]. Hence, it lends itself naturally to characterizing irregular structures that maintain a constant level of complexity over a range of scales.",1
14,9,"In this study, we applied an automated fractal analysis technique we developed in previous work [18] to quantify the morphologic complexity of breast epithelium, a pathologically relevant histological feature. In summary, this technique involves the following steps:",1
14,10,"1. Application of a histological stain to tissue specimens in order to highlight and isolate the histological structures of interest. In this case, these structures include the outlines of the epithelial components comprising the multi-cellular structures (gland formations), cellular structures (individual cell shapes), and sub-cellular structures (distribution of keratin within the cells and nuclear shape).",1
14,11,"2. Image acquisition and background correction of stained specimens. The background correction was done by acquiring a “blank” image (under the same imaging conditions used to acquire the TMA images), and using this “blank” image to subtract the non-uniform background luminance [18]. The resulting background corrected images are converted to grey-scale (Figure 2).",1
14,12,3. Application of a series of intensity thresholds to convert the grey-scale version of the image specimen into a series of binary images from which histological morphology outlines are derived (Figure 2). Figure 3 shows a sample magnified region of Figure 2A to illustrate the segmented morphology outlines in more detail.,1
14,13,4. Application of the box counting method [19] (with appropriate spatial scale range - 10 to 50 μm) [20] to compute the fractal dimension of each outline image obtained from step 3.,1
14,14,5. Identification of the global maximum from a plot of fractal dimension versus intensity threshold. This maximum corresponds to the fractal dimension of the pathological morphology.,1
14,15,"In previous work, we showed that our method of finding the fractal dimension is independent of changes in microscope illumination setting or stain uniformity and intensity [18]. Also, it should be noted that fractal dimension is not affected by magnification as long as the field of view of the specimen image still contains the scale range of the structures of interest over which the fractal dimension was found to be constant.",1
14,16,"Our automated fractal analysis method was applied to a total of 1224 TMA cores (3 cores for each of the 408 patient samples). For each patient, the TMA core with the maximum fractal dimension was used for the statistical analysis in this study. The rationale for choosing the maximum fractal dimension from the sampled tissue cores is to reduce the possibility that the other TMA cores from a given patient contain only benign or more highly differentiated tissue. That is, it is expected that the TMA core with the maximum fractal dimension is representative of the malignant neoplasm that has deviated most from normal cellular/glandular breast morphology, and therefore it is the most probable indicator of abnormal and/or aggressive tumor growth with metastatic potential.",1
14,17,"For 379 of the 408 patients (92.9%), fractal dimension was successfully measured in at least one of the three TMA cores generated per patient, and it could not be determined for the remaining 29 patient specimens due to insufficient staining (i.e., less than half of the specimen being stained) or specimen folding. Eight of the 29 patients could not be assessed because all 3 of their TMA cores resulted in a “blank” slide. The breakdown of the number of patients for which the TMA cores were sufficiently stained for fractal analysis was as follows: 36 patients (9.5%) had one evaluable core, 105 patients (27.7%) had two evaluable cores, and 238 patients (62.8%) had three evaluable cores.",1
14,18,"For purposes of analyses, it is often useful to convert a measured variable to a categorical variable so as to place patients into graded risk strata. As the particular fractal analysis technique we developed is novel, there are no established cutpoints available. Although several methods exist to determine cutpoints, namely biological determination, data-oriented, and outcome-oriented, there is no single method or criterion to specify which approach is best. For the present analyses, we used a data-oriented approach to select two cutpoints. The first cutpoint was chosen to correspond to the upper quartile (75th percentile) of the fractal dimension data, and the second cutpoint was chosen as the median of the remaining lower threequarters of the data. Two cutpoints, rather than one, were chosen to assess whether there was a graded relationship between fractal dimension and patient prognosis.",1
14,19,Associations between categorized fractal dimension scores and clinicopathological variables were assessed for statistical significance using a chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate 10-year disease-specific and overall survival rates and the logrank test was used to compare the curves for statistical significance. Disease-specific survival was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of death from cancer or date of last follow-up. Overall survival was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of death from any cause or date of last follow-up. The above analyses were repeated using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling to assess whether any of the clinicopathological variables influenced the findings. The proportionality assumption was assessed for all covariates using Log-Minus-Log Survival Plots and none violated the assumption. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute Inc).,1
14,20,"The prognostic accuracy of fractal dimension in predicting death from breast cancer and death from any cause was quantified by the area under the curve (AUC) from a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Values of AUC range from 0.5 (chance accuracy) to 1.0 (perfect accuracy), with the following intermediate benchmarks: 0.6 (fair), 0.7 (good), 0.8 (excellent), and 0.9 (almost perfect). For the analysis, the predicted probability of outcome from a Cox regression model was considered as a continuum. The actual occurrence of outcome was used as the comparative standard.",1
14,21,"A split-sample cross-validation was performed to assess the generalizability of the results [21]. The process consisted of splitting the original sample of 379 patients into a training set of 190 patients and a validation set of 189 patients using random sampling. A regression equation was derived in the training set and the AUC between the observed and predicted response values was calculated. The regression coefficients from the training set were then used to calculate predicted values in the validation set. The AUC between these predicted values and observed values in the validation set was calculated, and is called the cross-validation coefficient. The shrinkage coefficient was calculated as the difference between the AUCs of the training and validation sets. The smaller the shrinkage coefficient, the more confidence one can have in the generalizability of the results. Although there are no clear guidelines regarding the magnitude of shrinkage, except that smaller is better, values less than 0.10 indicate a generalizable model. Given a satisfactory shrinkage coefficient, the data were combined from both sets and a final regression equation was derived based upon the entire sample.",1
14,22,"Out of 379 evaluable patients, several had missing data: 15 (9.0%) tumor grades, 4 (1.1%) lymph node status, 15 (4.0%) estrogen-receptor status, and 12 (3.2%) HER-2/neu status. Rather than excluding these patients from the analyses and reducing the sample size, missing data were imputed using the predicted mean approach in SOLAS 3.0 software (Statistical Solutions, Ltd.). Imputation bias was assessed by re-running all the analyses and excluding any patient with missing data. As the estimates were similar, the results are reported with the imputed data.",1
14,23,"Fractal dimension scores ranged from 1.08 to 1.97, with a median of 1.62, lower quartile 1.49, and upper quartile 1.75. There was moderate level of relatedness (intraclass correlation = 0.51) among the cores. Using the data-oriented approach to select two cutpoints, fractal dimension values < 1.56 were considered low (N = 141), 1.56-1.75 as intermediate (N = 148), and > 1.75 as high (N = 90). Figure 2 shows representative TMA cores from these fractal dimension categories. One can see from this figure that the classification of TMA cores into low, intermediate, and high fractal dimension categories (A-C) corresponds to the increasing complexity of outline morphology.",1
14,24,"The baseline patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Higher fractal dimension was significantly associated with traditional indicators of poor prognosis, including older age, larger tumour sizes, higher tumour grade, and positive lymph node status. However, fractal dimension was not associated with either estrogenreceptor status or HER-2/neu status.",1
14,25,"The median patient follow-up was 5.2 years. The 10-year disease-specific and overall survival rates for the entire group of 379 patients were 52.5% and 42.5%, respectively. Patients with higher fractal scores had significantly worse disease-specific survival than those with lower scores (25.0% versus 56.4% versus 69.4%, p < 0.001; Table 2 and Figure 4A). As well, patients with higher scores had significantly worse overall survival (14.2% versus 39.9% versus 67.4%, p < 0.001; Table 2 and Figure 4B). The AUCs for fractal dimension were 0.66 and 0.67 for univariate disease-specific and overall survival, respectively, indicating good levels of prognostic accuracy. As expected, older age, higher grade, and positive lymph node status were significantly predictive of worse outcome, but not the size of the tumour, estrogen-receptor status, or HER-2/neu status (Table 2).",1
14,26,"Tumour grade was derived from the original pathology reports that included between 10 and 30 board-certified cancer pathologists. In contrast to the distinct separation of the disease-specific survival curves for the different fractal dimension categories (Figure 4A), the disease-specific survival curves for grade 1 and 2 tumours virtually overlaped each other over the entire 10-year follow-up period (Figure 4C). Also, there is virtual overlap in the overall survival curves of tumour grades 1 and 2 for the first 4-year period (Figure 4D). These results suggest that tumour grades 1 and 2 do not discriminate patients with respect to 10-year outcome.",1
14,27,"Results from Cox proportional hazards regression showed that fractal dimension remained statistically significant even after adjusting for all clinicopathological variables (Table 3). This result implies that fractal dimension is a strong prognostic factor, even though the multivariate hazard ratio (Table 3) is smaller than the univariate hazard ratio (Table 2). The AUCs for the 7factor regression models were 0.73 and 0.75 for diseasespecific and overall survival, respectively. These AUCs increased by only 0.07 and 0.08 when six clinical-pathological factors were added to fractal dimension in the multivariate regression model. The small increase in AUCs incidate that the other clinical-pathological factors contribute little to the prognostic accuracy beyond fractal dimension. It is also worth noting that even with the comparison of grades 1 and 2 as one category versus grade 3 tumours, both disease-specific and overall survival were more strongly and significantly associated with fractal dimension than tumour grade.",1
14,28,"The generalizability of the aforementioned results was assessed by split-sample cross-validation as described in the statistical analysis section. The results, shown in Table 4 are congruent, not only with each set but also with the results of the entire sample shown in Tables 2 and 3. Specifically, the frequency distribution of low, moderate, and high fractal dimension is similar, as are the 10-year disease-specific and overall survival rates in these three categories. Even with smaller sample sizes, both the training and validation sets still show a pattern of doubling of hazards with higher levels of fractal dimension. The shrinkage coefficients for disease-specific and overall survival were -0.01 and -0.05, respectively, both indicating that fractal dimension is generalizable and that combining data from both sets in the analyses was justified.",1
14,29,"We previously developed a fractal analysis method to quantitatively measure the morphologic complexity of epithelial architecture [18], and showed a direct association between fractal dimension and breast tumour grade, suggesting that it may be a good surrogate measure of tumour differentiation [22]. In this study we examined the prognostic value of fractal dimension by analyzing 379 specimens from patients with invasive breast cancer, and found that with the exception of nodal status, fractal dimension showed a stronger association with disease-specific survival than standard clinical prognosticators. The potential clinical implications of these results are substantial because to our knowledge, this is the largest and only study of its kind investigating and demonstrating a positive association between the morphologic complexity of breast epithelial architecture (via the fractal dimension metric) and patient outcome. The potential advantages of fractal dimension over conventional tumour grading is that it is a quantitative and reproducible indicator that would be able to provide pathologists with rapid and cost effective high volume analysis from as few as three tissue microarray (TMA) cores per patient.",1
14,30,"Ideally, a study investigating the value of a potential prognosticator should only involve patients that have not received any form of adjuvant systemic therapy. However, as noted by Mirza et al. [5], such studies are becoming increasingly difficult to perform because systemic therapy is recommended for an ever-widening range of breast cancer patients. Although none of the patients in this study were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, they were all treated with adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, including the 24 ER-negative patients (note: cases selected for this study where from as far back as 1988 when tamoxifen was occasionally administered to patients with ER-negative tumours). However, even though the patients received a form of adjuvant systemic therapy, the same form of treatment was received by all of the patients leading to the expectation that fractal dimension will be independent of the predictive factor related to tamoxifen therapy (i. e., ER-positive status). Indeed, this appears to be the case, since approximately the same percentage of ERpositive patients are in the low, intermediate, and high fractal dimension groups (Table 1), which likely indicates that tamoxifen therapy has put all of these ERpositive patients on an equal footing.",1
14,31,"Previous studies have examined the application of fractal analysis for characterizing cancer [23,24] and have shown that fractal dimension can describe the complex pathological structures seen in some cancers; [18,22] however, to our knowledge, our results represent the largest and sole study relating fractal dimension of epithelial architecture to patient outcome. Although we did not use an external patient validation set in this proof of principle study, we employed a data-oriented approach to minimize bias in the selection of cutpoints, as well as, conducting a split-sample cross-validation analysis. This analysis suggests that the results are generalizable, whereby higher fractal dimensions are associated with poorer outcome. This observation demonstrates the high potential of fractal dimension as an image-based prognostic marker, and it is congruent with the notion that malignant breast neoplasms associated with poorer outcome demonstrate partial or complete lack of structural organization and functional coordination with surrounding normal tissue [15]. Furthermore, it implies that changes in the morphologic complexity of architectural components of the neoplasm (i.e., the epithelium) that arise from changes in the functional status of cells in malignant neoplasms can be quantified with fractal analysis.",1
14,32,"In summary, the results of this retrospective study show that fractal dimension is a promising image analysis marker for the prognosis of IDC of the breast. However, its’ prognostic value needs to be confirmed in external validation studies, and ultimately in the context of controlled prospective clinical trials. As a step in this direction, in future work, we will investigate the prognostic value of fractal dimension for defining risk category for Stage I (i.e., lymph node-negative and tumour size ≤ 2 cm in maximum diameter), IDC, ER-positive breast cancer patients that have not received any form of adjuvant systemic therapy. Such a study would be especially valuable because in current clinical practice it is still difficult to identify this subgroup of patients that would benefit most from adjuvant chemotherapy. Also, in future work we will investigate the prognostic and predictive value of combining fractal dimension, a morphological index, with a quantitative analysis of mitotic count, which is a cellular proliferation index that has been shown to be a significant prognostic indicator for node-negative breast cancer [5]. These investigations would provide validation of the significance of morphologic complexity of epithelial architecture in node-negative breast cancer, and explore the possible synergy between morphologic complexity and cellular proliferation.",1
16,1,"Tooth loss, one of the indicators of periodontal disease [1,2], has been reported to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia [3,4]. Individuals with clinical dementia have an increased deterioration of their dental health [5], and tooth loss may induce nutritional deficits [6]. Reductions in the number of pyramidal cells [7] and acetylcholine levels [8] in the hippocampus due to the decrease of masticatory function caused by molar loss have been found in animal models. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized [9] that periodontal disease-derived inflammatory molecules, bacteria, and bacterial products enhance brain inflammation [10,11].",1
16,2,"Among individuals with mild memory impairment (MMI), 21.2% progressed to illnesses with dementia, including AD (10.6%), vascular dementia (4.8%), or other types of dementia (5.8%), over a period of 5 years [12]; therefore, they represent a high-risk population for dementia. MMI was defined as [13]: (1) no impairment of the activities of daily living (ADL); (2) normal general cognitive function, as determined by a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≥ 24 [14]; (3) objective memory impairment, assessed by the MMSE three-word delayed recall test (Recall test) (low score: 1 or 0); and (4) absence of dementia or depression, diagnosed by geriatric neuropsychiatrists according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3 rd edn., revised (DSM-III R) criteria [15].",1
16,3,"We hypothesized that tooth loss may also be associated with the preclinical stage of AD and dementia. To investigate our hypothesis in a community-based survey, subjects with MMI or a low MMSE score (23 or lower) [16] and elderly controls were identified operationally by using the MMSE and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) short version [17]. Data on the number of remaining teeth, the length of the edentulous period, health-related lifestyles, and medical history were collected. Blood pressure, height, and body weight were measured, and fasting venous blood samples were also obtained. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to compare the number of remaining teeth and the length of the edentulous period in subjects with MMI or a low MMSE score with those in elderly controls.",1
16,4,This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Nara Medical University. Written informed consent was obtained from each of the subjects prior to their participation in the study.,1
16,5,"We used data from the baseline examination of the Fujiwara-kyo study, a study of successful aging in the elderly. The subjects were volunteer men and women aged 65 years or older from Nara prefecture (where the first capital of Japan, called “Fujiwara-kyo,” was established), who were living in their own homes and able to walk independently. A total of 4,206 individuals gave their written consent for participation in the study and completed the baseline examination in 2007-2008.",1
16,6,"The MMSE (score range, 0-30) is used as a screening test for cognitive impairment. The Recall test (score range, 0-3) is a sub-item of the MMSE that evaluates the impairment of recent memory. Subjects were instructed to recall three unrelated objects that they were previously instructed to remember. The MMSE was carried out by clinical psychologists or interviewers who majored in psychology in graduate schools and were formally trained by a psychiatrist.",1
16,7,"Depression was evaluated using the GDS (score range, 0-15; cut-off score, 5/6). Responses were coded as follows: 1 = yes, symptom present; 0 = no, symptom not present. The scores for the individual items were summed to obtain the final score, where higher scores indicated a greater number of depressive symptoms. The GDS was included in a self-administered questionnaire survey.",1
16,8,"A dental examination was carried out by two dentists calibrated as to the techniques, with the dentist and the subject in a sitting position under artificial lighting. The number of teeth was recorded for each subject. The remaining teeth were defined as healthy, carious, or treated teeth (including crowned, inlay, and abutment teeth for bridge work), inclusive of completely erupted third molars. Root tips and very loose teeth that were indicated for extraction were not included as remaining teeth. The age at which edentulous individuals had lost all of their teeth was also recorded. The Community Periodontal Index (CPI) code [18] was recorded. The upper and lower teeth were divided into six prescribed segments, and each segment was subjected to further examination if it contained two or more remaining teeth that did not require extraction. The prescribed 10 representative teeth in the 6 segments (tooth position: 11, 16, 17, 26, 27, 31, 36, 37, 46, and 47) were examined. Each segment was assigned to one of five code levels (code 0, healthy; code 1, gingival bleeding after probing; code 2, calculus present in the periodontal pocket; code 3, periodontal pocket 4-5 mm deep; and code 4, periodontal pocket at least 6 mm deep), or an ineligible segment (a segment with one or no remaining teeth).",1
16,9,"The subjects were asked about their drinking frequency (hardly drink; drink on at least 1 day a week), the type of alcohol they drank, their average daily alcohol intake, their smoking habits (never; ex-smoker; current smoker), and the time spent walking every day on average (less than 30 minutes; 30 minutes or more) in a self-administered questionnaire that was confirmed by interview. Each subject was interviewed to record the presence or absence of severe visual and hearing impairment, impairment of the basic (eating, dressing, bathing, toileting, and walking) and instrumental (use public transportation, shop for daily necessities, pay bills, and handle one’s own banking) ADL, and any history of disease (cancer, cerebrovascular disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension). After sitting quietly for more than 5 min, their blood pressure was determined twice at an interval of 30 s using an automatic blood-pressure manometer (ES-P2100; TERUMO Co., Tokyo, Japan) that displayed the values determined by the Korotkoff method.",1
16,10,"Examinations of the differences between the control and MMI groups, and between the control and low MMSE score groups were performed at the level of significance set for multiple comparisons based on the Bonferroni test, after the chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests were used. A trend test to detect the increased prevalence of MMI or a low MMSE score status according to the number of remaining teeth and CPI was performed using the Mantel-extension method [19]. Logistic regression analysis (by the forced entry method) was carried out with MMI and a low MMSE score as dependent variables. Depressive symptoms, sex, age, length of education, and other variables were used as independent variables. The number of remaining teeth and the length of time after the subjects became edentulous were used as continuous variables in one model and categorical variables in the other model. Goodness of fit was performed based on the technique of Hosmer and Lemeshow [20]. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 17.0; SPSS Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan). We calculated two-tailed P values in all of the analyses. The a level of significance was set at 0.05.",1

The 3,847 subjects with high MMSE scores (24 or more) were revealed by interviews to be able to independently execute the basic and instrumental ADL. They were classified on the basis of their Recall score into the control group (high score: 3 or 2) (n = 3,696) or the low score group (score: 1 or 0) (n = 151). We excluded 30 subjects from the low score group who were suspected of having depression based on their high scores in the GDS (score: 6 or more) due to the likelihood of pseudo-dementia induced by depressive symptoms. Finally, the control (n = 3,696), MMI (n = 121), and low MMSE score (n = 214) groups were included for analysis in this crosssectional study.",1

The factors showing statistically significant differences by the Bonferroni test between the control and MMI groups or between the control and low MMSE score groups were depressive symptoms, age, sex, length of education, the number of remaining teeth, drinking alcohol at least one day a week, smoking, time spent walking every day, and the levels of serum albumin, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.",1
16,13,"Figure 2 shows the prevalence of MMI or a low MMSE score. The number of remaining teeth (range: 0-32) was categorized into 3 equal categories (22-32, 11-21, and 0-10 teeth). No significant dose-response relationship was found in a trend test between the number of remaining teeth and the prevalence of MMI in the 65-74 years or 75 years or more categories, although the prevalence of MMI was higher in subjects with 0-10 remaining teeth than in those with 22-32 remaining teeth. The prevalence of a low MMSE score was 2.7% in subjects with 22-32 remaining teeth, 5.0% in those with 11-21 remaining teeth, and 6.8% in those with 0-10 remaining teeth in the 65-74 years category, and 4.0%, 8.0%, and 11.0% in the 75 years or more category, respectively. Significant increases in prevalence were found in a trend test in both age categories (P < 0.001) (upper panel, Figure 2).

After the variables in the full models were adjusted, we observed significant relationships between the number of remaining teeth (per 1 decrease) to MMI (odds ratio: 1.021, 95% CI: 1.001-1.041) and a low MMSE score (odds ratio: 1.039, 95% CI: 1.0231.054). Furthermore, the odds ratio of 0-10 remaining teeth to 22-32 remaining teeth was 1.679 (95% CI: 1.073-2.627) for MMI and 2.177 (95% CI: 1.510-3.140) for a low MMSE score.",1
16,15,"Among edentulous subjects (control, n = 323; MMI, n = 18; low MMSE score, n = 47), the median age (25 th percentile, 75 th percentile) at which they became edentulous and the prevalence of individuals who were edentulous for 15 years or more was 62.8 years (60.0, 68.0) and 34.4% in the control group, 62.5 years (59.8, 65.0) and 50.0% in the MMI group, and 60.0 years (57.0, 65.0) and 59.6% in the low MMSE score group, respectively, demonstrating significant differences by the Bonferroni test between the control and low MMSE score groups (data not shown). After multiple variables were adjusted (Table 3), the odds ratios of “per 1 year increase” and “15 years or more” for a low MMSE score were 1.058 (95% CI 1.014-1.103) and 3.102 (95% CI 1.432-6.720), respectively.",1
16,16,"This community-based survey revealed that the prevalence of a low MMSE score was significantly increased in association with the decrease in the number of remaining teeth (Figure 2). After adjustment for other explanatory variables (Table 2), a significant relationship between the decrease in the number of remaining teeth and a low MMSE score was observed. These results are consistent with those of previous reports demonstrating that tooth loss was associated with decreased cognitive function [21,22]. We also revealed that a decrease in the number of remaining teeth was associated with the risk of MMI.",1
16,17,"Four limitations of the present study merit consideration. The principal limitation was that the data were derived from a cross-sectional study; thus, we can only hypothesize for the biological credibility of the effect of tooth loss on MMI and a low MMSE score. Second, we did not investigate when tooth loss started or its causes. We also did not investigate markers of inflammation in the gingival crevicular fluid or alveolar bone loss measurements, by which the severity of periodontal disease can be evaluated more precisely than with the CPI code. Third, our criteria for identifying subjects with MMI were different from Ishikawa’s criteria [13] as we identified the absence of dementia or depression using the MMSE and GDS screening tests; however, the prevalence of MMI in our study (2.9%: 121/4,206) was similar to the prevalence of Japanese community-based mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [23,24] identified using the criteria of Petersen et al. [25]. Therefore, the MMI subjects in this study are considered to approximate individuals with MCI. Fourth, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping was not examined. Individuals with dementia had a higher frequency of APOE ε4 compared with nondemented individuals in Japanese-American men [26].",1
16,18,"The basis of the relationship between tooth loss and a low MMSE score was considered as given below. Older adults with a low MMSE score do not regularly use dental services [27]. In addition, older adults with dementia have increased plaque accumulation [5]. There may be other biological bases separate from the deterioration of dental health induced by cognitive impairment among tooth loss, MMI, and a low MMSE score, considering that a significant relationship was also found between tooth loss and MMI subjects who maintained the basic and instrumental ADL.",1
16,19,"Four further plausible biological explanations for the relationship between tooth loss and cognitive function can be proposed. First, periodontal disease, which is the cause of approximately 50% of all extractions in the elderly [28], may be associated with cognitive function through systemic inflammation. It has been hypothesized that inflammatory cytokines induced by periodontal disease can enter or influence the brain [9,29]. Second, genetic risk factors related to periodontal disease and cognitive function may be present; an interleukin 1 gene polymorphism has been reported to be associated with the severity of periodontal disease [30] and the risk of AD [31]. Third, a decrease in the number of periodontal mechanoreceptors due to tooth loss [32], which are sensory receptors, may result in a memory learning disorder. The functional deterioration of the cholinergic neuronal system in the parietal cortex has been observed in molar-loss rats [33]. In addition, the number of high-affinity tyrosine kinase B mRNA-positive cells in the hippocampal CA3 area was negatively affected by the duration of tooth loss and the number of teeth extracted [7]. However, these findings are based on animal models, and further investigations will be needed.",1
16,20,"Among edentulous subjects, a significant relationship was found between the length of the edentulous period and the risk of a low MMSE score after adjustment for their age at the baseline examination and other variables (Table 3). A history of “lost all teeth or lost half of teeth before age 35” was a significant risk factor for AD [3]. We observed a higher prevalence of individuals who were edentulous for 15 years or more in the MMI group (50.0%) than in the control group (34.4%), although no significant relationship was found; therefore, tooth loss may have a cumulative detrimental effect on the brain.",1
16,21,"While there was a significant relationship between the number of remaining teeth with the risk of MMI and a low MMSE score, no significant relationship was found between the CPI code, MMI, and a low MMSE score (Table 1 and Figure 2). The CPI is a marker of the current status of periodontal tissue, and it appears to underestimate the relationship between cognitive function and the cumulative burden of periodontal disease. We consider that tooth loss or periodontal disease may be associated with cognitive function because the prevalence of “Ineligible for CPI” was higher and the prevalence of “Code 0, 1, or 2” was lower in the MMI and low MMSE score groups than in the control group.",1
16,22,"Significant relationships were found between the number of remaining teeth, the length of the edentulous period, and cognitive function. Within the limitation of no APOE genotyping data, this cross-sectional study suggests a significant relationship of tooth loss to MMI and cognitive impairment. Further studies are needed to investigate the specific causes of this relationship.",1
18,1,"Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women and poses a threat to women’s health. Al-Hajj’s research in 2003 has shown that breast cancer stem cells (ESA+CD44+CD24-/low, BCSCs) possessing the stem cell properties of self-renewal and multi-directional differentiation are the most fundamental contributors to drug resistance, recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer [1]. Previous studies in both breast cancer cells and tissues have shown that breast cancer stem cells are cells with an ESA+CD44+CD24-/low phenotype [2,3]. We based this study on the previous findings on breast cancer stem cell phenotype and finally proved it. Research focusing on BCSCs is likely to bring revolutionary changes to our understanding of breast cancer; however, a multitude of unresolved issues remain with regard to the molecular basis of carcinogenesis. For example, what is the full nature of the involvement of BCSCs in the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis? Are microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in the function of BCSCs? If so, how are they involved?",1
18,2,"As an important class of regulatory noncoding RNAs, miRNAs have been shown to play important roles in the committed differentiation and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells [4]. The current release (10.0) of miRBase contains 5071 miRNA loci from 58 species [5]. miRNAs can act as oncogenes or anti-oncogenes and are involved in tumorigenesis, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, paediatric Burkitt’s lymphoma, gastric cancer, lung cancer and large-cell lymphoma [6-8]. In Homo sapiens, miRNAs (1048 sequences in miRBase 16, Sep 10th, 2010) regulate more than one-third of all genes, bringing hope to studies of cancer stem cells http://www.mirbase.org/. Thus, the identification of cancer stem cell-related miRNAs would provide valuable information for a better understanding of cancer stem cell properties and even the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated the miRNA expression profiles of ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/low BCSCs from the MCF-7 cell line.",1
18,3,"The human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen, America). Cells in log phase were digested with 0.25% trypsin (Gibco, America) and washed with PBS, then stained with FITC-conjugated anti-ESA, APC-conjugated antiCD44 and PE-conjugated anti-CD24 (BD PharMingen, America). After 30 min incubation, the cells were washed three times, and FACS (MoFlo, America) was performed to isolate the ESA+CD44+CD24-/low cells.",1
18,4,"The isolated ESA+CD44+CD24-/low lineage- cells were suspended in MEM supplemented with 1% FBS and washed twice with the same medium. The medium was then replaced with EpiCult™-B medium (Stemcell technologies, Canada) supplemented with 5% FBS. Subsequently, 1 × 10^4 BCSCs were seeded onto 2 × 10^4 irradiated NIH/3T3 feeder cells in 24-well plates. The mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line NIH/3T3 was cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen). As feeder layer cells, NIH/3T3 cells in log phase were exposed to 60 Co at 50 Gy. The medium was replaced again with serum-free EpiCult™-B medium at 24 hr after seeding, and the cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37°C. The cells were supplied with fresh medium every 3 days, and colonies were observed under a microscope after 7-10 days.",1
18,5,"Eight-week-old female NOD/SCID mice were given 2.5 Gy of 60Co radiation, and tumor cell injections were performed 1 day after irradiation. The tumor cells were suspended in 0.2 ml of IMDM containing 10% FBS and injected into the mammary fat pad at the left armpit. The mice in the test group were injected with 0.5 × 10^3, 1 × 10^3, 5 × 10^3, 1 × 10^4 or 5 × 10^4 ESA+CD44+CD24-/low cells isolated by FACS, whereas the mice in the control group were injected with 1 × 10^4, 5 × 10^4, 1 × 10^5, 5 × 10^5 or 1 × 10^6 MCF-7 cells. Three mice in each group were inoculated with the same amount of cells. The mice were observed for tumor growth every 10 days over 8 weeks and then sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Single cell suspensions were obtained according to our previously published protocol [9]. Subsequently, ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/low cells were isolated from the xenograft tumor cells by FACS and injected into the mammary fat pad as described above. All animal procedures were carried out with the approval of the Animal Ethics Committee of the Third Military Medical University.",1
18,6,"Tumor tissue slides were prepared for immunohistochemistry. Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and smooth muscle actin (SMA), markers of luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells, respectively, were used for immunostaining according to our previously published protocol [9]. Rabbit polyclonal anti-EMA or anti-SMA antibodies (dilution 1:500; Santa Cruz, CA) were used.",1
18,7,"Both miRNA microarray fabrication and hybridisation were performed as described previously [9]. Our miRNA microarray included 517 mature miRNA sequences and 122 published predicted miRNA (Pred_miR) sequences [10]. For each sample, two hybridisations were carried out, and each miRNA probe had three replicate spots on the microarray. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM, version 2.1) was performed using a two classunpaired comparison in the SAM procedure.",1

18,10,"The expression of ESA, CD44 and CD24 in MCF-7 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. A 1-2% frequency of ESA+ CD44 + CD24 -/low lineage- cells was observed, and the cells were isolated by flow cytometry (Figure 1A). Using FACS sorting, this subpopulation of cells was highly purified (98-99% purity). To assess the clonogenic potential of these BCSCs, the cells were seeded into 24-well plates on top of irradiated NIH/3T3 feeder cells. At day 3, the number of adherent cells increased, and three to five epithelioid colonies formed. At day 6, the colonies continued to expand and spread stereoscopically. After 10 days in culture, most of the colonies contained more than 50 cells and were surrounded by floating or dead NIH/3T3 cells. Under an inverted phase contrast microscope, the ESA+ CD44+ CD24-/low cells were observed to grow into globular colonies (Figure 1B). These cells showed no special morphological changes, however, compared with MCF-7 cells.",1
18,11,"We injected isolated ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/low cells and MCF-7 cells (as a control) subcutaneously into the armpits of NOD/SCID mice. After 8 weeks, the MCF-7 cells gave rise to new tumors when ≥5 × 10^5 cells were injected but failed to do so at lower doses (1 × 10^5 cells). In contrast, the ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/low cells formed tumors in three of three, three of three and one of three animals when 5 × 10^4 , 1 × 10^4 , and 5 × 10^3 cells were injected, respectively. Tumor specimens were retrieved and subsequently passaged into recipient mice. At 8 weeks after inoculation, three of three, three of three, and two of three recipient animals formed tumors when 5 × 104, 1 × 104 and 5 × 103 cells were injected, respectively. Tumors were also observed in one of three animals in the control group when 5 × 105 cells were injected; however, 5 × 104 -1 × 105 cells failed to form tumors in the control group (Table 1 Figure 1C). These data indicate that ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/low cells are tumorigenic and have up to 100- to 1000-fold greater tumor-initiating capability than MCF-7 cells.",1
18,12,"In addition, we tested ESA+CD44+/CD24- subpopulation variability in the murine model by FACS analysis. ESA+CD44+/CD24- subpopulation in unsorted MCF-7 xenografts remained to be 1-2%, showing little change. By contrast, ESA+CD44+/CD24- subpopulation in sorted MCF-7 xenografts were significantly enriched to 4-5%.",1
18,13,"Tumor tissue slides were prepared for H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining. The tumors in the BCSCs group were positive for both EMA and SMA, indicating that they were included of both luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. On the other hand, the tumors in the MCF-7 control group were positive for EMA, but negative for SMA, indicating that they were included of luminal epithelial cells, but not myoepithelial cells (Figure 2).",1
18,14,"For each cell type, the hybridisation reaction was repeated twice. The internal control U6 snRNA spots on all of the microarrays showed consistent signal strength, and the signal intensity of all of the detected spots on the replicate microarrays indicated high correlation coefficients (R = 0.9747 ± 0.0304), highlighting the reproducibility of hybridisation between the replicate microarrays(Additional file 1 Figure S1). There were 147 miRNAs in the MCF-7 cells and 102 miRNAs in the BCSCs, including predicted miRNAs (PRED_MIR), which gave a signal value above 800. The previously reported miRNA expression profile of MCF-7 cells (Ambion, USA) included 41 miRNAs (signal value ≥++). Among those miRNAs, 34 were also detected in our study, indicating a concordance rate of 82.9% (Additional file 1Table S1 S2 & S3). We compared the miRNA expression profiles of BCSCs and MCF-7 cells using a normalisation factor and clustering. A miRNA was defined as differentially expressed when a value of p < 0.05 was obtained. We identified 25 differentially expressed miRNAs that fell into two groups (fold change ≥ 4).",1
18,15,"We performed real-time RT-PCR for 10 miRNAs: miR122a, miR-188, miR-200a, miR-21, miR-224, miR-296, miR-301, miR-31, miR-373* and miR-200C. As a negative control, miR-200C did not show obvious difference in our study. The experiments were repeated three times each. Eight of the ten miRNAs tested gave realtime RT-PCR results that were concordant with the microarray data, with miR-296 being the only exception, indicating a concordance rate of 88.89%. The electrophoretogram showed clear and specific bands for all of the real-time RT-PCR reactions, and all the amplification curves in the PCR reactions were distinct (Figure 3A). Part of amplification curves for miR-188, miR-200a miR301 and miR-31 are shown in Figure 3B. The Q-RT-PCR results for the 10 miRNAs tested were 6.344 ± 0.402, 0.226 ± 0.513, 0.086 ± 0.514, 0.071 ± 0.503, 14.175 ± 2.033, 0.334 ± 0.587, 0.066 ± 1.008, 2.816 ± 0.328, 6.684 ± 0.548 and 0.345 ± 0.531 (expressed as the relative ratio between the Q-RT-PCR results for BCSCs and MCF-7 cells ± standard deviation). Despite little difference in the microarray results, the expression of miR-200c was found to be no more than three times lower in BCSCs than in MCF-7 (Figure 3CTable 2). Thus, the miRNA expression profiles of the BCSCs were confirmed by Q-RT-PCR.",1
18,16,"Chromosome localisation, sequence analysis and target prediction of the miRNAs were carried out using online software programs. Potential tumorigenesis-related miRNAs and their possible targets were analysed. Most of these targets were oncogenes, anti-oncogenes or regulatory genes involved in miRNA processing, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, apoptosis regulation and stem cell function and maintenance, etc. For example, there were 161 potential targets of miR122a, including RAD21, G3BP2, CDC42BPB, SP2, GPR172B, GPR172A, MAP3K3, DR1, KHDRBS1, MAP3K12, CCNG1 and DICER1. These potential targets included oncogenes, transcription factors and genes related to DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, miRNA processing and signal transduction. The gene encoding miR-21 was located on chromosome 17, and there were 175 potential targets of miR-21, including PLAG1, PDCD4, SKI, BCL2, STAT3, PITX2, HBP1, ELF2, E2F3, SPRY1, CDC25A, N-PAC, EIF1AX, EIF2C2, RAB11A, RAB6A, RAB6C, RASGRP1, RHOB, RASA1, TPM1, TGFBI and TNFSF6, which exist exclusively in humans, mice, dogs, chimps and chickens. These potential targets included pleiomorphic adenoma genes, transcription factors, oncogenes, anti-oncogenes, and genes related to miRNA processing and signal transduction (Additional file 1 table S4).",1
15,1,"In recent years, there has been a significant amount of research conducted on corticomuscular synchronization while isometrically compensating for static forces. Monkey studies have reported beta-range (15-30 Hz) corticomuscular coherence (CMC) between motor cortical neurons and muscles, while studies on humans have shown CMC between sensorimotor cortex and muscle activity (EMG). The studies mentioned range from 1 to 14 in number.",0
15,2,"Gamma-range CMC was investigated in relation to corticospinal interactions and motor tasks, with different subranges associated with different tasks. For example, 40-70 Hz CMC was correlated with readiness to respond in a simple reaction-time task, while 35-60 Hz CMC occurred mainly for submaximal and maximal forces. The high gamma subrange (61-100 Hz) showed significant ECoG-EMG coherence during phasic movements. A lower gammasubrange (30-45 Hz) reflected the integration of proprioceptive, visual, and cognitive information required for motor command in a visuomotor isometric compensation task. Gamma-range CMC was found to not be modulated by the amplitude of the modulated force, prompting the question of whether it is modulated by various frequencies.",0
15,3,"During a visuomotor task, we examined the CMC, cortical motor spectral power, and motor performance. Subjects compensated isometrically a force that was periodically modulated at 8% MVC with three frequencies, namely 0.6, 1.0 and 1.6 Hz.",0
15,4,"Based on our previous findings that the CMC shifts from beta to gamma range during compensation of static and periodically modulated force, we tested the prediction that the CMC would shift towards higher frequencies with an increase in frequency modulation. This shift was expected to facilitate the integration of sensorimotor information.",0
15,5,"Recent research has shown that when individuals perform rhythmic hand movements, there is an increase in beta-range corticomuscular coherence (CMC) which is accompanied by a peak in CMC at the frequency of the movement or muscle contraction. This led to the prediction of CMC peaks at frequencies of modulated force and the speculation of stronger low-frequency CMC peaks for more difficult tasks and higher frequencies.",0
15,6,"According to our study, the modulation of force frequencies did not affect beta- and gamma-range CMC and cortical motor spectral power during isometric compensation at 8% MVC. However, a distinct bilateral CMC peak at 1.6 Hz was observed in the five gamma-range CMC subjects. Based on this, we suggest that the frequency range of CMC is influenced by various factors such as task parameters, individual differences, and behavioral strategies.",0
15,7,The study involved 8 female participants who were all right-handed and had no prior neurological issues. Their average age was 28 with a standard deviation of 10 years. Hand dominance was determined using the Oldfield questionnaire. Three of the participants had previously taken part in comparable experiments within the same laboratory. All participants gave informed consent and followed the guidelines set out in the declaration of Helsinki as well as receiving approval from the local ethics committee.,0
15,8,The participant was situated in a room that was electrically shielded and had low lighting. They had their right arm secured by a splint and were directed to place their hand on a sphere while positioning their right index finger in the ring of a custom-made manipulator (refer to Figure 1B).,0
15,9,"The device called manipulandum was created to exert vertical forces on the finger at the metacarpophalangeal joint level. A tooth belt drive controlled by a computer generated a force that varied on the ring. The participant had to isometrically counteract the force produced by the manipulandum to keep the ring in its original position, indicated in Figure 1B. Meanwhile, the subject received visual feedback about the ring's position, displayed on a 19'' monitor 100 cm away. The screen showed two concentric circles, with the green outer one at the centre representing the reference position of the ring, and the white inner one indicating the actual position of the ring, changing as the subject adapted to the manipulandum's force. The goal was to align the white circle with the green one, which required the subject to generate a force opposite to the one applied to the ring, in this case, flexion. The sensitivity of the feedback was 2 mm on the screen for a 1 mm displacement of the ring.",0
15,10,"The force generated had four phases as shown in Figure 1D. The first phase was a ramp phase with a rising cosine function that ensured a smooth start of the force, and the force level or ramp amplitude for all experimental conditions remained constant at 8% MVC. The second phase lasted for 3 seconds and was a static force period (T0) that allowed time for stabilizing the force at the ""0"" position. The third phase was a sinusoidally modulated force period with 8% MVC peak-to-peak amplitude that lasted for 15 seconds. Finally, a downward ramp phase with a cosine function was implemented to ensure a smooth end of the generated force.",0
15,11,"The recording session investigated three experimental conditions as shown in Figure 1D. The first condition, labeled W1, had a frequency of 0.6 Hz for the force modulation (shown in the left panel). The second condition, labeled W2, had a frequency of 1 Hz for the force modulation (shown in the middle panel). The third condition, labeled W3, had a frequency of 1.6 Hz for the force modulation (shown in the right panel).",0
15,12,"The frequencies W1, W2, and W3 were chosen to be equidistant on a logarithmic scale, satisfying the relationships W2 = 5/3 × W1 and W3 = 8/5 × W2. W2 is thus approximately the geometric mean of W1 and W3, and this choice aligns with the logarithmic discrimination abilities of humans. Additionally, no single frequency overlapped with another frequency's harmonics on the frequency spectrum to minimize crosstalk. This information can be found in [28] and [29].",0
15,13,"Before the test began, we monitored the resting EEG of participants for 5 minutes while they focused on a small white circle and relaxed their right hand on a sphere with their right index finger positioned in the manipulandum's ring. The manipulandum did not apply any pressure during this resting phase, allowing the index finger to stay still in its initial position. Next, we gauged the force equal to their individual MVC. The experimental session involved five different recording series, with each series consisting of 18 trials. The experimental conditions (W1, W2, W3) were presented in a pseudo-random order within each set of 18 trials, ensuring that each frequency was featured six times in one recording series. Consequently, each subject completed a total of 30 trials for each of the three frequency conditions. To prevent muscle fatigue, we included rest periods of 7 to 12 seconds between trials and about 5 minutes between series.",0
15,14,"The subjects were instructed to focus on the time pattern of the applied force and adjust their finger muscle contraction accordingly in order to maintain consistent performance and avoid distractions during trials. They were then asked to verbally identify the force frequency as either slow, middle, or fast, corresponding to 0.6 Hz (W1), 1 Hz (W2), and 1.6 Hz (W3) after each trial.",0
15,15,"The participants were directed to refrain from making any other movements and to focus on the concentric circles exhibited on the monitor. Prior to the beginning of the recordings, the participants underwent some trials to acquaint themselves with the assignment.",0
15,16,"The international 10-10 system was used to record electrical potentials from 58 scalp positions at a bandpass of 0-200 Hz and a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The reference was set to Cz, with the ground at FzA, and electrode impedances were kept under 5 kOhm. To exclude trials contaminated with eye movements, the electrooculogram (EOG) was recorded at the same bandpass and sampling rate as the EEG. Electromyographic activity (EMG) was also recorded using a belly-tendon montage from three muscles: FLE, FDI, and EXT, all at a bandpass of 0-200 Hz and a sampling rate of 1000 Hz.",0
15,17,"The recorded finger position was divided into 30 epochs of 24 seconds each, commencing 2 seconds prior to the beginning of the trial. The mean finger position's temporal profile was ascertained for each participant by averaging the 30 epochs, and the finger position's grand average was calculated across all participants. T0, T1, and T2 were identified based on the finger position's grand average, with T0 representing a three-second static force period, T1 corresponding to a period distinguished by significant transient fluctuations of the finger position, and T2 representing a period in which the finger position reached a steady state and remained stable until the conclusion of the force modulation.  (Figure 1E illustrates this.)",0
15,18,"The analysis only included data from two periods, T1 and T2. During each trial, the data recorded during the 15-second sinusoidal force modulation was separated into two sets, T1 (3 seconds) and T2 (12 seconds). These sets were further divided into 1-second segments with a 50% overlap for spectral analysis. Eye movement-contaminated segments were excluded from the analysis using visual artifact rejection. The EEG signal was transformed into the reference-free current source density distribution using the spherical spline interpolation method. For each subject, 100 segments were obtained from T1, and 400 from T2.",0
15,19,"The EMG signals were subjected to fullwave rectification, as this method is suitable for power and coherence analysis and provides the temporal pattern of grouped firing motor units [32]. Each segment was then subject to a discrete 1000 points Fourier transform.",0
15,20,"Figure 1D displays the desired force profiles for W1, W2, and W3. Despite the conditions, there were fluctuations (~ 3 mm) in the ring position during T0, which refers to the static force that follows the force ramp, as depicted in Figure 1E. However, all participants were able to compensate for the force ramp before T0 ended, allowing the finger to return to the '0' position before the force modulation started.",0
15,21,"The finger positions during 30 trials in all participants for W1, W2 and W3 are displayed in Figure 1E as grand-averages. The oscillation frequency in all three conditions corresponded to the target frequency. It is worth noting that the finger oscillations had larger amplitudes during the initial 3 seconds (T1 period) but became stabilized at slightly lower amplitudes during the T2 period. A steady-state oscillatory performance was observed around the '0' position with deviations of maximally 1.5 mm in both directions.",0
15,22,"Figure 2A displays the average DR values of all participants for the three conditions (W1, W2, and W3). It is evident that participants identified the frequency of force accurately in more than 90% of the 30 trials. The DR increased from around 90% to approximately 95% as the frequency of force modulation increased, with the highest DR observed for W3. The majority of the participants exhibited this trend, indicating that they were more aware of the temporal force profile as the force modulation rate increased. Nevertheless, the Friedman test did not show any significant difference among the three conditions in terms of DR values.",0
15,23,"There was a significant difference in performance errors (PE) between the two periods T1 and T2, with higher fluctuations in finger position during T1. This was supported by statistical comparison (F(1,7) = 95, p < 0.001) and reflected in the grand-average of finger position (Figure 1E). Additionally, PE increased significantly at higher frequencies (F(1,7) = 10.7, p < 0.01, Figure 2B) with a linear effect (p = 0.02) underpinning the increase rather than a quadratic effect.",0
15,24,"The highest coherences between EEG and EMG were witnessed in the opposite sensorimotor cortex (C3 or C1). Figure 3 and Figure 4 exhibit coherence curves of the 0.6 Hz, 1 Hz, and 1.6 Hz conditions of eight individuals during T1 and T2 times, respectively.",0
15,25,"During the initial phase T1, the CMC spectra displayed a number of sharp peaks with random patterns scattered across the range of 15-45 Hz (as illustrated in Figure 3). Subsequently in phase T2, where motor performance became comparably consistent, the CMC spectra exhibited consistent coherences resolved from beta (15-32) to gamma (25-45 Hz) bands (as seen in Figure 4). The statistical analysis of three-way ANOVA corroborated the enhanced CMC in T2 as a principal source of variation, with considerably greater values (F(1,7) = 21, p < 0.001).",0
15,26,"Based on Figure 4, the majority of the five subjects displayed broad-band Coherent Motion in gamma-range (25-45 Hz), while three of the subjects exhibited it in beta-range (15-32 Hz). The factor Subject had a significant main effect on the Center of Gravity (CoG) which led to the categorization of the subjects into more beta- and more gamma-group. However, some subjects showed peaks in both beta and gamma-range. For example, subjects S4, S5, and S6 displayed lower peaks in beta-range. The purpose of grouping subjects into beta- and gamma-groups was to capture the major differences in the CMC pattern.",0
15,27,The frequency of the modulated force did not have a significant effect on either the CMC amplitude or the CoGs according to the results of the statistical analysis.,0
15,28,"The study searched for significant CMC values between 0-5 Hz range that peaked at the frequencies of force modulation or their harmonics. All five gamma subjects demonstrated a low-frequency CMC peak at 2 Hz, which matched the frequency modulation W3. This peak was consistently observed in the 1.6 Hz condition and was observed over both sensorimotor areas. Low-frequency CMC peaks at 2 Hz were only observed in electrodes above sensorimotor areas and none of the beta-group subjects had this peak. The results are shown in Figure 4 and 5.",0
15,29,The ANOVA did not find any significant main effect or interaction for the three factors tested in relation to the amplitude of cortical motor SP. There was no increase in spectral power in the same frequency range among subjects with increased CMC in beta or gamma-range.,0
15,30,"There were no differences in beta and gamma power between subjects in the beta and gamma ranges during rest, as observed from their cortical spectral power.",0
15,31,"The objective of the study was to investigate the interactions of corticospinal during isometric compensation while altering the frequency of force modulation. The results revealed that a stable CMC and performance could only be achieved after the force was adjusted to the modulation frequency in the transitory phase. Sharp peaks in the 15-45 Hz range were observed in the CMC spectra during this phase, indicating a transitory regime of corticospinal circuits functioning. During the stationary phase, CMC occurred in five of the eight subjects in gamma-range and three of them in beta-range. The study found that force modulation frequencies did not modify the gamma or beta-range CMC. Additionally, a sharp CMC peak at 2 Hz was noticed solely during the highest frequency of force modulation, indicating that corticospinal circuits resonating at the force frequency have a crucial role in the task of isometric force compensation.",0
15,32,The focus of our research was to examine CMC in slow and precise natural movements that usually take place between 0-2 Hz frequency range. The results demonstrated that there was no alteration in the beta- and gamma-range CMC's amplitude or frequency range when the force modulation frequency was increased in this range.,0
15,33,"Any conclusions drawn from this outcome should consider the following constraints. The frequency of the force may actually affect corticospinal oscillations, but our experimental setup's specific frequency range of interest (0.6 - 1.6 Hz) could have masked this effect. We decided to limit this range due to concerns about muscle stiffness at higher frequencies and the need to perceive the modulated force's dynamic changes. Furthermore, even within this range, force frequency modulation might impact CMC, but EEG or MEG recordings cannot easily detect this due to the scattering of neighboring neural sources. Intracortical recordings are required to address this issue further. Nevertheless, our findings align with the possibility that neither the amplitude nor the frequency of modulated force has any bearing on CMC.",0
15,34,"The difficulty in interpreting the discovery of five gamma and three beta-range subjects becomes apparent considering that there was no significant difference in performance error and awareness of the modulation frequencies between the two groups, as reflected in the DR. Therefore, the variance in the CMC frequency range did not appear to have any correlation with behavioral performance or differences in prior experience. These results imply that there are inherent differences in CMC among individuals, and that they may equally complete the visuomotor task by recruiting different functional corticospinal circuits that resonate in either beta or gamma range. This was previously explained in a study of ours exploring the CMC while using modulated forces at 8% MVC [17].",0
15,35,"However, aside from interindividual differences, other factors should be considered. The beta- and gamma-subjects may have employed different strategies to compensate for the modulated forces. While they were instructed to attend to the force modulations and report the frequency, some may have opted to precisely encode the temporal profile of the force and generate an opposing ""dynamic"" pattern or exert a ""pseudo-static force"" at the 8% MVC level, regardless of modulation frequency. The former strategy may induce corticospinal oscillations in the gamma range to integrate proprioceptive, visual, and cognitive information rapidly, while the latter may rely primarily on the static characteristics of the force profile (the 8% MVC force level) and result in beta-range corticomuscular coherence, which is linked to stable and inflexible regimes of corticospinal interactions.",0
15,36,"The studies conducted previously showed that there was beta-range CMC during isometric compensation for low-level static forces at 4% MVC and predominantly gamma-range (30-45 Hz) CMC during dynamic force compensation. However, in a recent study where different levels of a modulated force (8, 16, 24% MVC) were applied, broad-band beta-range CMC was also found. Hence, beta-range CMC is not restricted to low-level static forces only. The sensorimotor system may employ either beta- or gamma-range CMC to create effective corticospinal interaction for compensating dynamic modulated forces. Both mechanisms represent effective corticospinal interaction and can be selectively used to fulfill different functions.",0
15,37,"The conclusion made by Tallon-Baudry in her review article is that there is no direct correlation between a frequency band and a particular cognitive function. However, our findings show that the same holds true for frequency band and individual motor function as well.",0
15,38,"At the highest investigated force modulation frequency of 1.6 Hz, an extra CMC peak at the same frequency was discovered. This peak was only seen in the five gamma subjects. Recent studies of corticospinal interaction when participants synchronized rhythmic foot movements or isometric contraction of calf muscles to external periodic events have demonstrated similar CMC patterns over the sensorimotor area. In instances where a CMC peak was linked with muscle contraction or movement frequency, it correlated with corticospinal synchronization processes during dynamic motor output. We perceive the coexistence of a CMC peak at 1.6 Hz (modulated force frequency) and gamma-range CMC as evidence of effective corticospinal interaction. The fact that the CMC peak at 2 Hz was solely found at the highest frequency tested (1.6 Hz) might be explained by larger performance faults, implying increased task difficulty. Prior research has shown that for frequencies exceeding 1.5 Hz, performance difficulties intensify during a tracking task, as stated by Flowers.",0
15,39,"Nesting low-frequency oscillations (theta) with high-frequency ones (gamma) facilitates multiplexing of processes in the same area, according to studies [39,45,46]. Lakatos et al. [47] proposed that slower rhythms create openings for high-frequency oscillations to be activated. The nesting of CMC gamma-range into 1.6 Hz oscillations may assist in managing the increased task demands in our experiment.",0
15,40,"The DR increased with higher force frequencies, exceeding 95% for the 1.6 Hz modulation. This corresponds with previous research that suggests increased awareness of external periodic events occurs with a higher rate of change. Nonetheless, any association between awareness of force frequency and a CMC peak at the corresponding frequency is largely speculative, and requires further assessment through experimental paradigms that explicitly manipulate awareness of the force profiles.",0
15,41,"According to our study, the rate of force modulation does not impact the beta- and gamma-range CMC while performing isometric compensation at 8% MVC. Individual differences may be a factor in the beta- and gamma-range CMC. However, the peak in CMC at 2 Hz during the highest force modulation frequency (1.6 Hz) suggests that corticospinal circuits resonating at the force frequency are crucial for isometric force compensation. Our results contribute to the understanding of global oscillatory processes and provide new insights into the dynamics of neural systems.",0
17,1,"Hypoalbuminemia may result from different conditions such as nephrotic syndrome, heart failure, liver disease, and malnutrition. In hospitalized patients, both acute and chronic inflammatory responses commonly cause hypoalbuminemia. Additionally, low serum albumin levels have been linked with a higher risk of mortality. As such, the serum albumin level is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality among older individuals and acts as a vital prognostic marker.",0

17,18,"Albumin, the main protein in the bloodstream, is produced solely by the liver and is made up of 585 amino acids with a molecular weight of around 69 kDa. Despite albumin being the most abundant plasma protein, 60% of it is found in the interstitial space, and it plays a vital role in maintaining the oncotic pressure within the vascular system. An insufficient albumin level results in lower oncotic pressure causing fluids to leak from the interstitial spaces into the peritoneal cavity, leading to ascites. Albumin is also an essential molecule transporter that binds to various substances such as bilirubin, free fatty acids, drugs, and hormones. Additionally, serum albumin is a widely available, multifunctional plasma protein, commonly known for its ligand-binding and transport characteristics, as well as antioxidant and enzymatic activities.",0
17,19,"A low concentration of serum albumin is an indication of poor liver function, but it does not immediately occur in cases of acute liver failure. The decline in serum albumin levels happens gradually over several weeks due to impaired albumin production. Chronic liver failure caused by cirrhosis is the leading reason for low albumin levels. During the early stages of chronic liver disease, the serum albumin concentration is typically normal until significant liver damage and cirrhosis develop. In advanced liver disease, the serum albumin level can drop below 3.5 g/dl. Clinically, the albumin level is an important predictive factor for patients with liver cirrhosis because low serum albumin levels can lead to ascites and edema.",0
17,20,"Nutritional interventions such as BCAA supplementation have been shown to improve hypoalbuminemia in cirrhotic patients. Kotho et al. found that exercise and protein-rich nutrition in the early stages of cirrhosis may benefit maintaining or increasing muscular volume. Nishiguchi et al. reported that oral BCAA supplementation could help maintain serum albumin in patients in the compensated stage with a lower BTR. Early stage nutritional interventions could improve prognosis and QOL.

18,17,"MiRNAs are increasingly found to play a role in mammalian biology and breast cancer. MiR-206 levels have been observed to be higher in ERalpha-negative MB-MDA-231 cells compared to ERalpha-positive MCF-7 cells, while enforced expression of miR-125a or miR-125b leads to suppression of ERBB2 and ERBB3 in the human breast cancer cell line SKBR3. Additionally, MiR-27b expressed in MCF-7 cells may contribute to high CYP1B1 levels in cancerous tissues, and miR-17-5p suppresses breast cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting AIB1 mRNA translation.",0
18,18,"The roles of BCSC-related miRNAs in breast cancer have significant importance, and the isolation of tumorigenic breast cancer cells with stem/progenitor cell properties by Ponti and screening of side population (SP) cells from a breast cancer cell line by Huang highlights this. This study aimed to investigate the miRNA expression profile of the ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/Low subpopulation from the MCF-7 cell line, and the concordant results from real-time RT-PCR and microarray data validate the miRNA expression profiles of BCSCs.",0
18,19,"miRNA expression in BCSCs has been the subject of a few recent studies. According to Shimono's research, 37 miRNAs were either upregulated or downregulated in BCSCs compared to non-tumorigenic breast cancer cells. Human BCSCs exhibited a decrease in three clusters of miRNAs, namely miR-200c-141, miR-200b-200a-429, and miR-183-96182. MCF-7 cells showed overexpression of miR-200c, which resulted in the decline of transcription factor 8's expression and an increase in E-cadherin. Human BCSCs have been previously reported to showcase a downregulation of Let-7 miRNAs instead of miR-200C. Let-7 regulates several breast cancer stem cell properties by inhibiting more than one target. While Let-7 miRNAs reduce in BCSCs, they increase during differentiation.",0
18,20,"The miRNA expression profiles of BCSCs were obtained, providing a solid foundation for investigating the roles of miRNAs in maintaining stem cell features and biological functions of BCSCs. Our findings showed that miR-200C expression was about 3 times lower in BCSCs compared to MCF-7 cells, whilst Let-7 family member expression was mostly unchanged between the two cell types, except for Let-7e. Inconsistencies in Let-7 and miR-200C expression could be due to tumor histology or genetic variations in cell lines. Furthermore, the existence of certain predicted miRNAs in BCSCs was detected, but real-time RT-PCR verification was limited due to lack of accurate miRNA sequences necessary to synthesize precise primers. Future examination of these characteristic BCSC miRNAs will help expand our knowledge on miRNA functions in breast cancer research.",0
18,21,"Bioinformatic analysis and prediction programs have been utilized as the primary methods for investigating the function of miRNAs. The genes possibly regulated by these specific BCSC miRNAs are associated with both tumorigenesis and stem cell maintenance. Despite previous reports indicating that miR-122a is solely expressed in liver tissue, our results indicate upregulation of miR-122a in BCSCs. This was confirmed through Q-RT-PCR as well as the detection of miR-122a in the Ambion dataset. Bioinformatic analysis has shown that several cancer-related genes are potential targets of miR-122a. Studies have further demonstrated that miR-122a likely functions as an important gene regulatory factor in cancer cells, including cancer stem cells. Another example is miR21, which is expressed in embryonic stem cells, neuronal cells, as well as several tumor tissues and has a variety of functions.",0
18,22,"The analysis of miR-21's target revealed two sets of genes with contrasting functions, namely PLAG1 and PDCD4. While PLAG1 is a cancer-promoting gene and aids in the formation of adenocarcinoma, PDCD4 acts as a tumor suppressor gene and restrains neoplastic development. Recent studies have confirmed that PDCD4 is indeed a direct target of miR-21, but it is still unclear whether PLAG1 is as well. Additionally, miR-21 potentially targets other oncogenes like RAB11A, RAB6A, RAB6C, RASGRP1, RHOB, and RASA1, and their mechanisms in breast cancer remain to be explored. These questions remain unanswered.",0
18,23,"The identification of potential targets for different BCSC-related miRNAs suggested that some targets were shared between multiple miRNAs. For instance, PLAG1 was a potential target for both miR-224 and miR-200a, and the expression of miR-200a was lower in BCSCs and higher in MCF-7 cells. Conversely, miR-224 expression was elevated in BCSCs and lower in MCF-7 cells. It is probable that miRNAs differentially expressed in BCSCs might regulate common target genes and assemble a miRNA gene network by cooperating or competing with each other to control the development of BCSCs.",0
18,24,"It has been reported that miR-301, miR-296, miR-21 and miR-373* are expressed in stem cells, including human embryonic stem cells, suggesting that these miRNAs may be involved in maintaining stem cell features. Further research is needed to confirm the potential targets of all the miRNAs associated with BCSCs that were discovered in this study.",0
