15,1,"In the last two decades, corticomuscular synchronization during isometric compensation of static forces has been extensively studied. Beta-range (15-30 Hz) corticomuscular coherence (CMC) has been reported between motor cortical neurons and muscles in monkeys [1-4] and between sensorimotor cortex and muscle activity (EMG) in humans [5-14].",1
15,2,"Several investigations focused on the mechanisms by which cortex drives the muscles under dynamic conditions. It was shown that gamma-range (above 30 Hz) CMC reflected effective corticospinal interactions and different gamma-subranges were associated with various motor tasks [15-19]. For instance, Schoffelen et al [15] found that the subjects’ readiness to respond in a simple reaction-time task was closely correlated with the strength of one gamma-range (40-70 Hz) CMC between motor cortex and EMG activity. In addition, Brown and colleagues [20] showed that, while weak static forces were accompanied by beta-range CMC, gamma-range (35-60 Hz) CMC occurred mainly for submaximal and maximal forces. Significant ECoG-EMG coherence in the high gamma subrange (61-100 Hz) was also reported during phasic movements [21]. For a visuomotor isometric compensation of a periodically modulated force at 4% MVC we found a lower (30-45 Hz) CMC gammasubrange [18,22,23]. We suggested that this low gammasubrange reflects the rapid integration of proprioceptive, visual and cognitive (preparatory attention) information required to produce the appropriate motor command. Since we had found that this gamma-range CMC is not modulated by the amplitude of the modulated force [23] we wondered whether it would be modulated by various frequencies.",1
15,3,"We addressed this question investigating the CMC, cortical motor spectral power, as well as motor performance during a visuomotor task, where subjects compensated isometrically a periodically modulated force at 8% MVC with three frequencies (0.6, 1.0 and 1.6 Hz).",1
15,4,"We tested the following predictions: First, based on our earlier results showing a shift of the CMC from beta- to gamma-range during compensation of static and periodically modulated force respectively [18,23,24], we predicted that with increase in frequency modulation the CMC will be shifted towards higher frequencies in order to effectively integrate sensorimotor information.",1
15,5,"Second, recent studies on corticospinal interaction during rhythmic hand movements have reported that increased beta-range CMC was accompanied by a CMC peak at the frequency of the movement or of the periodic muscle contraction [25,26]. Based on these results, we predicted CMC peaks at the frequencies of modulated force. We also speculated that these low-frequency CMC peaks should be stronger for more difficult tasks and hence, for higher frequencies.",1
15,6,"We found that beta- and gamma-range CMC and cortical motor spectral power were not modulated by the various frequencies of the modulated force. However, a sharp bilateral CMC peak at 1.6 Hz was observed, but only in the five gamma-range CMC subjects. Our findings suggest that the tested frequency of force modulation have no effect on the beta- and gamma-range CMC during isometric compensation for modulated forces at 8% MVC. In addition, they support that the frequency range of CMC depends on a multiplicity of factors, i.e. task parameters, inter-individual differences and possibly the behavioral strategy applied by each individual.",1
15,7,"Eight healthy right-handed subjects (female, mean age 28 ± 10 years) without any history of neurological disease participated in the study. Handedness was tested according to the Oldfield questionnaire [27]. Three of the subjects had already participated in similar experiments in our lab. All subjects participated according to the declaration of Helsinki, with informed consent and the approval of the local ethics committee.",1
15,8,"During the experimental session, the subject sat in an electrically shielded, dimly lit room. The right arm was supported by a splint and the subject was instructed to place the hand over a sphere and the right index finger in the ring of a home-made manipulandum (see Figure 1B).",1
15,9,"The manipulandum was designed for applying vertical forces on the finger at the level of the metacarpophalangeal joint. A computer-controlled tooth belt drive produced a variable force on the ring. The subject had to compensate the force generated by the manipulandum isometrically to maintain the ring in its initial position (see Figure 1B). Visual feedback (see Figure 1C) about the position of the ring was provided via a 19’’ monitor placed 100 cm in front of the subject and displaying two concentric circles. The green outer circle was located in the centre of the screen and represented the ring’s reference position while the white inner circle moved corresponding to the ring’s actual position. The subject had to maintain the small white circle inside the green one, so that when a given force was applied to the ring the subject had to compensate it by generating force in the opposite direction (here flexion). The sensitivity of the visual feedback with respect to the finger position corresponded to 2 mm on the screen for 1 mm ring displacement.",1
15,10,"The target force had four different phases (Figure 1D): a ramp phase (rising cosine function) which ensures a smooth start of the generated force. In all experimental conditions, the force level, or ramp amplitude, was 8% MVC. The 1 s ramp phase was followed by a 3 s-period of static force (T0) that gave time to stabilize the force to the “0” position (8% MVC). After the static period, the sinusoidally modulated force period with 8% MVC peak-to-peak amplitude and lasting 15 s was followed by downward ramp phase (again cosine function) to ensure a smooth end of the generated force.",1
15,11,"Three different experimental conditions were investigated in a given recording session (Figure 1D): 
• 0.6 Hz condition (W1): The frequency of the force modulation was 0.6 Hz (Figure 1D, left panel). 
• 1 Hz condition (W2): the frequency of the force modulation was 1 Hz (Figure 1D, middle panel). 
• 1.6 Hz condition (W3): The frequency of the force modulation was 1.6 Hz (Figure 1D, right panel).",1
15,12,"The three frequencies W1, W2, and W3 were carefully selected so that they were equidistant on a logarithmic scale, holding the following relations: W2 = 5/3 × W1, and W3 = 8/5 × W2 where (5/3 = 1.67) is approximately equal to (8/5 = 1.6). Therefore, W2 is approximately the geometric mean of W1 and W3. This selection is in line with the notion that signal discrimination in humans is usually following logarithmic rules (see [28]). Besides, any single stimulus frequency would not overlap with the frequency spectrum of another stimulus frequency including its harmonics in order to reduce unwanted crosstalk [29].",1
15,13,"Prior to the experiment, we recorded rest EEG for 5 minutes while subjects were attending at the small white circle and their right hand was resting over the sphere with the right index finger in the ring of the manipulandum. During this rest period no force was applied by the manipulandum, so that the index finger remained static in its initial position. After that the force corresponding to the individual MVC was measured. An experimental session consisted of 5 different recording series, while each series included 18 trials. The 3 experimental conditions W1, W2 and W3 were presented in a pseudo-randomized fashion within the 18 trials, so that each frequency appeared 6 times within one recording series. Therefore, a total of 30 trials were recorded in each subject for each of the three frequency conditions. To avoid muscle fatigue, rest intervals of 7 to 12 s were included between the trials and approx. 5 min between the series.",1
15,14,"To optimize performance and to avoid attentional variation across trials, the subjects were requested to concentrate on the temporal structure of the applied force profile and to tune the isometric contraction of their finger muscles to the identified force frequency. After each trial, they had to verbally report the frequency of the force modulation as ‘slow’, ‘middle’ and ‘fast’, corresponding to the frequencies 0.6 Hz (W1), 1 Hz (W2), and 1.6 Hz (W3) respectively.",1
15,15,"The subjects were instructed to avoid any other movements and to fix their gaze on the concentric circles displayed on the screen. Before the onset of the recordings, subjects performed some trials to get familiarized with the task.",1
15,16,"Electrical potentials (bandpass 0-200 Hz, sampling rate 1000 Hz) were recorded from 58 scalp positions according to the international 10-10 system (Synamp 2, NeuroScan, El Paso, TX, USA) referenced to Cz (Figure 1A) with ground at FzA. Electrode impedances were kept under 5 kOhm. The electrooculogram (EOG, same bandpass and sampling rate as for EEG) was recorded to exclude trials contaminated with eye movements from further analysis. Electromyographic activity (EMG, bandpass 0-200 Hz; sampling rate 1000 Hz) was recorded with surface electrodes using a belly-tendon montage from three muscles: the pars indicis of the right flexor digitorum superficialis (FLE), prime mover of the index finger flexion, the right first dorsal interosseus (FDI), and the right extensor digitorum communis (EXT).",1
15,17,"In each condition the recorded finger position was first cut into 30 epochs of 24 s each starting from 2 s before the onset of the trial (Figure 1E). Then for each participant, the temporal profile of the mean finger position was obtained by averaging the 30 epochs, and the grand average of the finger position was computed across all participants. Based on the grand average of the finger position, three periods (T0, T1 and T2) were identified (Figure 1E). The 3 s static force period was named T0. T1 corresponded to the period during which the finger position showed large transient fluctuations. T2 corresponded to the period in which the finger position reached a steady state and remained stable until the end of the force modulation.",1
15,18,"Only data from period T1 and T2 was included in the analysis. In each trial, the data recorded during the 15 s sinusoidal force modulation (Figure 1E) was first separated in two data sets corresponding to periods T1 (3 s) and T2 (12 s). Then, for both periods (T1 and T2), data was further cut into segments with an overlap of 50%. Segments had duration of 1 s, therefore allowing a frequency resolution of 1 Hz for further spectral analysis. Artifact rejection was visually performed off-line trial-by-trial to exclude segments contaminated with eye movements. The EEG signal was then transformed into the reference-free current source density distribution (CSD) which reflects the underlying cortical activity [30]. The CSD algorithm was estimated using the spherical spline interpolation method [31] implemented in the commercial software ‘BrainVision’ 1.05 (München, Germany). For each subject, 100 artifact-free segments were obtained from the period T1, while 400 segments were obtained for the period T2.",1
15,19,"EMG signals were rectified, as it is known that fullwave rectification, providing the temporal pattern of grouped firing motor units [32], is an appropriate procedure for power and coherence analysis [33]. The discrete 1000 points Fourier transform was computed for each segment.",1
15,20,"Figure 1D shows the target force profiles for the three conditions W1, W2, and W3. In all three conditions fluctuations (~ 3 mm) of the ring position during T0, i.e. the static force following the force ramp, were observed (Figure 1E). The force ramp was compensated by all subjects before the end of the period T0, so that the finger came back to the ‘0’ position before the onset of the force modulation.",1
15,21,"For W1, W2 and W3 the grand-averages of the finger position during the 30 trials in all participants are shown in Figure 1E. The frequency of the oscillations corresponded to the target frequency in all three conditions. Note that finger oscillations started with larger amplitudes during the initial 3 s (period T1) but stabilized at slightly lower amplitudes during the period T2, where a steady-state oscillatory performance is observed around the ‘0’ position with deviations of maximally 1.5 mm in both directions.",1
15,22,"Figure 2A shows the mean DR values for the three conditions W1, W2 and W3 for all subjects. One can see that subjects successfully identified the frequency of the force (as slow, middle or fast) in more than 90% of the 30 trials. In addition, the DR showed a tendency to increase from ~90% to ~95% with higher frequency of force modulation, so that the highest detection rate (DR) was observed for W3. This tendency was present in most of the subjects. This suggests that subjects were more aware of the temporal force profile when the force modulation rate increased. However, the Friedman test for the DR values did not show any significant difference among the three conditions.",1
15,23,"The statistical comparison of the performance errors (PE) in the two periods T1 and T2 revealed a highly significant difference (F(1,7) = 95, p < 0.001), reinforcing the fact that fluctuations in finger position were higher during the transition period T1, as can be seen in the grand-average of the finger position (Figure 1E). In addition, PE significantly increased at higher frequencies (F(1,7) = 10.7, p < 0.01, see Figure 2B). The analysis of the polynomial contrast showed that the increase of PE for higher frequencies was due to a linear effect (p = 0.02), the quadratic part being not significant.",1
15,24,"The maximum EEG-EMG coherences were observed over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex (C3 or C1). Individual EEG-EMG coherence curves of the eight subjects for the 0.6 Hz, 1 Hz and 1.6 Hz conditions during the periods T1 and T2 are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 respectively.",1
15,25,"During the transitory period T1 the CMC spectra contained several random-like sharp peaks distributed in the 15-45 Hz range (Figure 3). In period T2, when motor performance reached a rather stable state, the CMC spectra showed consistent broadband coherences within the beta- (15-32) and gamma (25-45 Hz) range (Figure 4). The three-way ANOVA revealed significant main effect of the factor Period with significantly higher CMC in T2 (F(1,7) = 21, p < 0.001).",1
15,26,"As seen in Figure 4, five of the subjects have broad-band CMC mostly in gamma-range (25-45 Hz) while three subjects had it in beta-range (15-32 Hz), as supported by a significant main effect of factor Subject for the CoG (F(1,7) = 9, p < 0.01). The subjects were accordingly classified in more beta- and more gamma-group. Note that although the CMC data fits fairly well to this clear-cut classification, there are subjects with peaks in both beta and gamma-range. For example, in Figure 4 the gammasubjects S4, S5 and S6 show lower peaks in beta-range. The classification in beta- and gamma-groups was meant to capture the major differences of the CMC pattern.",1
15,27,"No significant effect of the main factor Frequency was found. Thus, the outcome of the statistical analysis reveals that neither the CMC amplitude nor the CoGs are influenced by the frequency of the modulated force.",1
15,28,"We also looked for significant CMC values within the 0 - 5 Hz range, peaking at the frequencies of force modulation (W1, W2 or W3) or their harmonics. All five gamma subjects had a low-frequency CMC peak at 2 Hz, that matches the frequency modulation W3 (1.6 Hz), according to the 1 Hz spectral resolution. This low-frequency CMC peak was consistently observed in the 1.6 Hz condition only (Figure 4). This CMC peak at 2 Hz in W3 condition was observed not only over the contralateral, but also over the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex, as displayed in the topographic maps of one individual and of the grand average in Figure 5. Significant low-frequency CMC peaks at 2 Hz were observed only in electrodes above sensorimotor areas. None of the three beta-group subjects had such a peak (see Figure 4, left column).",1
15,29,"With respect to the cortical motor SP amplitude, the ANOVA did not reveal any significant main effect for the three tested factors or their interactions. Subjects showing increased CMC in beta- or gamma-range did not show any corresponding increase in spectral power in the same frequency range.",1
15,30,The cortical spectral power during rest did not show any differences between beta- and gamma-range subjects in terms of beta and gamma power.,1
15,31,"The present study was designed to investigate the corticospinal interactions during isometric compensation for force modulated at three different frequencies (0.6, 1.0, 1.6 Hz). A stable CMC and performance only occurred after a transitory phase in which the force had to be adjusted to the modulation frequency. During the transitory phase (period T1), the CMC spectra contained several random-like sharp peaks distributed in the 15-45 Hz range. This pattern may arise due to a transitory regime of corticospinal circuits functioning during the first 3 s. During the stationary phase (Period T2), CMC occurred in five of the eighth subjects in gamma-range and in three of them in beta-range. The findings from the study show the presence of significant broad-band gamma-range CMC in five of the eight subjects and betarange in three of them. Neither the gamma-range CMC, nor the beta-range CMC were modified by the various force modulation frequencies. In addition, a sharp CMC peak at 2 Hz was observed only during the highest frequency of force modulation (1.6 Hz) suggesting that corticospinal circuits resonating at the force frequency also play an important role in our isometric force compensation task.",1
15,32,We were specifically interested in studying CMC during high-precision slow-paced natural movements which typically occur within the 0-2 Hz frequency range. The findings show that increasing the force modulation frequency within this range did not induce any changes in amplitude or frequency range of the beta- and gammarange CMC.,1
15,33,"Any interpretation of this result should take into consideration the following: Corticospinal oscillations may be actually modulated by the frequency of the force, but this effect could not be manifested in our experimental design due to the specific frequency range of interest (0.6 - 1.6 Hz). This range was delimited by several constraints: First, the upper extreme of this range was set at 1.6 Hz to avoid muscular stiffness associated to higher frequencies, while the lower extreme was set above 0.5 Hz to facilitate the sensory perception of the dynamically modulated force. Second, CMC could be actually modulated by the force frequency even within this range of interest, but we cannot easily detect this effect with non-invasive recordings such as EEG or MEG due to spatiotemporal smearing of neighboring neural sources [35,36]. Therefore, intracortical recordings are needed to further clarify this issue. Within these constrains and limitations, our results rather align with the view that CMC is not modulated neither by the amplitude [23] nor the frequency of the modulated force.",1
15,34,"The finding of five gamma- and three beta-range subjects is difficult to interpret when considering that performance error (PE) and awareness of the modulation frequencies as reflected in the DR did not differ significantly between the two groups. Thus, difference in the CMC frequency range was not correlated to behavioral performance. Moreover, this finding was not related to differences in experience in similar experiments. These results suggest that there are intrinsic inter-individual differences in CMC, whereas subjects may equally perform the visuomotor task recruiting different functional corticospinal circuits resonating in the beta- or gamma range. We described this in a previous work of ours investigating the CMC during modulated forces at 8% MVC [17].",1
15,35,"However, in addition to the interindividual differences some other differences could be taken into consideration: The beta- and gamma-subjects may have differed in their strategy to compensate for the modulated forces. Subjects were requested to attend to the force modulations in order to recognize and report the frequency as slow, middle or fast. Nevertheless, subjects may have chosen: i) to encode precisely the temporal profile of the force and reproduce the “dynamic” pattern, generating a force in the opposite direction, or ii) to exert a “pseudo-static force” at the 8% MVC level, independently of the modulation frequency. The first, “dynamic”, strategy may elicit corticospinal oscillations in gamma-range to rapidly and continuously integrate proprioceptive, visual, and cognitive (preparatory attention) information and meet the demands of a dynamic environment [18]. The second, “pseudo-static”, strategy, even in the presence of a dynamic modulated force, is mainly relying on the static features of the force profile (the 8% MVC force level) and may lead to beta-range CMC, which is shown to be associated with rather rigid and stable regimes of corticospinal interactions [11,37,38].",1
15,36,"Our previous studies reported beta-range CMC during isometric compensation for low-level static forces at 4% MVC and predominantly gamma-range (30-45 Hz) CMC during dynamic force compensation [8,11,18,23]. However, in a recent investigation of the CMC during a visuomotor task where different levels of a modulated force (8, 16, 24% MVC) were applied [17], we also found broad-band beta-range CMC. Taken together, we conclude that beta-range CMC is not confined to or specific for low-level static forces only. Rather, the sensorimotor system may resort to either beta- or gamma-range CMC to generate effective corticospinal interaction when compensating for dynamic modulated forces. Both beta- and gamma-range CMC represent mechanisms for effective corticospinal interaction and can be selectively used to subserve different functions [8,15].",1
15,37,In her review article Tallon-Baudry [39] concludes that there is no one-to-one relationship between a frequency band and a single cognitive function. Our results demonstrate that there is no one-to-one relationship between frequency band and specific motor function either.,1
15,38,"For the highest force modulation frequency investigated (1.6 Hz) we found an additional sharp CMC peak at the same frequency. This low-frequency peak was observed only in the five gamma subjects. Similar CMC patterns over the sensorimotor area have been observed in recent studies of corticospinal interaction for tasks requiring to synchronize rhythmic foot movements or periodic isometric contraction of calf muscles to external periodic events [40]. In this work, a CMC peak at the frequency of the movements or muscle contraction was associated with corticospinal synchronization processes during dynamic motor output. Following the same line of reasoning, we interpret the co-existence of gamma-range CMC and of a CMC peak at 1.6 Hz (modulated force frequency) as support to our view of gamma-range CMC as reflecting effective corticospinal interaction. The fact that this CMC peak at 2 Hz was found only for the highest frequency tested (1.6 Hz) can be explained when considering that in this condition the performance errors were significantly larger, indicating an increase in task difficulty. In fact, previous work by Flowers [41] has shown that difficulties in performance of a tracking task increase for frequencies above 1.5 Hz.",1
15,39,"Nesting of high-frequency oscillations (gamma) into low-frequency ones (theta) is suggested to multiplex processes in the same location [39,45,46]. Lakatos et al. [47] hypothesized that slower rhythms provide windows, in which the high-frequency rhythms are activated. It is possible that in our study the nesting of the gammarange CMC into 1.6 Hz oscillations contributes to cope with the higher task demands in this condition.",1
15,40,"The detection rate (DR) was higher for higher force frequencies, with value above 95% for the 1.6 Hz modulation. This result is in line with studies showing that perceptual awareness of external periodic events increase with the rate of change of these events [48,49]. However, a relationship between awareness of force frequency and a CMC peak at the same frequency remains at best highly speculative, and should be addressed in experimental paradigms where level of awareness of the force profiles are explicitly manipulated.",1
15,41,Our findings suggest that the frequency of force modulation has no effect on the beta- and gamma-range CMC during isometric compensation for modulated forces at 8% MVC. The beta- and gamma-range CMC may be related to interindividual differences. The sharp CMC peak at 2 Hz during the highest frequency of force modulation (1.6 Hz) suggest that corticospinal circuits resonating at the force frequency also play an important role in isometric force compensation. Our results are a step towards further understanding of the global oscillatory processes and help to get new insights in the dynamics of neural systems [50].,1
17,1,"Hypoalbuminemia can be caused by various conditions, including nephrotic syndrome [1,2], heart failure [3], liver disease [4,5] and malnutrition [6]. Most cases of hypoalbuminemia among hospitalized patients are caused by acute and chronic inflammatory responses [7]. Moreover, a strong association has been reported between the serum albumin level and mortality [8]. The serum albumin level is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in older persons and an important prognostic indicator [9].",1
17,2,"From 1990, we have continued carrying out health screenings of the residents of X town (adult population: 7,389) in northern Kyushu, Japan, where the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the highest in the country and the mortality from liver cancer is about three times the national average [10-23]. The positive rates of antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV), HCV RNA and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were, respectively, 23.6%, 17.9%, and 2.6% in 1990 [15]. We demonstrated extrahepatic manifestations as well as the natural course and carcinogenesis of HCV-infected persons in X town.",1
17,3,"There has been little discussion about hypoalbuminemia and mortality over the long term in residents of the area. In this study, we determined whether serum albumin levels impact on the life prognosis of the residents of X town after a follow-up period of 12 years.",1

We studied 509 consecutive residents prospectively for 12 years. Of these 509 subjects, 69 had died and 55 had moved to other regions by May 31, 2002. Therefore, 385 of the original inhabitants investigated in 1990 continued to reside in X town in May 2002. Consequently, 454 residents, whose life and death could be confirmed between 1990 and 2002, were studied. The albumin levels were categorized into two groups, low (<4.0 g/L, group A) and normal (≥4.0 g/L, group B) and there were 25 subjects in group A and 429 in group B.",1

Sera were also examined for the presence or absence of markers of HCV and HBV infection. AntiHCV was measured by a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) kit (Lumipulse II HCV, Fujirebio Inc., Tokyo, Japan). HCV RNA was detected in the sera using the Amplicor HCV test (Nippon Roche, Tokyo, Japan). HBsAg was assayed by a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) kit (Architect™, HBsAg QT, Dainabot Co.

However, there has been little discussion about hypoalbuminemia and mortality of the residents of an area with an exceptionally high prevalence of HCV infection. In this study, we determined whether serum albumin levels affect the life prognosis of the residents of X town.",1
17,16,Our results indicate a strong association between hypoalbuminemia and mortality in this hyperendemic area of HCV infection in Japan. Residents with hypoalbuminemia had a mortality of 68.0%; dramatically higher than the rate of 12.1% among residents who had normal albumin levels. We previously reported that HCV infection and ALT value were associated with deaths due to HCC or liver cirrhosis in this X town [17]. We also showed that hypoalbuminemia was prognostic factor about all-cause mortality.,1
17,17,"It is estimated that ~170 million people worldwide are infected with HCV [24], some two million (1%) of whom reside in Japan [25]. HCV leads to serious consequences such as liver cirrhosis and HCC. Of the HCC cases in Japan, around 16% are caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and around 80% by HCV infection. The increase in the number of HCC patients due to HCV contributes to the increase in total deaths in Japan from HCC. This trend is expected to continue until 2015 [25].",1
17,18,"Albumin, produced only by the liver, is the major protein that circulates in the blood. Albumin consists of 585 amino acids, has a molecular weight of approximately 69 kDa and is the most abundant plasma protein, although 60% of the total albumin pool is in the interstitial space [26]. Albumin is essential for maintaining the oncotic pressure in the vascular system. A decrease in oncotic pressure due to a low albumin level allows fluid to leak from the interstitial spaces into the peritoneal cavity, producing ascites. Albumin is also very important in the transportation of various molecules, including bilirubin, free fatty acids, drugs, and hormones. Serum albumin is an abundant multifunctional non-glycosylated, negatively charged plasma protein, with ascribed ligand-binding and transport properties, antioxidant functions, and enzymatic activities [27].",1
17,19,"A low serum albumin concentration indicates poor liver function. Decreased serum albumin levels are not seen in acute liver failure because it takes several weeks of impaired albumin production until the serum albumin level drops. The most common reason for a low albumin is chronic liver failure caused by cirrhosis. The serum albumin concentration is usually normal in chronic liver disease, until cirrhosis and significant liver damage develops. In advanced liver disease, the serum albumin level may be less than 3.5 g/dl. The albumin level is clinically important as a predictive factor for patients with liver cirrhosis, because decreased serum albumin levels cause ascites and edema.",1
17,20,"Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation in improving hypoalbuminemia in cirrhotic patients [28]. Kotho et al. investigated the correlation between albumin levels and the fat-free mass in cirrhotic patients [29]. They showed that exercise and proteinrich nutrition at the early stage of liver cirrhosis may be advisable for maintaining or increasing muscular volume. Nishiguchi et al reported that if cirrhotic patients were in the compensated stage at the entry but with lower BCAA tyrosine ratio (BTR), oral BCAA supplementation might be effective in maintaining serum albumin [30]. Stating appropriate nutritional interventions, such as supplementation of BCAA, in the early stage of cirrhosis may improve prognosis and maintain QOL. We also reported that the administration of BCAA supplement (Aminofeel ® ) increases serum albumin levels and serum zinc levels, and improves sensitivity to different tastes [31-33].",1
17,21,"In conclusion, we demonstrated that the serum albumin level is an independent risk factor for mortality from all causes and an important prognostic indicator in the residents of X town. In particular, improvement of hypoalbuminaemia as well as the eradication of HCV, such as by interferon therapy, should be considered for improvement of prognosis in this hyperendemic area of HCV infection in Japan.",1
18,17,"There is increasing evidence for the involvement of miRNAs in mammalian biology and breast cancer. For instance, the levels of MiR-206 have been found to be higher in ERalpha-negative MB-MDA-231 cells than in ERalpha-positive MCF-7 cells [12], and enforced expression of miR-125a or miR-125b leads to coordinate suppression of ERBB2 and ERBB3 in the human breast cancer cell line SKBR3 [13]. Furthermore, MiR-27b, which is expressed in MCF-7 cells, may be one of the causes of high expression of the drug-metabolising enzyme CYP1B1 in cancerous tissues [14]. Finally, as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer cells, miR-17-5p regulates breast cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting the translation of AIB1 mRNA [15].",1
18,18,"Research on the roles of BCSC-related miRNAs in breast cancer has great significance. Ponti [16] isolated tumorigenic breast cancer cells with stem/progenitor cell properties from a breast cancer cell line, and Huang [17] screened side population (SP) cells from a breast cancer cell line. Here, we investigated the miRNA expression profile of the ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/Low subpopulation from the MCF-7 cell line. Real-time RT-PCR was repeated three times, and the results were concordant with microarray data for the miRNA expression profiles of BCSCs.",1
18,19,"Recently, a few studies have reported miRNA expression in BCSCs. Shimono [18] found that 37 miRNAs were upregulated or downregulated in BCSCs compared to nontumorigenic breast cancer cells. Three clusters, miR-200c-141, miR-200b-200a-429, and miR-183-96182, were downregulated in human BCSCs. MiR-200c was shown to be overexpressed in MCF-7 cells, leading to reduced expression of transcription factor 8 and increased expression of E-cadherin [19]. Furthermore, the downregulation of Let-7 miRNAs rather than miR-200C was previously reported for human BCSCs [20]. Let-7 regulates multiple breast cancer stem cell properties by silencing more than one target, and Let-7 miRNAs are markedly reduced in BCSCs and increase with differentiation.",1
18,20,"We obtained miRNA expression profiles of BCSCs, providing a substantial basis for exploring the role of miRNAs in maintaining stem cell properties and the biological functions of BCSCs. Compared with previous reports, we found that miR-200C expression was about 3-fold lower in BCSCs than in MCF-7 cells as determined by Q-RT-PCR. Little change was observed in the expression of Let-7 family members, however, between BCSCs and MCF-7 cells, with the exception of Let-7e (data not shown). The discrepancies in Let-7 and miR200C expression between studies might be related to differences in tumor histology or the genetic backgrounds of the cell lines analysed. We also detected the expression of some predicted miRNAs in the BCSCs. Given that the existence of predicted miRNAs has yet to be validated, no accurate miRNA sequence could be used to synthesise accurate primers, making real-time RT-PCR verification unavailable. Further study of the functions of these characteristic BCSC miRNAs will facilitate research into the roles of miRNAs in breast cancer.",1
18,21,"Bioinformatic analysis and prediction programs have been the primary methods used to explore the function of miRNAs [21,22]. The genes possibly regulated by these characteristic BCSC miRNAs are involved in both tumorigenesis and stem cell maintenance. For example, miR-122a has been reported to be specific to liver tissue [23,24]; however, our results showed upregulation of miR-122a in BCSCs. The microarray data were verified by Q-RT-PCR. Furthermore, miR-122a was also detected in MCF-7 cells in the Ambion dataset. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the potential targets of miR-122a include several cancer-related genes. In previous reports, it has been shown that miR-122a plays a role in the genesis of hepatocellular carcinoma by blocking cyclin G1 expression [25]. Another study found that G3BP2, one of the potential targets of miR-122a, was more highly expressed in breast cancer tissue than in paraneoplastic tissue [26-28]. These studies indicate that miR-122a is likely to be an important gene regulatory factor in cancer cells, even cancer stem cells. Another example is miR21, which has been reported to have extensive roles and is expressed in embryonic stem cells [29], neuronal cells [30] and several tumor tissues [31,32].",1
18,22,"Interestingly, target analysis of miR-21 revealed two classes of genes with opposite functions, e.g., PLAG1 (pleiomorphic adenoma gene 1) and PDCD4 (Programmed cell death 4). As a cancer-promoting gene, PLAG1 plays an essential role in the processes of adenocarcinoma formation and malignant transformation in various types of tumors [35], whereas PDCD4 is a tumor suppressor gene that inhibits neoplastic transformation and tumor cell invasion and facilitates apoptosis [36]. Several recent studies have shown that the tumor suppressor PDCD4 is a target of miR-21 [37-39]. Nevertheless, the question remains whether PLAG1 is likely to be a target of miR-21. Moreover, the potential target genes of miR-21 include several oncogenes such as RAB11A, RAB6A, RAB6C, RASGRP1, RHOB and RASA1, etc. Are these genes the true targets of miR-21? What are the mechanisms of their involvement in the genesis of breast cancer? These intriguing questions remain to be answered.",1
18,23,"Furthermore, the prediction of potential targets for other BCSC-related miRNAs indicated overlap between the targets of different miRNAs. For example, PLAG1 was a potential target for both miR-224 and miR-200a, and the expression of miR-200a was lower in BCSCs than in MCF-7 cells. In contrast, the expression of miR224 was higher in BCSCs than in MCF-7 cells. It is likely that the miRNAs that are over-expressed or under-expressed in BCSCs may regulate common target genes and form a miRNA gene network by cooperating or competing with each other to regulate the development of BCSCs.",1
18,24,"Moreover, miR-301, miR-296, miR-21 and miR-373* have been reported to be expressed in human embryonic stem cells and other stem cells, indicating that these miRNAs may play a constitutive role in maintaining the biological characteristics of stem cells [40,41]. Future work should include verification of the potential targets of all of the BCSC-related miRNAs identified here.",1
18,25,"Here, we investigated the miRNA expression profile of the ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/Low BCSC subpopulation from the MCF-7 cell line. Our identification of BCSCrelated miRNAs should be a starting point to explore the functions of these miRNAs, adding a new dimension to our understanding of the complex picture of BCSCs and assisting cancer biologists and clinical oncologists in designing and testing novel therapeutic strategies.",1
14,1,"The evaluation of the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence depends on various factors that help determine a patient's risk. These factors, combined with predictive elements like estrogen-receptor status, help make the best decisions related to adjuvant systemic therapy. By balancing the potential benefits and consequences of treatment, optimal treatment decisions can be made. That's why it's crucial to have precise prognosticators that can accurately define a patient's risk category for breast cancer.",0
14,2,"Axillary lymph node status is currently the most significant factor for predicting breast cancer prognosis in women. For node-positive patients, there is a higher risk of distant recurrence based on the number of involved nodes. However, recommendations for systemic adjuvant chemotherapy are not always clear-cut even with the usefulness of lymph node status. For instance, five-year survival rates indicate that around 15% of node-negative patients with larger tumor sizes (>1 cm) may benefit from systemic adjuvant therapy, while about 85% can survive without it. Additionally, local-regional therapy may result in one-third of node-positive patients being free of recurrence.",0
14,3,"Prognostic risk factors that play a major role in node-negative patients include tumor size and histological tumor grade [1-4,9,10]. Tumor size significantly affects the outcome of node-negative patients and is usually considered while deciding on adjuvant treatment [6,11]. Tumor grade, on the other hand, is used to make decisions in cases where tumor sizes are borderline [1,2,5]. However, grading remains a challenging task due to significant inter-observer variation [12-14] as pathologists need to assess complex histological characteristics in a semi-quantitative manner.",0
14,4,"The loss of structural organization and functional coordination in invasive breast cancer can be seen through the increase in morphologic complexity of the tissue components at different levels. This complexity can be measured and related to patient outcome using fractal analysis, which is a valuable tool in quantifying complex pathological structures. In this study, the prognostic value of a new technique that measures the fractal dimension of histological structures of breast tissue microarray cores is being assessed. The technique uses pan-cytokeratin staining to highlight the epithelial architecture.",0
14,5,"A retrospective selection of 408 patients diagnosed with primary invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast from the Calgary Regional Hospitals was conducted with institutional ethics approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Patient consent was not required as it was a retrospective study with a low risk of exposing patient confidentiality, especially for deceased patients. Out of these patients, 379 had at least one of three TMA cores which was adequately stained for fractal analysis. The mean and median age at diagnosis for these patients were 65 and 66, respectively, with an age range of 34 to 95. Stage information was available for 375 of these patients, with the majority of patients being Stage I (60.0%), followed by Stage II (26.4%), and Stage III (13.6%). All patients selected had received adjuvant tamoxifen treatment between 1988 to 2006, and were identified through Alberta Cancer Board records of patients who had received tamoxifen treatment without chemotherapy. The inclusion criterion was any patient who had adequate tissue for TMA construction and received adjuvant tamoxifen treatment but no adjuvant chemotherapy.",0
14,6,"Hemotoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained sections were utilized to identify areas of tumors for TMA cores. A total of fourteen breast TMA blocks, each containing an average of 94 tissue cores, were created from untreated breast cancer tissue that had been fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. To ensure no bias was present, three 0.6 mm cores were randomly selected from cancerous areas of each donor block to form the recipient TMA core block. The Leica RM2235 microtome was used to cut 4 μm thick sections from each TMA donor block. In a previous study on prostate cancer specimens, we determined that pan-cytokeratin stained specimens provided more reliable classification performance compared to serial sections of the same specimens stained with H&E. This is because pancytokeratin isolates and highlights the morphology of epithelial components while excluding structures that do not express pathological relevance in the form of morphologic complexity (i.e. connective tissue components). Thus, all TMA sections were stained using Ventana Benchmark LT. Protease 1 antigen retrieval was utilized and followed by Ventana pre-diluted pan-cytokeratin antibody (cat. No. 760-2135) with an incubation time of 32 minutes.",0
14,7,"The TMA cores were examined using an optical microscope (Zeiss Axioscope) with a 10× objective and imaged with an AxioCam HR digital camera (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) at the camera's native resolution of 1300 × 1030 pixels. The AxioCam HR has pixels of size 6.7 μm × 6.7 μm, which are 1.06 μm × 1.06 μm in apparent size at the combined magnifications of 10× objective and 0.63× C-mount optical coupling. The acquired images were saved in tagged image file format (tif).",0
14,8,"Fractal dimension differs from traditional dimension in that it can be a non-integer value. The more complex the form of an object, the higher its fractal dimension compared to its topological dimension (refer to Figure 1). Fractal dimension measures the degree of structural complexity by evaluating changes in detail level as the structure is viewed at different scales [19]. This makes it well-suited for describing asymmetrical structures that maintain a constant level of complexity across various scales.",0
14,9,"The morphologic complexity of breast epithelium, a pathologically relevant histological feature, was quantified using an automated fractal analysis technique that was previously developed [18]. To summarize, the technique involves the following steps:",0
14,10,"The tissue specimens are treated with a histological stain to emphasize and isolate the histological structures of concern, such as the outlines of multi-cellular structures (gland formations), individual cell shapes, and sub-cellular structures (distribution of keratin within the cells and nuclear shape).",0
14,11,The stained specimens were acquired and their background was corrected by capturing a "blank" image under the same imaging conditions as the TMA images. The non-uniform background luminance was subtracted using the "blank" image [18]. The resulting background corrected images were then converted to grey-scale (Figure 2).,0
14,12,"The grey-scale version of the image specimen is converted into a series of binary images by applying a series of intensity thresholds. Histological morphology outlines are then derived from these images, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 provides a closer look at a magnified region of Figure 2A, highlighting the segmented morphology outlines in greater detail.",0
14,13,"Apply the box counting method (with a spatial scale range of 10 to 50 μm) to determine the fractal dimension of each outline image obtained in step 3. [19, 20]",0
14,14,The fractal dimension of the pathological morphology can be identified by determining the global maximum point on a plot of fractal dimension against intensity threshold.,0
14,15,"In our prior study, we demonstrated that our approach for determining the fractal dimension remains constant despite alterations to microscope lighting or variations in stain uniformity and intensity [18]. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the fractal dimension remains unchanged when the magnification is adjusted, as long as the specimen image's field of view maintains the scale range of the structures of interest over which the fractal dimension was established.",0
14,16,"Our fractal analysis method was performed on a total of 1224 TMA cores, with 3 cores taken from each of the 408 patient samples. The TMA core with the greatest fractal dimension was chosen for statistical analysis to avoid the possibility that other cores from the same patient contained only benign or highly differentiated tissue. By selecting the core with the highest fractal dimension, we anticipated it would be representative of the most malignant neoplasm with the greatest deviation from normal cellular/glandular breast morphology, indicating abnormal and/or aggressive tumor growth with potential for metastasis.",0
14,17,"Of the 408 patients, fractal dimension was successfully measured in at least one of the three TMA cores for 92.9% (379) of them. The remaining 29 patients' specimens could not be assessed due to insufficient staining or folding. Eight of those 29 patients had all three TMA cores result in a blank slide. Overall, 9.5% (36), 27.7% (105), and 62.8% (238) of patients had one, two, and three evaluable cores, respectively.",0
14,18,"It can be helpful to convert a measured variable into a categorical variable to assign patients to different risk categories for analysis purposes. Since the fractal analysis technique used in this study is new and there are no standard cutpoints to follow, different methods can be used to determine them, such as biological, data-oriented, or outcome-oriented approaches. However, there is no consensus on which method is the best. In this study, the data-oriented method was applied, and two cutpoints were chosen based on the fractal dimension data. One cutpoint was set at the upper quartile (75th percentile) of the data, and the other was set at the median of the remaining lower three-quarters of the data. Using two cutpoints, rather than one, helps to evaluate whether there is a graded association between fractal dimension and patient prognosis.",0
14,19,"Associations between fractal dimension scores grouped into categories and clinicopathological variables were evaluated for statistical significance with a chi-square test. To determine statistical significance, Kaplan-Meier methods were utilized to calculate the 10-year disease-specific and overall survival rates, and the logrank test was used to compare the curves. Disease-specific survival was measured from the time of cancer diagnosis until the date of death from cancer or last follow-up. Overall survival was measured from the date of cancer diagnosis until the date of death from any cause or the last follow-up. The above statistical analyses were replicated using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling to determine whether any of the clinicopathological variables affected the results. The proportional assumption was tested for all covariates using Log-Minus-Log Survival Plots, and no violations of the assumption were observed. SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute Inc) was utilized to perform the statistical analyses.",0
14,20,"The area under the curve (AUC) from a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to quantify the prognostic accuracy of fractal dimension in predicting death from breast cancer and death from any cause. The AUC values ranged from 0.5 (chance accuracy) to 1.0 (perfect accuracy), with intermediate benchmarks of 0.6 (fair), 0.7 (good), 0.8 (excellent), and 0.9 (almost perfect). The predicted probability of outcome from a Cox regression model was considered as a continuum for the analysis, while the actual occurrence of outcome was used as the comparative standard.",0
14,21,"A method of split-sample cross-validation was applied to determine how well the findings could be applied to other populations. The initial population consisted of 379 patients and was randomly divided into two groups, one for training and the other for validation, with 190 and 189 patients, respectively. A regression equation was developed using the training set and the AUC was estimated by comparing the observed and predicted results. The predicted values for the validation set were then determined using the regression coefficients obtained from the training set, and the AUC was again calculated. The difference between the AUCs for the training and validation sets was used to obtain the shrinkage coefficient, which provides a measure of confidence in the generalization of the results. While there are no clear-cut standards for what constitutes an ideal shrinkage coefficient, lower values are preferred. The data from both sets were combined and a final regression equation was obtained based on the entire sample once an acceptable shrinkage coefficient was achieved.",0
14,22,"Instead of excluding patients with missing data, which numbered 15 for tumor grades, 4 for lymph node status, 15 for estrogen-receptor status, and 12 for HER-2/neu status out of 379 evaluable patients, the predicted mean approach in SOLAS 3.0 software was used to impute the data. This allowed for a larger sample size and any imputation bias was assessed by re-running the analysis without including any patients with missing data. The results were similar, so the analysis was reported with the imputed data.",0
14,23,"The fractal dimension scores ranged from 1.08 to 1.97, with a median of 1.62, lower quartile of 1.49, and upper quartile of 1.75. The cores were moderately related with an intraclass correlation of 0.51. Two cutpoints were selected using a data-oriented approach; fractal dimension values below 1.56 were considered low (N = 141), 1.56-1.75 as intermediate (N = 148), and above 1.75 as high (N = 90). Representative TMA cores from these fractal dimension categories are shown in Figure 2, which depicts the increasing complexity of outline morphology in the low, intermediate, and high fractal dimension categories (A-C).",0
14,24,"Table 1 displays the baseline patient features. Greater fractal dimension correlated significantly with traditional poorer prognosis indicators, such as advanced age, larger tumor size, higher tumor grade, and positive lymph node status. Nonetheless, fractal dimension did not associate with either estrogen receptor status or HER-2/neu status.",0
14,25,"The patients were followed up for a median of 5.2 years. The disease-specific and overall survival rates for the entire group of 379 patients were 52.5% and 42.5%, respectively, after 10 years. Patients with higher fractal scores had worse disease-specific survival than those with lower scores (25.0% versus 56.4% versus 69.4%, p < 0.001; Table 2 and Figure 4A). Additionally, patients with higher scores had worse overall survival (14.2% versus 39.9% versus 67.4%, p < 0.001; Table 2 and Figure 4B). The prognostic accuracy of fractal dimension was good, with AUCs of 0.66 and 0.67 for univariate disease-specific and overall survival, respectively. Older age, higher grade, and positive lymph node status predicted worse outcomes, but not the size of the tumour, estrogen-receptor status, or HER-2/neu status (Table 2).",0
14,26,"The tumour grade was determined using reports from 10 to 30 certified cancer pathologists. Despite a clear separation in disease-specific survival for different fractal dimensions (shown in Figure 4A), there was significant overlap in survival curves for grade 1 and 2 tumours over the entire 10-year follow-up period (see Figure 4C). Additionally, the overall survival curves for grades 1 and 2 were nearly identical for the first four years following diagnosis (Figure 4D). These findings indicate that tumour grade 1 and 2 cannot accurately predict outcomes for patients over the course of 10 years.",0
14,27,"Results from the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indicate that fractal dimension remains a noteworthy prognostic indicator even after adjustment for all clinicopathological variables (as seen in Table 3). Despite the smaller multivariate hazard ratio (Table 3) relative to the univariate hazard ratio (Table 2), this finding implies that fractal dimension is a robust prognostic factor. The AUCs for the 7-factor regression models highlight that fractal dimension continues to be a strong predictor of disease-specific and overall survival, with little contribution to prognostic accuracy from the other clinical-pathological factors. It is worth noting that even when comparing the combined grades of 1 and 2 to grade 3 tumors, fractal dimension remained significantly more strongly associated with both disease-specific and overall survival.",0
14,28,"'The study used split-sample cross-validation to evaluate the generalizability of the results outlined in the statistical analysis section. Table 4 shows that the results from both sets align with each other as well as the complete sample, including similar frequency distributions and 10-year survival rates across low, moderate, and high fractal dimension categories. The study discovered that higher levels of fractal dimension doubled the hazards, which remained consistent even with smaller sample sizes. Both disease-specific and overall survival had negative shrinkage coefficients of -0.01 and -0.05, respectively. As a result, the researchers concluded that fractal dimension is generalizable and that it was acceptable to combine data from both sets in the analysis.'",0
14,29,"We developed a method to measure the morphologic complexity of epithelial architecture and found a direct association between fractal dimension and breast tumour grade. In this study, we analyzed specimens from patients with invasive breast cancer and found that fractal dimension showed a stronger association with disease-specific survival than standard clinical prognosticators. This is the largest and only study of its kind investigating a positive association between breast epithelial architecture and patient outcome. Fractal dimension has potential advantages over conventional tumour grading as a quantitative and reproducible indicator, providing pathologists with rapid and cost-effective analysis from as few as three TMA cores per patient.",0
14,30,"Studies examining the prognostic value of potential factors should ideally only include patients who have not yet undergone systemic therapy. However, this is becoming increasingly challenging because adjuvant therapy is now recommended for a wider range of breast cancer patients. This particular study did not involve the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, but all patients received adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, regardless of their ER status. Even though this may affect the results, it is expected that the fractal dimension will be independent of the tamoxifen therapy since all patients received the same treatment. The results seem to support this since the percentage of patients with low, intermediate, and high fractal dimension is similar across ER-positive groups, suggesting that tamoxifen therapy has put all patients with ER-positive breast cancer on an equal footing.",0
14,31,"Fractal analysis has previously been used to characterize cancer, and some studies have shown that fractal dimension can describe the complex structures seen in some cancers. However, this study is the largest and only one to relate fractal dimension of epithelial architecture to patient outcome. Although an external patient validation set was not used in this proof of principle study, a data-oriented approach was used to minimize bias in cutpoint selection, and a cross-validation analysis was conducted, suggesting the results are generalizable. Higher fractal dimensions were associated with a poorer outcome, indicating the potential of fractal dimension as an image-based prognostic marker. This is consistent with the idea that malignant breast neoplasms demonstrate a lack of structural organization and functional coordination with surrounding normal tissue. Additionally, changes in the morphological complexity of architectural components of a neoplasm that arise from changes in the functional status of cells can be quantified using fractal analysis.",0
14,32,"The results of this retrospective study suggest that fractal dimension is a promising image analysis marker for predicting the prognosis of IDC of the breast. However, external validation studies and controlled prospective clinical trials are needed to confirm its prognostic value. To further investigate its potential, future work will examine the use of fractal dimension to define risk categories for Stage I, lymph node-negative and tumour size ≤ 2 cm in maximum diameter, ER-positive breast cancer patients who have not received adjuvant systemic therapy. Additionally, these studies will explore the combination of fractal dimension with a quantitative analysis of mitotic count to validate the significance of morphologic complexity of epithelial architecture in node-negative breast cancer, and examine the synergy between morphologic complexity and cellular proliferation.",0

Various data points were collected, including the number of remaining teeth, length of time since tooth loss, health-related lifestyles, and medical history. Additionally, physical measurements such as blood pressure, height, and body weight were taken, along with fasting blood samples. Through this cross-sectional study, the goal was to compare the number of remaining teeth and duration of tooth loss in subjects with MMI or a low MMSE score against those in a control group of elderly individuals.",0

16,8,"The dental exam involved two dentists trained in the same techniques, with both the dentist and patient seated and under artificial lighting. The number of teeth and their condition were recorded, excluding teeth marked for extraction or root tips. The age of edentulous patients was also recorded along with the Community Periodontal Index code. The upper and lower teeth were divided into segments, and ten representative teeth in six segments were examined and assigned a code between 0 and 4 based on their condition. Ineligible segments had one or no remaining teeth.",0
16,9,"The participants were queried regarding their alcohol consumption habits, including the frequency of drinking, the type of alcohol consumed, and the average daily intake. They were also asked about their smoking history and daily walking time in a self-administered questionnaire which was further confirmed by an interview. Moreover, the researchers interviewed each participant to determine any impairment of their daily activities, such as eating, dressing and walking. The presence of any medical history, including diseases such as cancer, cerebrovascular disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension was also recorded. The participants' blood pressure was then measured twice at 30-second intervals using an automatic blood-pressure manometer after resting quietly for over five minutes. The device displayed results from the Korotkoff method.",0
16,10,"Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the control group with the MMI group and the low MMSE score group. The significance level was set based on the Bonferroni test. The Mantel-extension method was utilized to identify any correlation between the number of remaining teeth, CPI, and the prevalence of MMI or low MMSE scores. Logistic regression analysis was performed using depressive symptoms, sex, age, length of education, and other independent variables. The number of remaining teeth and the length of time after becoming edentulous were used as continuous and categorical variables in separate models. The Hosmer and Lemeshow technique was employed to evaluate goodness of fit. SPSS (version 17.0) was used for all statistical analyses. The P values were calculated for all the analyses, and the level of significance was set at 0.05.",0
16,11,"The process for subject selection is illustrated in Figure 1. Out of the 4,206 participants who underwent examination, we excluded 145 individuals with severe visual or hearing impairments that could affect cognitive function tests. After removing these participants, 214 out of the remaining 4,061 individuals had low MMSE scores (i.e., 23 or lower). To ensure that our remaining sample reflected individuals with independence in basic and instrumental ADL skills, we interviewed the remaining 3,847 participants who scored 24 or higher on the MMSE. Their Recall scores were used to categorize 151 participants as low-scoring (score of 1 or 0) and 3,696 as high-scoring (score of 3 or 2) control group participants. We additionally excluded 30 participants from the low-scoring group who displayed signs of depression based on GDS scores of 6 or more, as this could lead to pseudo-dementia. Thus, the final analysis consisted of 3,696 control group participants, 121 participants with MMI scores, and 214 participants with low MMSE scores. This was a cross-sectional study.",0
16,12,"Table 1 displays the demographic traits of the participants. Significant differences in factors, as determined by the Bonferroni test, were observed between the control group and the MMI group or those with low MMSE scores. These factors include depressive symptoms, age, gender, length of education, remaining teeth count, alcohol consumption of at least once a week, smoking, daily walking time, serum albumin levels, total cholesterol levels, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.",0
16,13,"The prevalence of MMI or a low MMSE score is illustrated in Figure 2. The remaining teeth were divided into three categories - 22-32, 11-21, and 0-10. No significant dose-response relationship was observed in a trend test between the number of remaining teeth and MMI prevalence. However, individuals with 0-10 remaining teeth had a higher MMI prevalence than those with 22-32 remaining teeth. The prevalence of a low MMSE score increased in both age categories as the number of remaining teeth decreased. A significant increase in prevalence was observed in a trend test (P < 0.001). The CPI code did not show a significant dose-response relationship with MMI or low MMSE prevalence. This is shown in Figure 2's lower panel.",0
16,14,"We used multivariate adjusted odds ratios (Table 2) to determine if the presence of fewer remaining teeth was independently associated with MMI or a low MMSE score status. We only used factors with a calculated P value < 0.05 between the control and MMI groups or between the control and low MMSE score groups in Table 1. After adjusting for variables in the full models, we found a significant relationship between the number of remaining teeth (per 1 decrease) and MMI (odds ratio: 1.021, 95% CI: 1.001-1.041), and a low MMSE score (odds ratio: 1.039, 95% CI: 1.0231.054). Moreover, the odds ratio of having 0-10 remaining teeth to 22-32 remaining teeth was 1.679 (95% CI: 1.073-2.627) for MMI and 2.177 (95% CI: 1.510-3.140) for a low MMSE score.",0
16,15,"Among individuals who were edentulous, the median age at which they became edentulous and the prevalence of those who were edentulous for 15 years or more were compared between control, MMI, and low MMSE score groups. The results showed significant differences between the control and low MMSE score groups. After adjusting for multiple variables, the odds ratios for a low MMSE score were found to be higher for both ""per 1 year increase"" and ""15 years or more.""",0
16,16,"The study conducted within the community inferred that a decrease in the number of remaining teeth was linked with a significant rise in the occurrence of a low MMSE score. The results were confirmed after considering other explanatory factors, affirming the association between the decrease in the number of remaining teeth and low MMSE score. These findings were in line with earlier reports that showed the connection between tooth loss and reduced cognitive function. Furthermore, the study showed that a decrease in the number of remaining teeth was linked with the risk of MMI.",0
16,17,"The present study has several limitations that require consideration. Firstly, the data were obtained from a cross-sectional study, preventing us from making definitive conclusions about the biological credibility of the effect of tooth loss on MMI and a low MMSE score. Secondly, we did not explore the timing or causes of tooth loss. The severity of periodontal disease could have been more accurately assessed if we had examined markers of inflammation in the gingival crevicular fluid or alveolar bone loss measurements, rather than using the CPI code. Thirdly, our identification criteria for MMI differed from those established by Ishikawa, as we employed MMSE and GDS screening tests to identify the absence of dementia or depression. Nonetheless, the prevalence of MMI in our study was similar to that of Japanese community-based MCI. Finally, we did not genotype for APOE, which has been linked to dementia in Japanese-American men.",0
16,18,"The relationship between tooth loss and a low MMSE score can be explained by the fact that older adults with a low MMSE score tend to not frequently use dental services. Furthermore, individuals with dementia tend to have increased plaque accumulation. It is possible that other biological factors besides dental health deterioration caused by cognitive impairment contribute to the relationship between tooth loss, MMI, and a low MMSE score, as evidenced by the significant association between tooth loss and MMI subjects who retain their basic and instrumental ADL.",0
16,19,"Four additional potential biological explanations can be suggested for the correlation between tooth loss and cognitive function. To begin with, systemic inflammation resulting from periodontal disease, a leading cause of tooth extraction in the elderly, may link to cognitive function through cytokines that cross the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, periodontal disease and cognitive function have been linked to genetic risk factors, such as an interleukin 1 gene polymorphism. Tooth loss may also result in a decrease in the number of periodontal mechanoreceptors, which are sensory receptors, causing a memory and learning disorder. Despite animal models indicating functional deterioration of the cholinergic neuronal system and a negative impact on the number of tyrosine kinase B mRNA-positive cells with the duration of tooth loss and number of extracted teeth, it is important to conduct further research.",0
16,20,"A meaningful correlation was established between the duration of being without teeth and the likelihood of receiving a low MMSE score, even after accounting for their age during the initial examination and other factors (refer to Table 3). AD was more prone to occur in those who had ""lost all teeth or lost half of teeth before age 35"" [3]. While no significant link was observed, the MMI group had a more elevated occurrence of those who had been edentulous for 15 years or more (50.0%) versus the control group (34.4%). As a result, losing teeth may cumulatively harm the brain.",0
16,21,"There was a significant correlation between the number of remaining teeth and the risk of MMI and a low MMSE score, but no significant correlation between the CPI code, MMI, and a low MMSE score was found. Table 1 and Figure 2 illustrate this. The CPI underestimates the relationship between cognitive function and the cumulative burden of periodontal disease. Tooth loss or periodontal disease could be related to cognitive function because the prevalence of ""Ineligible for CPI"" was higher and ""Code 0, 1, or 2"" was lower in the MMI and low MMSE score groups than in the control group.",0
16,22,"The length of the edentulous period and the number of remaining teeth were found to have a significant correlation with cognitive function. Although APOE genotyping data was not available, this cross-sectional study implies a noteworthy association between tooth loss and MMI as well as cognitive impairment. Additional research is necessary to explore the precise factors that contribute to this connection.",0
18,1,"Breast cancer is a common cancer in women that poses a threat to their health. According to Al-Hajj's research in 2003, breast cancer stem cells with self-renewal and multi-directional differentiation properties (ESA+CD44+CD24-/low, BCSCs) are the primary contributors to drug resistance, recurrence, and metastasis of breast cancer. Previous studies have also identified that breast cancer stem cells possess an ESA+CD44+CD24-/low phenotype. This study is based on these findings and further confirms them. Research on BCSCs is expected to bring revolutionary changes in our understanding of breast cancer; however, several issues related to the molecular basis of carcinogenesis remain unresolved. We need to investigate the full nature of BCSCs' involvement in the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis, including the role of microRNAs (miRNAs).",0
18,2,"miRNAs, a crucial type of regulatory noncoding RNAs, have an essential function in the committed differentiation and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. The most recent miRBase release (10.0) contains 5071 miRNA loci from 58 unique species. miRNAs can either act as oncogenes or anti-oncogenes and are associated with the growth of various types of tumors, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, paediatric Burkitt’s lymphoma, gastric cancer, lung cancer and large-cell lymphoma. In humans, miRNAs (1048 sequences in miRBase 16, Sep 10th, 2010) regulate more than one-third of all genes, bringing hope to studies of cancer stem cells. Therefore, the identification of cancer stem cell-related miRNAs would provide valuable information for a better understanding of cancer stem cell properties and the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis. To explore this, the miRNA expression profiles of ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/low BCSCs were probed from the MCF-7 cell line.",0
18,3,"The minimal essential medium (MEM) from Invitrogen (America) was used to culture the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. Cells in log phase were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin from Gibco (America), washed with PBS, and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-ESA, APC-conjugated anti-CD44, and PE-conjugated anti-CD24 from BD PharMingen (America). After a 30-minute incubation, the cells were washed thrice, and FACS (MoFlo, America) was performed to isolate the ESA+CD44+CD24-/low cells.",0
18,4,"The ESA+CD44+CD24-/low lineage- cells that had been isolated were suspended in MEM supplemented with 1% FBS and were rinsed twice using the same medium. After that, EpiCult™-B medium (Stemcell Technologies, Canada) fortified with 5% FBS was used to replace the medium. Next, NIH/3T3 feeder cells that had been exposed to 60 Co at 50 Gy were seeded onto 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 10^4 cells or 1 × 10^4 BCSCs. The mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line NIH/3T3 was cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen). After 24 hours of seeding, the medium was changed again to serum-free EpiCult™-B medium for the cells and they were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37°C. Fresh medium was given to the cells every 3 days, and colonies appeared under a microscope after 7-10 days.",0
18,5,"Female NOD/SCID mice aged eight weeks were subjected to 2.5 Gy of 60Co radiation, after which tumor cell injections were conducted one day later. The tumor cells were suspended in 0.2 ml of IMDM, which contained 10% FBS, and were then injected into the left armpit's mammary fat pad. The test group received injections of 0.5 x 10^3, 1 x 10^3, 5 x 10^3, 1 x 10^4, or 5 x 10^4 ESA+CD44+CD24-/low cells that were segregated via FACS. Meanwhile, the control group mice were given injections of 1 x 10^4, 5 x 10^4, 1 x 10^5, 5 x 10^5, or 1 x 10^6 MCF-7 cells. Each group was given three mice, which were inoculated with the same number of cells. Over eight weeks, the mice were tracked for tumor growth every ten days, after which they were euthanized through cervical dislocation. A single-cell suspension was obtained as per a previously published protocol, after which ESA+CD44+CD24-/low cells were removed from the xenograft tumor cells via FACS and injected into the mammary fat pad, as had previously been described. The Third Military Medical University's Animal Ethics Committee approved all animal procedures.",0
18,6,"Tissue slides of the tumor were made ready for immunohistochemistry using already published protocol [9] and the markers of the luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells, which are Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and smooth muscle actin (SMA) respectively, for the immunostaining. Anti-EMA or anti-SMA antibodies, that were rabbit polyclonal and diluted to 1:500, were used, and Santa Cruz of CA provided them.",0
18,7,"The process of making and testing miRNA microarrays was conducted according to methods previously reported [9]. The microarray utilized in this study consisted of 517 mature miRNA series and 122 predicted miRNA (Pred_miR) series from published sources [10]. Each sample was tested twice, with three identical miRNA probes on the microarray for each test. The SAM method (version 2.1) was employed for the microarray data analysis, using a two class unpaired comparison approach.",0
18,8,"The primers used in this study were designed with Primer Express version 2.0, following the protocol by Chen et al. [11] for primer design and realtime RT-PCR. For the internal control, the primers 5’-ctcgcttcggcagcaca-3’ and 5’-aacgcttcacgaatttgcgt-3’ were designed for the U6 small nuclear RNA. The miRNAs analysed in this study included miR-122a, miR-188, miR-200a, miR-21, miR-224, miR-296, miR-301, miR-31, miR-373*, and miR-200C.",0

18,10,"The flow cytometry analysis was used to evaluate the expression of ESA, CD44 and CD24 in MCF-7 cells. A small percentage of lineage-negative ESA+ CD44+ CD24-/low cells were identified and isolated through FACS sorting with high purity. The clonogenic potential of these BCSCs was evaluated through culturing them on irradiated NIH/3T3 feeder cells. The cells formed epithelioid colonies within 3-6 days and continued to expand over time. The ESA+ CD44+ CD24-/low cells exhibited no distinct morphological characteristics compared to MCF-7 cells. A detailed account of these findings is provided in Figure 1.",0
18,11,"We subcutaneously injected ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/low cells and MCF-7 cells (as a control) into the armpits of NOD/SCID mice. Following 8 weeks, MCF-7 cells formed new tumors only when ≥5 × 10^5 cells were administered, failing to do so at lower doses (1 × 10^5 cells). In contrast, ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/low cells formed tumors in three of three, three of three, and one of three animals when 5 × 10^4, 1 × 10^4, and 5 × 10^3 cells were injected, respectively. Tumor specimens were collected and passaged into recipient mice, with tumors forming in three of three, three of three, and two of three recipient animals when 5 × 10^4, 1 × 10^4, and 5 × 10^3 cells were administered, respectively. One of three animals in the control group displayed tumors when administered 5 × 10^5 cells, but 5 × 10^4 -1 × 10^5 cells did not generate tumors in the control group (Table 1 Figure 1C). These findings suggest that ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/low cells have a significant tumorigenic potential and are capable of initiating tumors up to 100- to 1000-fold more efficiently than MCF-7 cells.",0
18,12,"The variability of ESA+CD44+/CD24- subpopulation in the murine model was tested through FACS analysis. The unsorted MCF-7 xenografts showed a constant occurrence of 1-2%, while the sorted MCF-7 xenografts exhibited a significant increase in the subpopulation, reaching 4-5%.",0
18,13,"Tissue slides from the tumors were made and subjected to H&E and immunohistochemical staining. The BCSCs tumors showed positive results for both EMA and SMA, indicating the presence of luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Meanwhile, the MCF-7 control group tumors only showed positive results for EMA, suggesting the presence of luminal epithelial cells but not myoepithelial cells (see Figure 2).",0
18,14,"The hybridisation reaction was conducted twice for each type of cell. The U6 snRNA internal controls on all microarrays produced consistent signal strength, and the signal intensity of all detected spots on replicate microarrays showed high R values (R = 0.9747 ± 0.0304), indicating reliable hybridisation between the replicas (see Additional file 1 Figure S1). In total, 147 miRNAs were identified in MCF-7 cells and 102 miRNAs in BCSCs, including predicted miRNAs (PRED_MIR) with a signal value above 800. Out of the 41 miRNAs reported by Ambion in its MCF-7 cell miRNA expression profile (signal value ≥++), 34 were also detected in this study, demonstrating a concordance rate of 82.9% (see Additional file 1 Table S1 S2 & S3). Utilizing a normalization factor and clustering, we compared the miRNA expression profiles of BCSCs and MCF-7 cells, identifying 25 differentially expressed miRNAs that fell into two groups (fold change ≥ 4) using a p-value cutoff of less than 0.05.",0

MiR-200C served as the negative control, but it showed no notable difference. The experiments were conducted three times, and eight of the ten tested miRNAs showed concordant results with the microarray data. The electrophoretogram also showed evident and precise bands for the real-time PCR reactions. The Q-RT-PCR results were expressed as the relative ratio between the Q-RT-PCR results for BCSCs and MCF-7 cells, which confirmed the miRNA expression profiles of BCSCs.",0
18,16,"The miRNAs were analyzed through various online software programs, including chromosome localization, sequence analysis, and target prediction. Potential miRNAs related to tumorigenesis and their targets were identified, many of which were oncogenes, anti-oncogenes, or regulatory genes involved in various biological functions such as miRNA processing, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, apoptosis regulation, and stem cell function. For instance, one of the miRNAs, miR122a, had 161 potential targets consisting of oncogenes, transcription factors, DNA repair-related genes, miRNA processing-related genes, and signal transduction-related genes such as RAD21, G3BP2, CDC42BPB, SP2, GPR172B, GPR172A, MAP3K3, DR1, KHDRBS1, MAP3K12, CCNG1, and DICER1. Another miRNA, miR-21, located on chromosome 17, had 175 potential targets, including pleiomorphic adenoma genes, transcription factors, oncogenes, anti-oncogenes, and genes related to miRNA processing and signal transduction, such as PLAG1, PDCD4, SKI, BCL2, STAT3, PITX2, HBP1, ELF2, E2F3, SPRY1, CDC25A, N-PAC, EIF1AX, EIF2C2, RAB11A, RAB6A, RAB6C, RASGRP1, RHOB, RASA1, TPM1, TGFBI, and TNFSF6. These potential targets existed exclusively in humans, mice, dogs, chimps, and chickens (Additional file 1 table S4).",0
18,25,"We conducted a study to examine the miRNA expression profile of ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/Low BCSCs taken from the MCF-7 cell line. The discovery of miRNAs associated with BCSCs can serve as a basis for further exploration of their functions, providing new insights into the complex nature of BCSCs. It may also aid cancer researchers and clinical oncologists in developing and testing innovative therapeutic methods.",0
