1,1,"Neurogenesis is a regulated process that maintains the complex structure of the central nervous system. In adults, neurogenesis is a form of neural plasticity as it continuously generates new neurons from neural stem cells. This process involves several steps, including proliferation, restriction of precursors to neuronal lineages, cell cycle exit, migration and integration into target areas, differentiation, as well as morphological and functional maturation. At the end of this process, newly generated cells become functionally active neurons. These cells can be identified by their expression of doublecortin (DCX), which is mainly detected in the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the subventricular zone/rostral migration stream/olfactory bulb axis. Transgenic mice have been generated to monitor neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo by driving reporter genes with the DCX promoter.",0
1,2,"The need to better understand adult neurogenesis at the molecular and cellular levels in order to develop therapeutic strategies for pathological neuronal losses has been emphasized. There is also accumulating evidence that abnormal neurogenesis could play a role in neuropsychiatric disorders. Various models have been created over the years, such as transgenic models utilizing cell-type specific promoters (nestin, GLAST, PLP, DCX) to research the biology of neural stem cells, radial glia, oligodendroglial precursors and neuronal precursors. However, these reporter mice have limitations for long-term studies such as fate tracing or assessing the long-term functional integration of newly generated neurons. For instance, the DCX reporter mice are not suitable for fate mapping studies in regions such as the SVZ/OB axis or the dentate gyrus since DCX expression is temporary (mostly less than 1 month in rodents).",0
1,3,"To solve the issue of lacking a proper tool for studying neuronal precursor fate, we created transgenic mice that have the CreERT2 recombinase gene controlled by the DCX promoter and can be induced by tamoxifen. We show that this new transgenic tool enables the labeling of newly-formed neurons and tracking of their fate over a long period. Additionally, it allows for the regulation of gene expression during an important period of neuronal development and the analysis of the functional impact of such regulation.",0
1,4,"The CreERT2 cDNA from the 2380-bp Sal I-Not I fragment of pCAG-CreERT2bpA-SS1 vector was subcloned into the BamH I and Not I site of the phuDCX-3509-DsRed2 cassette which has the promoter region of human DCX resulting in phuDCX-3509-CreERT2 (Additional file 1). In addition, a 7.7-kb DCX-3'UTR was amplified using RT-PCR with specific primers and cloned into a pCRII vector to obtain the pCRIITOPO-3'UTR plasmid. Next, a 7.7-kb Spe I-Not I fragment of pCRII-TOPO-3'UTR was further subcloned into the Spe I and Not I site of the phuDCX-3509-CreERT2 cassette to obtain the phuDCX-3509-CreERT2-3'UTR targeting plasmid.",0
1,5,"The plasmid used for targeting, phuDCX-3509-CreERT2-3’-UTR, underwent linearization via Sal I-Not I digestion. The DNA was then injected into the pronuclei of fertilized oocytes from FVB inbred mice. PCR analysis and Southern Blot of tail DNA were utilized to determine the genotypes of the offspring. Cre-positive mice were further analyzed with Southern Blot using a 1.27-kb Sal I-Hind III fragment of pCAG-CreERT2-bpA-SS1 vector as a probe. If there were positive insertions, a 7424 bp fragment would be detected after digestion of genomic DNA with Kpn I or two fragments would be detected after digestion with EcoR V. All restriction enzymes used were from Roche Applied Science.",0
1,6,"Animal experiments were conducted following the guidelines of the Council of European Communities Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC) and approved by the HelmholtzZentrum Munich Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The research team expanded the DCXCreERT2 transgenic mouse line by breeding DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice with wildtype C57Bl/6J mice. Additionally, DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice were mated with two reporter lines - CAG-CAT-EGFP mice [22] or ROSA26lacZ mice [23] - to produce DCX-CreERT2: ROSA26lacZ or DCX-CreERT2:CAG-CAT-EGFP double transgenic mice. By inducing recombination activity in these lines, the expression of the corresponding reporter gene was activated, and this was used for the different analyses described later.",0
1,7,"Tamoxifen was mixed with corn oil to create a 10 mg/ml stock concentration. Pregnant mice were injected with 20 μg TAM/g bodyweight to analyze expression of certain genes in embryos. The same protocol was used in pregnant mice of 17.5 day gestational stage to study the fate of targeted cells during adulthood. To test the activation of CreERT2 recombination in adult brains, 200 μg TAM/g bodyweight was injected. Daily injections of 100 μg TAM/g bodyweight were used to study the expression patterns of genes and markers in adult brains, with mice analyzed at different time points after the last injection.",0
1,8,"The mice received an injection of BrdU (5-Bromo-2’deoxyuridine) in sterile PBS, pH7.4, 24 hours before perfusion. The dosage was 200 μg/g bodyweight. The BrdU was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and prepared appropriately.",0
1,9,"For whole-mount X-gal staining, embryos were immersed in a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2 in PBS, and fixed for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT). After that, they were rinsed in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 (PB), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% NP-40, and incubated with X-gal staining buffer (0.1% X-gal, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% NP-40, 5 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mM K4Fe(CN)6 in PB) in the dark at 37°C for several hours, to visualize the beta-galactosidase (b-gal) activity as a blue reaction product. The stained embryos were then washed twice in PBS and post-fixed with 4% PFA in PBS, overnight at 4°C. For the X-gal staining of free-floating sections, the process was the same as before, except the sections were post-fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for only 1 hour at RT, and then lightly counterstained with Eosin Y (0.1%, E4382, Sigma-Aldrich).",0
1,10,"Embryonic specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer with a pH of 7.5 for a duration of 2-8 hours. The whole embryo was embedded in paraffin and sectioned sagittally (8 μm) with the use of a Microm HM 355 s Microtome (Leica). Adult mouse brains were extracted post transcardial perfusion with 4% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.5. These brains were postfixed for 2 hours in the same fixative, submerged in 20% sucrose at 4°C overnight, and embedded in OCT compound. Leica cryostats were used to cut serial coronal or sagittal sections (40 μm) of the brain for systematic sampling of the entire structure.",0
1,11,"For immunofluorescence staining, the free-floating sections were initially washed with PBS and then blocked with PBS++ (PBS++ includes 5% fetal calf serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for one hour at room temperature. However, in cases where the detection of BrdU was necessary, the sections were treated with 2 N HCl for 30 minutes at 37°C, neutralized for 10 minutes in 0.1 M borate buffer, washed six times in PBS, and then blocked with PBS++. After blocking, the sections were exposed to primary antibody dilutions (given in Table 1) in PBS++ for 24 hours at 4°C, followed by three 10-minute washes in PBS. The sections were then treated with secondary antibody conjugated to cyanine 2 (cy2), cy3 or cy5 in PBS++ for two hours at room temperature in a 1:400 dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab). After three 10-minute washes in PBS, the sections were treated with 5 mg/ml 4’,6’-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (SigmaAldrich, D9564) for 20 minutes, followed by three 5-minute washes in PBS. Finally, the sections were mounted using Aqua poly/Mount (Polysciences, 18606).",0
1,12,The number of recombination events was quantified by counting at least 100 positive cells per region of interest for each animal and time point. The presented data show the mean ± SD.,0
1,13,"The ability of a 3509-bp DCX genomic fragment to drive expression of reporter genes in neuronal precursors and immature neurons in vitro and in vivo was previously demonstrated (9,10). Hence, the CreERT2 encoding sequences were subcloned downstream of this DCX regulatory fragment (Additional file 1). After pronuclear injection, two male founders carrying the CreERT2 transgene were obtained. Both founders transmitted their transgene to the F1 generation, and Southern blot analysis indicated that only 1 copy of the transgene was integrated into the host genome (Additional file 1).",0
1,14,"Cre-recombinase activity was evaluated in the first generation of two founder-derived lines by mating them with Rosa26 lacZ reporter mice. This resulted in activation of a lacZ expression cassette following recombination [23]. Two-month-old DCX-CreERT2:Rosa26 lacZ mice were perfused two weeks after a tamoxifen (TAM) or vehicle injection and stained for b-gal activity. Both DCX-CreERT2 transgenic lines exhibited the expected TAM-induced b-gal expression in adult neurogenic regions, such as the SVZ and dentate gyrus (Additional file 1). However, no b-gal activity was detected following vehicle injections in the progeny derived from founder 2. In contrast, progeny from founder 1 showed numerous b-gal positive profiles after vehicle injection, indicating unspecific recombination events (data not shown). Therefore, only the transgenic DCXCreERT2 founder 2 line was expanded and used for subsequent experiments.",0
1,15,"To confirm that CreERT2 expression matches with the endogenous DCX expression in the DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice, we examined their respective expression patterns. At the level of individual cells, CreERT2 was found in almost all DCX+ cells of the developing CNS (E15.5). Additionally, one day after TAM administration, the CreERT2 had translocated into the nucleus (Figure 1a). Similarly, in the adult brain, CreERT2 expression was exclusively present in the nucleus of DCX+ cells one day after TAM injection (Figure 1b). The nuclear distribution was motivated by TAM administration and is required for CreERT2 activity.",0
1,16,"To determine the timeframe during which CreERT2 operates in the nucleus following the TAM injection, DCX-CreERT2 adult mice were perfused at various points in time after the injection, and the sub-cellular localization of the CreERT2 protein was evaluated. The nuclear localization of CreERT2 was markedly reduced seven days following TAM injection as opposed to the initial day. At this stage, CreERT2 expression was still co-localized with DCX, but the distribution shifted back to being mostly cytoplasmic (Figure 1c). Moreover, two weeks post-TAM injection, CreERT2 was located exclusively in the cytoplasm (Figure 1d and 1e). Our findings suggest that CreERT2 nuclear localization quickly diminishes following the last TAM administration, indicating that CreERT2 activity is transient and practically ceases after seven days.",0
1,17,"After confirming that CreERT2 co-localizes correctly with DCX+ cells, we proceeded to examine the specificity and activity of recombination. We bred DCX-CreERT2 mice with Rosa26 lacZ or CAG-CATEGFP reporter mice to track activation of the relevant reporter gene expression upon successful excision of the loxP-flanked cassette. Analyzing reporter gene expression at different times after recombination allows us to monitor the outcome of DCX-expressing cells.",0
1,18,"After administering TAM injection on E14.5, CreERT2 activity was examined and it was observed that b-gal expression was limited to CNS and DRGs, similar to endogenous DCX expression. On E17.5, activation of CreERT2 by a single TAM-injection resulted in widespread EGFP reporter expression throughout the brain parenchyma, including the granular cell layer of dentate gyrus, striatum, cortex, thalamus, Ammon’s horn (CA1), etc., as per the DCX expression pattern.",0
1,19,"Virtually all cells that expressed EGFP also expressed NeuN which indicates that they had matured into neurons (Figure 2d to 2g). EGFP expression was not found in DCX-positive cells located in the SVZ (Figure 2f and 2g), the RMS (data not shown), or the SGZ of the dentate gyrus (Figure 2d and 2e). Some EGFP+ cells were observed in or near the ependymal layer of the lateral ventricles (Figure 2f, indicated by arrows). However, these EGFP+ cells did not co-express NeuN or DCX, and their identity is still unknown.",0
1,20,"In order to investigate the limited production of neurons in the adult CNS, adult mice were given TAM injections for five consecutive days before being perfused for analysis four weeks after the final injection. The results showed that EGFP+ cells generated in the SVZ reached the OB and were mainly distributed in the GrO layer, with fewer cells found in the pGl layer. These EGFP+ cells in the OB expressed NeuN, indicating maturity, but not DCX. Scattered EGFP+ cells expressing DCX were found in the rostral RMS, while few EGFP+ cells were present in the SVZ. Additionally, EGFP+ cells in the dentate gyrus expressed NeuN and not DCX. (Figure 2h–k).",0
1,21,"The recombination event in cells expressing DCX in the adult SVZ and SGZ was assessed for efficiency and specificity. The proportion of DCX+ cells that expressed EGFP represented efficiency while the percentage of EGFP+ cells that expressed DCX represented specificity. Since EGFP accumulation levels were low initially, an anti-EGFP antibody was used to amplify signals for subsequent experiments. In the SVZ, 94% of DCX+ cells co-expressed EGFP, while in the SGZ, EGFP was detected in 77% of DCX-expressing cells. Additionally, 96% of EGFP+ cells in the SVZ and 90% in the SGZ co-expressed DCX, indicating high efficiency and specificity of CreERT2 activity.",0
1,22,"To further understand how DCX+ cells move from their birthplace to their destination areas, the researchers studied the distribution of cells that expressed EGFP at different time intervals after treatment with TAM. Adult mice were sacrificed on the eighth, fifteenth, and twenty-ninth day after the last injection to investigate the co-localization of EGFP expression with DCX and NeuN in the SVZ-RMS-OB axis and the dentate gyrus.",0
1,23,"The percentage of DCX+ neurons expressing EGFP decreased from 100% at day 2 to 25% at day 15, while co-localization of EGFP and DCX in the SVZ decreased from 26.7% at day 8 to 12.5% at day 15. By day 29, few EGFP+ cells expressing DCX remained in the SVZ and no co-localization was detected in the SGZ. These results suggest that the main migration of EGFP-labeled neurons occurred within the first 15 days. (Figure 3)",0
1,24,"During the migration of EGFP+ cells along the RMS from D2 to D15, they were discovered to have an immature neuronal morphology and only a few instances of co-localization with NeuN were identified (as shown in Figure 4). As the cells arrived at either the GrO or pGl of the olfactory bulb over the next four weeks, there was a general increase in NeuN expression in EGFP+ cells (as demonstrated in Figure 2h and 2i, Figure 4 a, e and 4i). In the GrO, the expression of DCX in EGFP+ cells was weak, while DCX was still highly expressed in the cytoplasm of EGFP+ cells located at the front of the RMS (indicated by the arrow in Figure 2i), indicating that the expression of DCX decreased progressively as EGFP+ cells migrated towards their target regions (data not revealed). These findings show that the regulation of DCX expression in cells migrating towards the olfactory bulb is regional. Similarly, in the dentate gyrus, EGFP-expressing cells integrated into the inner granular layer over time and gradually induced the expression of NeuN. Quantitative study revealed that more than 80% of EGFP+ cells detected in the dentate gyrus (as shown in Figure 4m) and virtually all EGFP+ cells identified in the olfactory bulb (data not shown) expressed the mature neuronal marker NeuN, indicating their neurogenesis.",0
1,25,"The investigation of EGFP-labeled neurons' neuronal phenotypes was further conducted by immunohistology at D29 to detect the presence of neurotransmitter-specific markers and calcium-binding proteins (Figure 5). Previous studies' results were affirmed as GAD65 expression, a marker commonly found in GABAergic neurons, was found in EGFP-expressing cells situated in the OB. Additionally, a specific sub-population of periglomerular EGFP+ cells was observed to exhibit co-expression of TH, a marker that is unique to dopaminergic neurons (Figure 5).",0
1,26,"VGLUT2, a marker for glutamatergic terminations, was found in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus and surrounding EGFP+ cells at D29, indicating that the EGFP-expressing cells received glutamatergic inputs (Figure 5). The expression of calcium-binding proteins such as calbindin-D28K, calretinin and parvalbumin was also examined in the EGFP-labeled granule neurons at this time point. Calbindin-D28K was detected in most EGFP+ cells of the dentate gyrus, but no parvalbumin and only weak expression of calretinin were observed in EGFP+ cells at this time point. However, cells with high levels of parvalbumin or calretinin, particularly newly generated granule cells, were present in the vicinity (as shown by the arrow in Figure 5e).",0
1,27,"DCX expression occurs in a varied group of neuronal precursors and young neurons with different levels of maturation and proliferation. BrdU was used to label proliferative cells at different times after recombination. At the earliest time point (D2), 51.1% of EGFP+ cells in the SVZ and only 7.7% of EGFP+ cells in the SGZ incorporated BrdU, indicating that some cells were still proliferating. The higher number of actively dividing cells in the SVZ may be due to young post-mitotic neurons leaving the SVZ and the most immature cells remaining. Additionally, EGFP+ cells in the SVZ/RMS/OB axis could maintain proliferative capacity until at least D15, as evidenced by a few co-labeling BrdU+/EGFP+ cells found in the RMS. No further BrdU incorporation in EGFP+ cells was seen in SGZ at D15, demonstrating the restricted proliferative capacity of DCX+ cells.",0
1,28,"After TAM was given to adult DCXCreERT2:CAG-CAT-EGFP mice, EGFP+ cells were found beyond the neurogenic areas. Previous studies have reported scattered DCX-expressing cells in the cerebral cortex of adult rodents, cats, and primates. To confirm that the EGFP expression in cells located outside of the neurogenic regions correlated with DCX expression, the whole adult brain was examined by immunohistochemistry for DCX expression in relation to EGFP activation.",0
1,29,"Cells dispersed throughout the cerebral cortex exhibited low to moderate levels of DCX expression (see Figure 7), while weak DCX expression was noticeable in the corpus callosum, around the 3rd ventricle and hypothalamus, and the MCL and GCL of cerebellum (data not shown). Four weeks following TAM injection, EGFP+ cells were detected in these same regions (Figure 7), but the reporter expression levels were considerably greater than endogenous DCX expression levels due to the use of a strong promoter for recombination. Importantly, EGFP+ cells found outside of neurogenic regions were non-proliferative, as indicated by the absence of BrdU labeling. Therefore, further investigation is required to determine the identity and fate of these immature neurons.",0
1,30,"We have successfully demonstrated that the use of a DCX promoter-driven CreERT2 allows for efficient and specific recombination targeting in vivo within DCX-expressing cells, particularly in neuronal precursors and young neurons. This approach goes beyond previously generated DCX promoter-driven reporter lines, as our construct includes the 3’UTR region of the DCX mRNA which is known to have post-transcriptional regulation elements. While this did not result in any significant differences in CreERT2 expression pattern in our study, further investigation is needed to determine its potential impact on more faithful expression within the DCX-expressing cell population.",0
1,31,"After receiving TAM, the CreERT2 protein moved to the nuclear area of cells expressing DCX, allowing recombination to occur. This led to rapid activation of reporter expression, as b-gal or EGFP could be observed in both embryonic and adult CNS just one day after injection. With five daily TAM administrations, 94% of DCX+ cells in SVZ and 77% of DCX+ cells in the dentate gyrus showed EGFP expression, proving the high efficiency of recombination under our experimental conditions. Additionally, 96% of EGFP+ cells in SVZ and 90% in SGZ co-expressed DCX, indicating that recombination activity was highly specific. The study concluded that EGFP+ cells had a solely neuronal fate and that the absence of DCX expression in a small percentage of these cells was due to the downregulation of DCX expression during the 5-day TAM injection period. (Figure 2 and 3).",0
1,32,"The CreERT2 nuclear translocation was temporary, but the reporter expression became permanently induced after recombination, which enables long-term analysis of cell types derived from DCX+ cells. A month after the recombination in DCX-CreERT2, most of the EGFP+ cells in the neurogenic target regions expressed NeuN, indicating the presence of mature neurons. Some EGFP+ cells expressed low levels of DCX localized outside neurogenic regions and along neuroblasts' migratory route. Notably, there was no co-localization observed between the EGFP signal and astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, or microglia markers a month after the last TAM injection, indicating that DCX-expressing cells become neurons under physiological conditions. In contrast, the nestin promoter-driven CreERT resulted in labeling the neural stem cell population, which generates a continuous flow of new neurons and glia [17].",0
1,33,"Calbindin-D28K, calretinin, and parvalbumin are three types of low molecular weight calcium-binding proteins that are found in different subpopulations of neurons. Calbindin-D28K is a marker of mature granule cells, while calretinin is transiently expressed in newly generated neurons. In the dentate gyrus, EGFP+ granular cells expressed Calbindin-D28K, with a few expressing low levels of calretinin, and none expressing parvalbumin four weeks after recombination. There was no co-localization between EGFP and parvalbumin, suggesting that this GABAergic subpopulation is not replenished by new neurons in the adult dentate gyrus, although this is still a topic of debate.",0
1,34,"There were EGFP+ cells found in non-neurogenic areas after recombination in DCX-CreERT mice. DCX+ cells have been observed in various non-neurogenic regions of mammals, such as the temporal and prefrontal cortex layer II, piriform cortex layer III/endopiriform nucleus, corpus callosum, nucleus accumbens, ventromedial striatum, ventrolateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, molecular cell layer, granular cell layer, and white matter of the cerebellum. The distribution and occurrence of these DCX+ cells tend to increase in more advanced species; however, it is unclear whether this is due to an upregulation of DCX expression levels or simply a better immunohistochemical detectability [7,8,35-37].",0
1,35,"The amount of cells positive for EGFP was significantly greater than those positive for DCX around the 3rd ventricle and hypothalamus, which is interesting. The difference in numbers may be due to the low level of DCX expression in these cells, making them difficult to detect using current antibodies. However, when DCX-associated recombination took place, a strong constitutive promoter controlled expression of reporter genes, making it easier to identify targeted cells.",0
1,36,"The function and origin of DCX-expressing cells that exist outside the neurogenic regions still need to be clarified. Research has shown that neural stem cells can be found in almost every region of adult CNS, and through specific treatment, neurogenic events have been induced in various areas, such as the cortex, striatum, CA1 region of the hippocampus, and even the white matter. Although some DCX-expressing cells found in these regions may have been generated through a very low rate continuous neurogenesis, the lack of BrdU labeling in these cells under physiological conditions suggests that this mechanism is most likely marginal.",0
1,37,"There is strong evidence to suggest that extra-neurogenic DCX-expressing cells are generated during developmental neurogenesis but don't fully mature, leaving them as ""quiescent"" local neuronal precursors in the parenchyma. The existence of these precursors has been suggested through grafting experiments with neural stem cells indicating that some immature neurons remain in the parenchyma, potentially serving as a reservoir of precursor cells for plasticity or local repair. (43, 44)",0
1,38,"Another mouse model expressing the DCXCreERT has been recently reported by Cheng and colleagues using a BAC construct encoding the murine DCX promoter. The differences observed between the two models may be due to the use of the human DCX promoter in our model and a possible positional effect of the transgene. While our mouse model is not exclusive to DCX-expressing cells within the hippocampus, the model presented by Cheng et al. is exclusively active in those cells. Additionally, the authors claim that recombination in their DCX-CreERT mice only occurs in post-mitotic neuronal precursors, suggesting a delayed induction of the DCXCreERT transgene expression in comparison to the endogenous DCX. The DCX-CreERT mouse model from Cheng and colleagues is suitable for studying the maturation and fate of newly generated granule cells of the dentate gyrus. However, there is still a lack of model(s) addressing the fate of DCX-expressing cells located outside of the dentate gyrus, such as in the subventricular zone (SVZ), which our model can address.",0
1,39,"We present a noteworthy transgenic mouse model utilizing an inducible Cre recombinase powered by the DCX promoter, named DCX-CreERT2. This model is highly specific and efficient for recombination in neuroblasts and newly generated neurons. Therefore, it is an effective tool for tracing neurogenesis and fate-analysis of newly generated neurons. Additionally, the model is useful for exploring the molecular mechanisms of neural plasticity and neurogenesis through the induction or silencing of specific genes in these cells. Finally, the long-term analysis of newly generated neurons provides an advantage for developing innovative therapies against neurologic diseases.",0
2,1,"Despite the numerous efforts made worldwide to control malaria, it remains a significant public health concern with almost one million deaths and approximately 250 million cases occurring annually. The majority of deaths are among children under five years old, with nearly all occurring in sub-Saharan African countries. In Benin, malaria accounted for a significant proportion of medical consultations and hospital admissions, and the National Malaria Control Programme has implemented the recommended preventive and curative strategies, including the use of Artemisinin combination therapy, intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy, long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets, and indoor residual spraying with carbamate insecticide in specific districts.",0
2,2,"Several studies have shown that the usage of insecticide treated nets significantly reduces the occurrence of uncomplicated malaria by half, but the problem of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors has increased dramatically in Africa, particularly in Benin. In experimental huts in South Benin, Anopheles gambiae was resistant to pyrethroids, which resulted in reduced efficacy of pyrethroids when used as either treated nets or IRS. To address insecticide resistance, the CREC collaborated with the IRD and the NMCP to successfully develop a new IRM strategy that combines a LLIN and a carbamate treated plastic sheeting in the same household. This strategy was evaluated in a health district in southern Benin as part of a future community-based evaluation (phase III trial), where a nation-wide distribution of LLINs to children <5 had already been implemented in 2007.",0
2,3,"A epidemiological investigation was conducted in the Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito health district, located in southern Benin (Figure 1), between December 2007 and November 2008. The study region had a populace of 178,314 inhabitants according to the results of the 3rd General Census of the Population and the Environment (RGPH3) of February 2002, and the majority of the inhabitants lived in rural areas, where agriculture was the primary livelihood. The Aïzo ethnic group constituted most of the population. The weather was chiefly subequatorial, with two dry seasons - a long dry season from December to March and a short dry season in August and September - and two rainy seasons - a long rainy season from April to July and a short rainy season from October to November. With an average annual rainfall of around 1,200 mm, roughly 700-800 mm and 400-500 mm fell during the first and second rainy seasons, respectively. The warmest months were from February to April, with temperatures reaching 31°C, while the coldest months were between July to September, with temperatures partially dropping down to 27°C. Fewer than 30% of children in the study area went to the health centre when they were ill; instead, they usually received traditional treatment. In Benin, it was found in a recent survey that less than half of febrile children below the age of five were given anti-malarial drugs, of which just 7% were given ACT.",0
2,4,"Twenty-eight villages were selected based on certain criteria, including a population of 250-500 and the absence of a local health center. Among them, seven villages were chosen randomly, and the geographical, demographical, and environmental details are provided in Table 1. Around 60 children aged 0-71 months were selected from each village, excluding those born during the study period. Ethical clearance was obtained, and written consent was given by the mosquito collectors and the head of each selected family. During the monitoring period, medical care was provided free of charge to all children in the villages, whether or not they participated in the study.",0
2,5,"Active case detection for malaria was conducted over eight periods of six consecutive days at six-week intervals throughout the year. Each day, a nurse accompanied by a local helper trained for the study visited the households in the sample. The field work was supervised by a physician. The health of each child was recorded daily on a form, with the nurse examining and recording data on every case of sickness detected at home. A thick blood film was taken from every sick child and treated according to the clinical diagnosis made by the nurse. Cross-sectional surveys were carried out at each monitoring period on every asymptomatic child, with quality controls conducted every six weeks.",0
2,6,"Data was gathered two weeks prior to each clinical monitoring utilizing the Human Landing Catches (HLC) technique [21] to capture adult mosquitoes. The study area implemented 896 human-nights of capture of human landing mosquitoes, occurring every six weeks over a one-year period. This consisted of 128 nights per village, with eight locations per village and night, half of which were indoors and the other half outdoors. The mosquito collection sites hosted treated nets, and the mosquito species were identified by morphological characteristics, based on the identification keys of Gillies & De Meillon [22] and Gillies & Coetzee [23]. All mosquitoes belonging to the An. gambiae complex and Anopheles funestus group were stored individually in tubes with silicagel and kept at -20°C for P. falciparum circumsporozoite index estimation and molecular identification.",0
2,7,"During weekly surveys, nurses conducted unannounced visits in the late evening around 9.00 PM to check the ownership, use, and correct use of LLINs (Permanet® 2.0) that were distributed in October 2007. The visits determined whether the LLINs were seen, whether children were sleeping under them, and whether they were correctly hung and tucked without tears. The rates of ownership, use, and correct use were calculated based on the total number of observations.",0
2,8,"Laboratory processing was conducted at the CREC in Cotonou. Using Giemsa-stained thick smears, parasitological infection was detected and the asexual stages of each Plasmodium species were counted in the blood volume occupied by 200 leucocytes. The parasite density was then calculated based on the assumption of 8,000 leucocytes/μL of blood. The same experienced technician read the thick smears from each village under the supervision of a parasitologist. The readings of the two technicians were compared on the same set of blood samples, and there was no significant difference in their estimations of parasite detection and density. To ensure quality control, a randomly selected sample representing 10% of all thick smears underwent cross-checking.",0
2,9,Anopheles mosquitoes collected from the field were scored and their species were identified through PCR. The molecular M and S forms of An. gambiae s.s. were determined using Favia's method based on their presence and relative frequency. Infection of individual mosquitoes was determined through ELISA using monoclonal antibodies against P. falciparum CSP on their head and thorax. The L1014F kdr allele was molecularly detected using Martinez-Torrez's method.,0
2,10,"The Access 2003 database was used to double enter demographic, parasitological, clinical, and entomological data independently. The svy command in STATA 11.0 was utilized to analyze parasitological and clinical data. Only one blood sample per monitoring period was examined for analysis, except when a pathological condition was present, and the blood sample taken during the clinical episode was saved for examination. Parasitological data was examined separately for P. falciparum asexual blood forms prevalence, density in parasite positive blood thick films, and gametocytes prevalence. The statistical analysis of repeated measures was conducted using a generalized estimating equation approach that works with normal distributions and discrete data. An exchangeable correlation structure was used to take into consideration the interdependence of observations made on the same person, with a similar correlation between the observations made on an individual being assumed. Asymptomatic malaria infections prevalence was evaluated as a binomial response using a logistic regression model.",0
2,11,"The Poisson regression model was used to test the relationship between parasite density and clinical episodes, with clinical status as the dependent variable and parasite density as the independent variable. A random intercept variable was included to account for the interdependence of observations made on the same person. The probability of malaria causing a pathological period was estimated using the Attributable Fraction calculated from odds ratios associated with parasite density in the logistic model. Pathological episodes were defined using clinical symptoms or a history of fever, and the number of malaria attacks for individuals was estimated based on the sum of probabilities calculated using parasite density.",0
2,12,"The study examined three dependent variables - prevalence rate of P. falciparum infection, mean parasite density in positive children, and clinical incidence rate, with a focus on demographic factors such as age groups and sex, environmental variables such as season and villages, and sanitary variables such as LLIN's ownership, use, and good use. The researchers used the Chi 2 test to compare rates of ownership, use, and correct use of LLIN's, and calculated an optimum pyrogenic parasite density cut-off using a logistic model to estimate AFs. They also determined the sensitivity and specificity ratios, along with positive and negative Likelihood-ratio and Youden's J index.",0
2,13,"The rate at which humans were bitten by Anopheles mosquitoes was measured as HBR, which represents the number of bites per person per night. The proportion of mosquitoes that tested positive for CSP was calculated as the sporozoite index. The entomological inoculation rate (EIR) was determined by multiplying the HBR and the sporozoite index, and it reflects the number of infected bites per person annually.",0
2,14,"During a period of 18,262 persondays, 440 children across seven villages were clinically and parasitologically monitored. Of these, 402 children were missing due to either 366 children not being found or 36 refusals. Additionally, 10 children died during the study, with an average age of inclusion being 2.1 years old and a 1:1 female/male ratio. On average, each child was visited during 42 of the 48 days, and a total of 3,074 thick blood films were taken. These included 2,838 for asymptomatic children and 236 for sick children, with an average of seven per child.",0
2,15,"Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium ovale were either present alone or in a mixed form. The annual prevalence rate of P. falciparum infection was found to be 21.8% (95%CI 19.1-24.4). According to the multivariate random-effects logistic regression model, the prevalence of infection was significantly associated with the age of children, season, village, and correct use of LLINs, but not with the ownership and use of LLINs. The correct use of LLINs was predicted to offer a 26% individual protective effect against infection prevalence (OR = 0.74 (95% CI 0.62-0.87), p = 0.005). The prevalence of infection was observed to increase with age, with children aged 1 to 2 years and 3 to 5 years being three to five times more often infected than children aged less than one year (22.0% (CI95% 17.0-27.0) and 33.0% (CI95% 28.4-37.6) versus 7.8% (CI95% 5.2-10.5)). Furthermore, the prevalence of infection was higher during the dry season (24.7% (CI95% 21.6-27.8)) than the rainy season (18.6% (CI95% 15.7-21.5)). The prevalence of infection was also higher in Satré, Wanho, Kindjitopka, and Hèkandji than in Dokanmè, Aidjèdo, and Guézohoué.",0
2,16,"The average amount of P. falciparum asexual forms in the blood of asymptomatic children who tested positive was 586 per μL (95%CI 504-680). Through the multivariate random-effects linear regression model, it was discovered that elevated parasite density was linked to specific villages (Dokanmè and Satré), not the age of the children, the seasons, or the use of LLINs (Table 4). Additionally, the annual prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes was 3.0% (95%CI 2.2-5.6) and differed considerably between the dry (3.8% (95% CI 2.9-4.8)) and the wet season (2.2% (95%CI 1.4-3.0)), p = 0.008.",0
2,17,"During the research, 236 abnormal incidents were identified. Out of these, 110 were related to parasites, with 102 of them involving P. falciparum, three involving P. malariae, two involving P. ovale, and three involving mixed infections. The densities of P. malariae single infections were 480, 2,360, and 200 parasites/μL, and those of P. ovale single infections were 4,800 and 9,800 parasites/μL. The mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. ovale had combined densities of 3,760 Pf + 720 Po, 960 Pf + 400 Po, and 280 Pf + 120 Po. Healthy children had lower mean parasite densities than sick children in all age groups. Four cases of severe malaria with anaemia were diagnosed among the four parasite-positive cases with P. falciparum, which were referred to the health centre. The total count of pathological episodes attributable to P. falciparum malaria was 74. The optimal pyrogenic parasite cut-off was determined to be 2,000 P. falciparum asexual blood forms per μL, with corresponding levels of sensitivity and specificity of 94.0% and 94.5%, respectively. The mean annual clinical incidence rate was 1.5 per child per year (95%CI 1.2-1.9).",0
2,18,"A total of 13,602 mosquitoes were captured in seven villages, with 115 An. Gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) and 67 An. funestus. Of these, nine An. Gambiae s.l. and four An. funestus were CSP positive. The aggressiveness of mosquitoes and malaria vectors was determined to be 5,541 and 74 bites per human per year, respectively. The annual EIR was 5.3 infected bites per human per year. The 1014F kdr allele was present in both the molecular M and S forms, with a frequency of 0.47 and 0.61, respectively.",0
2,19,"The rate of ownership of LLINs was 91.8% (2,769/3017; 95%IC 90.8-92.8) and remained consistently high throughout the year. However, usage was found to be significantly higher during the rainy season at 73% (1,062/1,451; 95%CI 70-75) compared to the dry season at 67% (1,047/1,566; 95%CI 64-69) with a p-value of 0.0001. Use of LLINs also significantly declined to 31% (118/385; 95%CI 26-31) in the middle of the dry season. During the rainy season, there was correct use of LLINs at its highest rate of 68% (990/1,566; 95%CI 65-70) whereas it was at 42% (665/1,171; 95%CI 40-45) during the dry season, with a p-value of <0.0001 as shown in Figure 3C.",0
2,20,"A study was conducted to characterize the epidemiology of malaria in the health district of Ouidah-KpomassèTori Bossito after the distribution of LLINs to children in October 2007. Previous studies have mainly focused on malaria transmission and clinical and parasitological aspects in rural and urban areas of Benin. Other studies have looked at process indicators for malaria control and the impact of LLIN distribution in Africa. Pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors is a concern in many African countries, but there have been no reports of LLIN effectiveness being compromised at an operational level.",0
2,21,"The area of Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito was found to be a mesoendemic area with an average EIR of 5.3 infected bites annually, according to the entomological findings. This EIR corresponded with a 21.8% annual prevalence rate of asymptomatic malaria in young children. The presence of the L1014F kdr allele in 50% of An. gambiae samples confirms previous studies in southern Benin. In line with mesoendemic areas, the infection rate increased with age. The high infection rate during the dry season may be linked to a peak observed at the end of the rainy season just after LLINs distribution. LLINs may have contributed to the constant parasite density of positive children among all age groups and seasons. Gradual immunity development against malaria could lead to a decrease in parasitaemia with increasing age.",0
2,22,"The optimal parasite pyrogenic cutoff at 2,000 P. falciparum asexual blood forms per μL was determined using the calculated AF of pathological episodes to malaria. Defining the pyrogenic parasite cut-off with AF allows for the best balance between sensitivity and specificity level. In areas with stable malaria, seasonal and age factors affect the malaria-AF of pathological episodes and the malaria case definition according to pyrogenic parasite density cutoff. In this study, however, parasite density remained consistent regardless of season or age, making the AF the same regardless of these factors. This cutoff value of 2,000 closely corresponds to the values of 1,000 found in mesoendemic areas on children under 3 years and to the values of 3,000 to 6,000 found in hyperendemic areas among children aged 0 to 12 years in the south of Benin.",0
2,23,"In the Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito health district, one third of all disease cases were attributed to malaria. To prevent missing cases, the definition for malaria cases included symptoms that suggest malaria or a history of fever within 48 hours of the start of ACD, as recommended by McGuinness (33). The average annual incidence rate of falciparum clinical malaria was 1.5 per child per year. In areas with high levels of P. falciparum, the pyrogenic threshold for parasitaemia in individuals of a certain age is the same for all species of Plasmodium (56). Given the high parasite density, P. malariae could have been responsible for one case of clinical malaria with 2,360 parasites/μL, while P. ovale could have been responsible for two cases with parasitaemia of 4,800 and 9,800 parasites/μL, respectively.",0
2,24,"Before LLINs were nationally distributed in 2001, only 4.3% of households in the south of Benin possessed a treated net (ITN) and merely 2.4% of children under five slept under them. However, by 2006, possession of ITNs had increased to 25.6% and their utilization by children under five had risen to 21% in Ouidah. Since the national distribution of LLINs, ownership has surged to over 90%, which has remained consistent over the years. Unannounced and nocturnal inspections revealed that two out of three children slept under LLINs throughout the study's 12 months. The success of sensitization relied on community beliefs and behaviors, as well as medical staff and local village helpers that partnered with the study team. The 31% reduction in LLIN use during the dry season in Benin is similar to other West African countries.",0
2,25,"The health district of Ouidah-KpomassèTori Bossito is an area with moderate pyrethroid resistance of vectors and high heterogeneity of malaria infection between villages. Malaria infection and disease remained consistent throughout the year, but the use of LLINs was found to reduce malaria infection without affecting its morbidity.",0
3,1,"In recent decades, Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and the associated postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) have caused significant losses in global agriculture. Detecting PCV2 rapidly is crucial for effective PMWS prophylaxis and treatment. To create a sensitive and specific assay for PCV2 detection and quantification, we synthesized specific primers and a probe in the open reading frame 2. Our assay was highly reproducible, linear, and had a broad dynamic range, detecting between 102 and 1010 copies of genomic DNA per reaction. The assay did not cross-react with porcine circovirus type 1, porcine reproductive and respiratory, porcine epidemic diarrhea, transmissible gastroenteritis of pigs, and rotavirus. The limits of detection and quantitation were 10 and 100 copies, respectively, and 39 out of 40 tested samples were accurately detected using this established real-time PCR system.",0
3,2,"PCV2 is prevalent among commercial swine [1-5] and is known to cause several diseases, including PMWS [6]. In China, PCV2 infection is widespread [7] and poses a significant challenge to the pig farming industry. Consequently, it is crucial to develop reliable and efficient techniques for detecting the virus.'",0
3,3,"Real-time PCR is a more efficient method for detecting target fragments with greater specificity and quantitative capabilities compared to conventional PCR and ELISA. This technique also effectively prevents false positives and contamination, making it the preferred pathogen detection method.",0
3,4,The synthesis of specific primers and a TaqMan probe for PCV2 was implemented for the purpose of this investigation. A precise and sensitive assay was successfully developed to detect and quantify PCV2.,0
3,5,"Based on the nucleotide sequences of open reading frame 2 (ORF2) obtained from GenBank (EU921257.1), the primer and TaqMan probe design utilized the PCV2 strain from China (BJ0804) as a reference. Primer Premier 5.0, Oligo Primer Analysis software, and DNAman 4.0 were used to create the primers and probe (refer to Table 1). The amplified product was 149 bp long.",0
3,6,"A PCR fragment was inserted into a pGEM-T Easy vector to create a standard plasmid following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The plasmid was propagated in Escherichia coli JM109 cells and then purified and quantified using an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE, USA). The plasmid sample was diluted ten-fold to obtain 1010-100 per μL, which contained 100 ng/μL yeast tRNA, for real-time PCR. The dilutions were stored at -20°C, and the plasmids were stored at -70°C.",0
3,7,"The PCR amplifications were conducted using a 25-μL reaction volume that contained 1×PCR buffer, 200 μM of dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP, 1.25 U of DNA polymerase, 2 mM of MgCl2 from TaKaRa in Dalian, China, 200 nM of each primer, and variable quantities of plasmid DNA templates. The programmed amplification process involved a step of 94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 20 s, and concluded with a final step of 72°C for 7 min. The 149 bp amplicons were segregated via a 2% agarose gel that contained 5% Goldview from SBS Genetech in Shanghai, China. Every reaction adopted both negative and positive reference samples.",0
3,8,"Real-time PCR was conducted on an ABI 7500 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) using a 25 μL volume. The reaction mixture consisted of 1× PCR buffer, 400 nM primers, 200 nM TaqMan probes, 400 μM each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP, 1.25 U Taq DNA polymerase, and 4.5 mM MgCl2. Real-time PCR run was initiated at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 40 s. For the generation of a standard curve, serial dilutions ranging from 10 10 to 100 copies of the plasmid were used. The assay was conducted in duplicate, and two negative controls were included in each run.",0
3,9,"The assay's limit of quantitation (LOQ) was established by running triplicates of samples containing 107, 105, 103, and 102 copies per sample. Furthermore, the assay's limit of detection (LOD) was estimated by running samples containing 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10 and 1 copy per sample.",0
3,10,"The real-time PCR's coefficients of variation (CVs) were assessed using a standard PCV2 plasmid containing 10^7, 10^5, and 10^3 copies. Both intra- and inter-assay CVs for Ct values were measured. The assay's specificity was tested by running plasmid samples containing 10^8 to 10^4 copies, along with cDNA and DNA of various porcine viruses, under optimal conditions. Negative controls were also included in the run.",0
3,11,"The samples included 3 PCV2-positive samples along with 37 unknown serum and tissue samples, which were tested using both conventional PCR and real-time PCR with ideal conditions. The results of conventional PCR were observed with the use of a 2% agarose gel.",0
3,12,'A standard curve was constructed using ten-fold serial plasmid dilutions. The Ct values were measured and plotted against the logarithm of the plasmid copy number (Figure 1). The standard curve had a broad dynamic range from 102-1010 copies/μL and showed a strong linear correlation (R2=0.9999) between the Ct value and the logarithm of the plasmid copy number.',0
3,13,"To ensure accurate measurement of results in optimal circumstances, around 100 template copies were deemed necessary to determine the LOQ of this assay. When the amount of template copies decreased below 100, the Ct values fell beyond the linear range (Figure 2). While the target sequence was detectable in all amplification reactions down to 10 copies, it was undetectable when just one copy was present (Figure 3). Therefore, these findings suggest that the LOD value was approximately 10 copies.",0
3,14,"The coefficient of variation (CV) for the Ct values varied from 0.59% to 1.05% within the same assay and from 1.9% to 4.2% across 10 different assays as shown in Table 2. None of the negative control and samples for PCV1, PRRS, PED, TGE, and RV showed any increase in fluorescence.",0
3,15,Table 3 and 4 demonstrate that the positive rates for PCV2 in unrecognized samples were 78.3% for conventional PCR detection and 97.3% for real-time PCR detection. The usage of real-time PCR increased the detection of PCV2 samples by 18% compared to conventional PCR.,0
3,16,"The majority of viral loads ranged from 10 to 1000 copies/μL in the samples, although some had as many as 108 copies/μL. The DNA extracted from serum samples contained 360 and 1560 copies of PCV2 per microliter in the PPV and PRV, indicating that the pigs from whom the samples were taken had co-infections of PCV2.",0
3,17,"Based on serological surveys, it has been revealed that farms and individual pigs in various parts of Europe, the United States, and Canada exhibit PCV2 seropositivity up to 100%. Likewise, in seven provinces and municipalities in China, it was identified through ELISA that the seropositive rate is as high as 42.9%.",0
3,18,"PCV2 is known to increase pig mortality from 2-3% to 14-30%. Thus, there is an urgent need for rapid and sensitive detection and quantitation assays for PCV2 in both the pig industry and research community. TaqMan real-time PCR is a more sensitive and less easily contaminated option compared to conventional PCR. Conventional PCR has the risk of contamination which leads to false-positive results, especially when examining products in gels. Real-time PCR is favored as it requires less time and has heightened sensitivity.",0
3,19,"The most suitable reference fragment to detect PCV2 is the major conserved region located in ORF2. This is because it displays a significant diversity between PCV1 and PCV2, and there are more sequenced isolates available from PCV2 than from PCV1. Previous studies have primarily utilized hybridization probes that exclusively bind to target products to detect PCV2, with high sensitivity and specificity. However, other methods exist to detect and quantify PCV2, including TaqMan probes, TaqMan real-time PCR, and SYBR Green I. These methods have been used by different researchers to quantify PCV2 in various tissues and serum samples.",0
3,20,"We devised various primers, a probe, and a real-time PCR system in this research to identify PCV2 through amplification of a 149-bp fragment. The real-time PCR technique boosted the recognition of PCV2 samples by 18% compared to conventional PCR. Our method's consistency was confirmed by tests on reproducibility, indicating stability and dependability. We executed a range of experiments to evaluate the assay's reproducibility, sensitivity, and specificity. The specificity of the assay was proved by detecting no cross-reaction signals while working with different swine viruses as templates. The real-time PCR system we designed could not only quickly and sensitively identify PCV2 but could also be applied to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines for PCV2. The real-time PCR detection system is a complementary and enhanced form of previous PCV2 detection and quantitation methods. Furthermore, it offers an alternative approach to identifying PCV2 specifically.",0
4,1,"According to research, approximately 110 million clinical cases of malaria are diagnosed each year in Nigeria, which means that around 50% of the adult population suffers from at least one malaria episode annually. Children are even more vulnerable, with two to four attacks per year. The country also experiences an extensive economic impact, with an estimated loss of around 132 billion Naira (or approximately 878 million USD) annually due to malaria. In response to the issue, the Nigerian government developed its first National Malaria Control Policy in 1996, followed by the introduction of the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) programme in 1999.",0
4,2,"In 2002, national drug efficacy trials were conducted in Nigeria and found that chloroquine and sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) were no longer effective as first-line treatments for malaria. In response, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) was introduced in 2005, with artemetherlumefantrine becoming the recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria and artesunate-amodiaquine (AS + AQ) as an alternative. SP is now only used for intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) in pregnant women due to its high resistance level of up to 35%. Furthermore, SP and SMP have a similar structure, which may result in cross-resistance.",0
4,3,"Despite the introduction of ACT for uncomplicated malaria treatment several years ago, it is still underutilized in the field due to poor availability and/or high cost on the African market. The RBM strategy emphasizes quick access to appropriate treatment within 24 hours of symptom onset. An ideal anti-malarial drug for home use should be safe, effective, affordable, easy to administer, and available in a single dose package. Fixed-dose combinations (FDC) are preferred over co-blistered drugs as it prevents inadequate dosing and increases compliance, ultimately preventing drug resistance.",0
4,4,"In terms of the ideal characteristics for an antimalarial drug, the AS + SMP (artesunate and sulphamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine) combination could be a viable alternative treatment option if first-line drugs are not readily available. This particular drug has proven to be both simple to use and safe, with high efficacy rates observed in various endemic areas regardless of whether it is administered over 24 or 48 hours [3-5]. Previously offered as a co-blistered drug [6,7], it is now available as a fixed-dose combination (FDC), which requires only three tablets for administration, making it more convenient for malaria patients. Additionally, the SMP component offers a number of ancillary benefits due to its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, which could be helpful in treating other infections that may have been misdiagnosed as malaria [8,9].",0

Malaria transmission in the region, caused mainly by Plasmodium falciparum, is endemic and peaks in August, lasting for six months (May-October). Anopheles gambiae s.l. is responsible for overall entomological inoculation rates ranging from 18 to 145 infective bites per person per year.

Based on the assumption that both treatments would achieve a 94% cure rate and taking into account a 10-15% loss to follow-up, a sample size of 250 patients was required for each treatment arm. This sample size would allow for the detection of a 6% difference in parasitological cure rates with 80% power and a one-sided alpha of 0.025.

Parasite density was determined by counting the parasites against leukocytes found in 200 power fields, with an assumption that there were 6,000 leukocytes in each microliter of blood. Plasmodium parasite species were identified from thin blood smears. Discordant slides and those with a parasite density difference greater than or equal to 50% were examined by a third microscopist. To ensure quality control, 10% of the slides were randomly selected for independent examination by another microscopist who was not involved in the study.",0

Two clerks performed dual data entry, which was later compared, corrected, and validated by the data manager. For data analysis, Epi Info version 6 and SPSS version 11 were used, where the primary analysis was a non-inferiority analysis based on PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) on day 28 as the primary efficacy endpoint. Secondary endpoints included parameters such as gametocyte carriage, fever and parasite clearance time, and packed cell volume levels. For statistical analysis, Chisquare and Fisher exact or Yate's correction tests were used for comparisons between the treatment groups. Skewed data was analysed using non-parametric tests, while normally distributed continuous variables were compared using Student's t test between two independent groups. Kaplan Meier was used to analyse the significance between the rates of reinfection in the two treatment arms. A two-tailed p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Finally, the Intention-To-Treat (ITT) population was included in the safety analysis, which consisted of all patients randomized to either treatment group and received at least one dose of study medication.",0
4,18,"Out of the total 3,500 children who were screened for malaria, only 500 were selected for the trial. These 500 were divided equally, with 250 being assigned to the AS + AQ treatment group and 250 to the AS + SMP group, as shown in Figure 1. Though 6.6% (33) of the children were lost in the follow-up process, with 21 lost from AS + SMP and 12 lost from AS + AQ, both treatment groups had similar baseline demographic, clinical, parasitological and laboratory characteristics, as Table 1 suggests.",0
4,19,"""In each treatment arm, there was one early treatment failure, resulting in a 0.4% failure rate. The PCR corrected cure rates for day 28 were 97.9% for the AS + AQ arm and 95.6% for the AS + SMP arm (p = 0.15). The re-infection rate was 1.7% for the AS + AQ arm and 5.7% for the AS + SMP arm (Table 2, 3 and Additional file 1) (p = 0.021).""",0
4,20,"The two treatment groups had similar median fever clearance time, with both AS + SMP and AS + AQ taking around 1 day (p=0.271). The median parasite clearance time was also similar, with AS + SMP taking 1-7 days and AS + AQ taking 1-3 days (p=0.941). The proportion of children with gametocytes was similar in both groups throughout the follow-up period. On day 0, 16 children in each treatment arm had gametocytes (7.0% for AS + SMP and 6.7% for AS + AQ), and on day 28, the proportion of children with gametocytes was reduced (2.2% for AS + SMP and 3.4% for AS + AQ, p=0.408). On day 14, the proportion of children with anaemia was reduced to 1.3% in both treatment groups (Figure 3).",0
4,21,"Adverse events were not serious and were reported in a similar proportion in both treatment groups. Some patients reported mild adverse events such as vomiting, excessive sleepiness, abdominal pain, and weakness. No patients needed to be hospitalized due to these events, and laboratory values remained normal throughout the follow-up period.",0
4,22,The effectiveness and tolerance of AS + SMP are being recorded in comparison to the recommended AS + AQ ACT to treat uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in children living in a malaria-endemic area of south-western Nigeria. The study monitored the participants' progress for 28 days.,0
4,23,"Several African nations have embraced artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) as the primary treatment for uncomplicated malaria. These treatments include artemetherlumefantrine (AL) and AS + AQ. However, field observations indicate the need to explore other options for ACTs to ensure suitable alternatives are available for patients requiring treatment. The study found that AS + SMP resulted in a 28-day cure rate of 95.6%, while AS + AQ had a cure rate of 97.9% (p = 0.151), suggesting both drugs had comparable therapeutic effectiveness.",0
4,24,"These results align with previous studies conducted on AS + SMP in both endemic and non-endemic malaria regions [3-7]. The observed cure rate for AS + AQ also matches rates reported in other studies [16-18]. The higher proportion of children under the age of 5 in the AS + AQ group may have contributed to a lower ability to clear malaria parasites due to their relatively weaker immune systems. Although the loss-to-follow-up rate was higher in the AS + SMP group (21 vs. 12), it was not necessarily linked to drug efficacy as it primarily resulted from changes in school attendance and other social factors. The need to screen 3,500 children to achieve the desired sample size of 250 individuals per treatment arm suggests that a considerable number of fever cases in children may be caused by bacterial instead of malaria infections [9]. Despite the lack of parasitological confirmation, the SMP component of AS + SMP may have offered clinical benefits to children with bacterial infections who were wrongly diagnosed with malaria.",0
4,25,"The gametocyte carriage rates were similar before and after treatment in both treatment groups, likely due to the effects of artesunate. While sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine has been shown to increase gametocyte carriage after treatment, this was not the case with SMP. In fact, Sowunmi et al found that AQ + SMP treatment did not lead to increased gametocyte carriage, despite slower clearance of sexual parasitaemia compared to AL treatment in children.",0
4,26,"Both treatment regimens, AS + SMP and AS + AQ, were well tolerated and there was no significant difference in the reported frequency of adverse events. It was challenging to distinguish adverse events from malaria-related symptoms. Notably, the occurrence of itching in patients treated with AS + AQ was low, consistent with a previous study. There were no reports of severe adverse events such as icterus or intravascular haemolysis. However, the follow-up revealed a lower packed cell volume in patients treated with AS + SMP, which may be due to a high prevalence of G6PD deficiency in the study area. Screening for G6PD deficiency in all patients would have substantiated this finding.'",0
4,27,"This study shows that giving AS + SMP FDC in three doses over 24 hours or AS + AQ FDC in three doses over 48 hours have similar effectiveness in reducing fever and clearing parasites in children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Nigeria. Both drugs are safe, but AS + SMP has a higher re-infection rate. AS + SMP could be a good alternative to first line treatments in areas where they are not available or too expensive. However, continued monitoring of drug resistance is needed due to potential cross resistance between SP and SMP.",0
5,1,"Chronic depression is a global public health problem. Despite the availability of several depression drugs, they often come with significant side effects and may not provide satisfactory results for many patients. The lack of complete understanding of depression's causes also impedes the development of more effective treatments. Research suggests a possible link between immunological changes and major depression. Studies have shown that systemic administration of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines or bacterial products to animals can trigger sickness behavior, ultimately leading to depressive behavior. This condition is characterized by decreased food consumption, social isolation, changes in the circadian cycle, and reduced locomotor activity.",0
5,2,"Toll-like receptors (TLR) are responsible for recognizing microbial structures, with Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) commonly binding to TLR4 and activating intracellular pathways. Studies have shown that LPS-induced depression in rodents is linked to cytokine production, which is also elevated in depressed patients. Additionally, TLR activation following infection can lead to systemic inflammation and brain-controlled illness in rats.",0
5,3,"Kinins, a collection of peptides, are swiftly generated in response to various stimuli [9], activating two G protein-coupled receptors known as B1 and B2 once unleashed. B2 receptors are ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, while B1 receptors are typically not expressed under normal conditions, but are promptly upregulated after infection, trauma, or exposure to certain cytokines [10-13]. Previous publications have established the vital role of TNFa in the upregulation of kinin B1 receptors [14-17]. As a result, B1 receptors are likely to be induced under specific pathological circumstances and involved in various chronic inflammatory and pain processes [9,10].",0
5,4,"Previous research has shown that in animal models of peripheral inflammation, cytokine production from either E. coli or P. gingivalis can lead to a significant increase in kinin B1 receptor expression [14,15,18]. Recent studies have additionally linked kinin B1 receptors to CNS illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, neuropathic pain, and epilepsy [19-21]. To test whether B1 receptor involvement might also play a role in depression-like behavior resulting from E. coli LPS in mice who undergo swimming sessions as a stressor, we conducted this study. This Protocol is based on the notion of increased susceptibility when external and internal stressors combine to produce allostatic overload [2,22,23]. We also used flow cytometry, ELISA, and real-time PCR to explore some of the mechanisms underlying B1 receptor induction in LPS-treated depressed animals. Immunohistochemical studies were also used to determine whether antagonism of kinin B1 receptors could influence glial activity.",0
5,5,"The drugs and reagents listed below were utilized in the study. Imipramine, LPS from E. coli serotype 0111:B4, aprotinin A, benzethonium chloride, EDTA, HTAB, hydrogen peroxide, PMSF, TMB and Tween-20 were all obtained from Sigma Chemical Company in St. Louis, USA. R-715 was generously provided by Dr. Domenico Regoli from the University of Sherbrooke in Sherbooke, Quebec, Canada. Meanwhile, SSR240612 was kindly supplied by SanofiSynthelabo Recherche in Montpellier, France, and FR173657 was donated by Fournier Laboratories in Dijon, France. The stock solutions of the drugs were stored in siliconized plastic tubes in PBS at -18°C, and then diluted to the desired concentration just before use.",0
5,6,"The study used male CF1 and C57/BL6 wild-type mice or TNFa p55 receptor knockout mice weighing 25 to 30 g. They were kept in optimal living conditions with a 12 hour light-dark cycle, 22 ± 1°C temperature, and 60 to 80% humidity. They had ad libitum access to food and water. CF1 mice were obtained from UFPEL, while C57/BL6 wild-type or TNFa p55 receptor knockout mice were supplied by UFMG. The experiments were conducted within a specific time frame and followed ethical guidelines for the investigation of experimental pain in conscious animals by Zimmermann (1983). Additionally, the experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committees of SC and RS.",0
5,7,"As a preliminary stress inducer, the animals were made to swim forcefully for 5 minutes in water with a temperature of 23 ± 1°C. After that, injections of LPS from E. coli (serotype 0111:B4) were given to them intraperitoneally at the doses of 450 mg/kg (CF1 mice) or 1000 μg/kg (C57/BL6 wild-type, or TNFa p55 receptor knockout mice). The control groups were administered saline (0.9% NaCl solution, 10 ml/kg, i.p.). The required intake of LPS and the forced swimming method were chosen by carrying out pilot experiments (not displayed).",0
5,8,"After administering LPS, the animals' behavior was evaluated at different time points (6, 24, or 48 hours) depending on the experimental protocol. Trained experimenters who were unaware of the treatment groups evaluated all behavioral parameters. Separate groups of mice were euthanized at various time points after LPS injection to conduct biochemical, molecular biology, and immunohistochemical assays as described in later sections.",0
5,9,"To confirm whether kinin receptors are involved in the behavioral changes triggered by LPS from E. coli, the animals were given one of the following drugs prior to behavioral tests: SSR240612 (a selective antagonists of kinin B1 receptor) at 5 mg/kg (i.p., 30 min) or 10 mg/kg (p.o., 1 h), or R-715 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min) or FR173657 (a selective kinin B2 receptor antagonist) at 30 mg/kg (i.p., 30 min). As a positive control drug, imipramine (a classical tricyclic antidepressant) was used at 10 mg/kg (i.p., 30 min). The corresponding schedules of treatment were followed for the antagonists and control animals received 0.9% NaCl solution (10 ml/kg). For molecular biology and immunohistochemical studies, animals were treated with SSR240612 at 5 mg/kg (i.p.) 30 min before LPS and were sacrificed at specific times, as described in subsequent sections. The doses of kinin antagonists and imipramine were based on previous publications [25-27].",0
5,10,"After administering LPS from E. coli to animals, depression-like behavior was evaluated using the tail-suspension model as per Steru et al. (1985) methodology. The animals were suspended using adhesive tape approximately 1 cm from the tip of their tails at different time points (6, 24, or 48 hours) after LPS treatment. The duration of immobility exhibited by mice over a period of 6 minutes was recorded in seconds.",0
5,11,"Anhedonia is a condition in which there is decreased pleasure sensation. In mice, this can be measured by observing a reduction in sucrose intake. The study's testing protocol was derived from the method developed by Strakaliva et al in 2004. The mice were given a 1% sucrose solution for three consecutive days, during which they were made to swim twice a day in cold water as a pre-stressful stimuli. After the last swimming session, the mice were given LPS from E.coli (450 μg/kg, i.p) and were deprived of food and water for 24 hours, consistent with the original protocol. The sucrose intake of the mice was then recorded for 12 hours, during which they were given access to two bottles, one containing 1% sucrose solution and the other with tap water. The weight differences of the bottles were used to calculate the consumption of sucrose using the formula: % sucrose intake = [sucrose intake (g)] × 100/[sucrose intake (g) + tap water (g)]. Prior to LPS injection, the animals were subjected to treatment with SSR240612, a selective kinin B1 receptor antagonist (10 mg/kg, p.o., 1 h), or the antidepressant imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min). Control animals were given saline solution using the same treatment schedule.",0
5,12,"To examine how swimming session followed by LPS treatment affects the locomotor activity, the animals underwent an open-field test [30] either 6 or 24 hours after being given endotoxin. The testing was carried out in a soundproof room with minimal lighting. The mice were placed in a 40 x 60 x 50 cm acrylic box and observed as they crossed the floor divided into 9 squares using all four of their paws. The recording of their movements was conducted for a duration of 6 minutes.",0
5,13,The temperature of the mouse's colon was measured with a Pro-check® thermometer that was coated in Vaseline and inserted approximately 0.5 cm into a mouse that was gently held by hand. The initial colon temperature was recorded at t = 0 and the body temperature of the mice was measured 6 or 24 hours after injection with LPS.,0
5,14,"Mouse hippocampi and cortex were harvested using a specialized device after euthanasia by decapitation at 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours after LPS injection. The Trizol reagent from Invitrogen was used to extract total RNA as per the manufacturer's instructions, and the concentration was measured by absorbance at 260 nm. For reverse transcript (cDNA) generation, 2 μg of total RNA were reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) as a primer (0.05 μg), Promega's 50 U of reverse transcriptase, Promega's dNTP (144 μM), reaction buffer [10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 3 mM MgCl2, 75 mM KCl, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3], and Promega's 2 U of RNAsin Plus, in a final volume of 12.5 μl. The cDNA was then obtained by warming the samples to 70°C for 5 min, cooling them to 4°C for 5 min, and then incubating them at 37°C for 60 min followed by 70°C for 5 min and a final round of cooling to 4°C for 5 min.",0
5,15,"Fluorescence-based real-time PCR was used to detect B1 receptor and BDNF mRNA expression. TaqMan-based chemistry with specific primers and FAM-labeled probes for mouse BDNF, B1 receptor, and GAPDH were used for amplification. The endogenous control for normalization was GAPDH. Amplifications were performed in a Thermalcycler for 50 cycles. The fluorescence was collected at each cycle, and the data were analyzed using the 2-ΔΔCt method for relative quantification. The target gene expression was normalized against conditions found in naive animals. Approximately 100 ng of cDNA was amplified in duplicates.",0
5,16,"Brain samples were fixed in a phosphate buffered saline solution with 4% paraformaldehyde after 24 hours of LPS treatment. These samples were then embedded in paraffin after undergoing standard histological procedures. CD68 antibody was used for immunohistochemistry to determine glial activity in the hippocampus sections that were cut at approximately 3 mm from bregma [2,31]. The slides were quenched with hydrogen peroxide and underwent high temperature antigen retrieval before being washed with PBS and incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody. The Streptavidin-HRP reagent was processed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and sections were developed with DAB and counterstained with Harris's hematoxylin. Control and experimental tissues were prepared and processed under the same conditions.",0
5,17,"The Sight DS-5M-L1 digital camera was connected to a Nikon Eclipse-80i light microscope to acquire images. Image acquisition settings were the same for both control and experimental tissues. Four fields in the hippocampal sub-regions CA1, CA2, CA3, and DG were counted for CD-68 positive cells in mice using a 40X magnification.",0
5,18,"The animals were subjected to forced swimming and administered LPS from E. coli, as previously described. They were then euthanized at various time intervals after LPS administration (1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours) by decapitation. TNFa levels were measured in serum or whole brain using a standard sandwich ELISA technique following the supplier's recommendations (R&D Systems, USA). In the case of brain assays, the tissues were removed and placed in a PBS solution containing 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM benzamethonium chloride, 10 mM EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin A, and 0.5% BSA. The mouse brains were homogenized, followed by centrifugation at 3,000× g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for ELISA analysis.",0
5,19,"CSF samples were collected from the cisterna magna of mice using a modified version of the method outlined by Liu and Duff. The mice were subjected to forced swimming and treated with LPS from E. coli, and were subsequently anesthetized and placed on a stereotaxic instrument. A sagittal incision was made below the occiput to aspirate the CSF using an insulin needle and a Hamilton syringe. The collected CSF was stored in an Eppendorf tube and frozen until use. Control samples were taken from naïve animals. Collection time points were at one, three, and twenty-four hours after treatment.",0
5,20,"The quantitative measurement of cytokines in the CSF was performed using the BD Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) and the CBA Mouse Inflammation Kit® from BD Bioscience in San Jose, CA. The assay simultaneously detected interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interferon-g (IFN-g), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), and interleukin-12p70 (IL-12p70). The medium range of 633 nm was used for flow cytometer readings with FACSCanto II red laser. The data were acquired using FACSDiva software and analyzed using FCAP Array software, both provided by BD Bioscience. The captured cytokines were detected using six different antibodies coupled to phycoerythrin (PE) via direct immunoassay. Standard curves were generated for each cytokine using the mixed cytokine beads standard provided by the kit with a concentration range of 20 to 5000 pg/ml. Five standard curves were plotted, and the concentrations of each CSF cytokine were determined using the MFI value of each cytokine with a four-parameter logistic curve fitting model. In cases where a sample had a cytokine concentration below the detection limit for the assay, a value of 0 was assigned for that concentration.",0
5,21,"Results for behavioral parameters and Elisa protocols were presented as the mean ± SEM of 6 to 8 animals, while results for real-time PCR, flow cytometry and immunohistochemical experiments were provided as the mean ± SEM of 4 independent experiments performed in triplicate. A one-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc test was conducted for statistical comparison between these values, and p values less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) were considered significant.",0
5,22,"The behavior of mice subjected to E. coli LPS administration after a swimming session is depicted in Figure 1a. According to the tail-suspension paradigm, depression-like behavior was exhibited by these animals over time. At 24 hours, there was a significant increase in immobility time (P < 0.01), which returned to control levels at 48 hours (P < 0.05). Imipramine, a popular antidepressant, decreased immobility time by 47 ± 16% (Figure 1a) in mice who had received it. B1 receptor antagonists R-715 (0.5 mg/kg, 30 min), SSR240612 (5 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min), and oral administration of SSR240612 (10 mg/kg, 1 h) all resulted in significant inhibition of LPS-induced depression-like behavior (Figure 1c), with inhibition percentages of 46 ± 6%, 33 ± 7%, and 30 ± 6%, respectively. However, FR173657 (30 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min), a selective kinin B2 receptor antagonist, did not significantly change immobility time in this model (P > 0.05; Figure 1b).",0
5,23,"The effects of LPS treatment on rodents have been extensively studied, and our research confirms previous findings. Administering E. coli LPS to mice (which had been forced to swim beforehand) led to a significant decrease in body temperature (as shown in Figure 1e), as well as a decrease in locomotor activity in an open-field arena. The reduction in locomotive activity was most pronounced six hours after LPS administration, but levels returned to normal after 24 hours (as seen in Figure 1f). Body temperature was also significantly reduced at the six-hour mark, but not at 24 hours. Interestingly, administering R-715 (at a dose of 0.5mg/kg) 30 minutes before the test did not significantly affect body temperature after 6 hours. We only used SSR240612 (which has good oral bioavailability) for subsequent experiments.",0
5,24,"The relationship between the effects of selective kinin B1 receptor antagonists and changes in B1 receptor expression in CNS structures was investigated by measuring B1 receptor mRNA expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice. After the mice were submitted to a session of forced swimming, they were given LPS administration. The results from quantitative real-time experiments showed a time-dependent, significant increase in B1 receptor mRNA levels in the hippocampus, which reached a peak at 1 h (about 2.5-fold increase) (Figure 2a). Similarly, in the cortex, this increase was almost 40-fold 1 h after LPS treatment (Figure 2b).",0
5,25,"Figure 3 shows that when mice were subjected to forced swimming prior to LPS treatment, there was a significant increase in CD68 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus, indicating higher glial cell activation. Interestingly, pre-treatment with the kinin B1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 (5 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 minutes before LPS administration almost completely inhibited CD68 labeling, whereas the antidepressant imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) had no impact. These results suggest that imipramine and kinin B1 receptor antagonist have different mechanisms for achieving their antidepressant-like effects. Reduced expression of neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF, has been associated with depression. In our study, real-time PCR experiments revealed a significant reduction in BDNF expression in the hippocampus of mice subjected to our depression protocol, at both the 6- and the 24-hour time points (approximately 50% decrease). However, pre-treatment with the kinin B1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 (5 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 minutes before LPS administration had no significant effect on this parameter (Figure 4).",0
5,26,"The changes elicited by LPS were correlated with cytokine production by assessing levels of TNFa in the whole brain or mouse serum. The animals underwent a forced swimming session and were treated with E.coli LPS, resulting in a marked, time-dependent increase in TNFa production in brain or serum. TNFa levels peaked between 1 and 3 hours in serum and between 3 and 6 hours in the brain, returning to control values after 6 and 12 hours, respectively. CSF cytokines IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-g were below detection levels, while IL-12 concentration was similar to that observed in naïve animals. CSF TNFa levels peaked 1 hour after LPS injection and remained elevated until 3 hours later.",0
5,27,"We investigated the role played by TNFa in the depression-like behavior observed in our experimental paradigm due to its interrelation with B1 receptor upregulation. We used TNFa p55 receptor-deficient mice and found that the depression-like behavior caused by forced swimming plus LPS treatment was abolished in mice with genetic deletion of TNFa p55 receptors. We also observed that the increase of B1 receptor mRNA expression in mice submitted to forced swimming plus LPS treatment was completely absent in TNFa p55 receptor knockout animals. We used C57/BL6 mice and found that a dose of 1000 μg/kg of E. coli LPS was necessary to evoke a significant increase in immobility time in the tail-suspension test, comparable to that obtained with a 450 μg/kg dose in CF1 mice.",0
5,28,"In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the genetic, biochemical, and immunological factors involved in depression. Specifically, research has identified certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1b, and TNFa, as key molecules in depression-related behaviors following infection. These cytokines are believed to coordinate the body's inflammatory response to pathogens. In a study involving mice, administration of LPS after a swimming session led to reduced body temperature and locomotor activity, followed by an increase in immobility time in the tail suspension test - a depression-like behavior. Although sickness behavior is considered an initial normal response to infectious stimuli, depression-like states can persist even after the initial sickness has resolved.",0
5,29,"There has been no prior research linking kinin B 1 receptors with depression to our knowledge. Normally these receptors are not present in the peripheral nervous system but can quickly increase in response to stressful stimuli. However, they are present in the spinal cord and some brain structures including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and choroid plexus epithelial cells. The role of kinins in the brain is not yet completely clear, but the presence of B1 receptors in the nervous system indicates a potential central role for them. This study aims to investigate the potential involvement of these receptors in the development of depression-like behavior due to pre-stressful and LPS stimuli.",0
5,30,"The antidepressant imipramine reduced the depression-like state observed in the tail suspension test, while B1 receptor antagonists were effective in inhibiting increased immobility. These findings suggest that B1 receptors play a role in depression-like behavior. In vivo experiments showed an increase in B1 receptor mRNA expression in the hippocampus and cortex of mice subjected to forced swimming plus LPS administration. This is the first demonstration that infection associated with a stressful stimulus might up-regulate B1 receptors in the CNS, leading to depressive behavior. The selective B2 receptor antagonist had no significant effect on immobility time in this paradigm.",0
5,31,"Functional data obtained from the tail suspension test was supplemented by results using the anhedonia paradigm of sucrose intake. SSR240612 was able to completely revert reduced sucrose consumption in LPS-treated mice, which is noteworthy because depression is often associated with anhedonic states. It was found that stressful forced swimming plus LPS administration decreased sucrose consumption in Swiss mice, a parameter that was reversed by the antidepressant imipramine, which adds to the reliability of the experiment. The B1 receptor antagonist R-715 did not significantly change sickness behavior-induced hypothermia. This suggests that blocking B1 receptors can reverse later depression-like symptoms without interfering with early sickness behavior coordinated mainly by cytokines.",0
5,32,"The CNS's major immunocompetent components include microglia and astrocytes, and their activation contributes to depression pathogenesis [43,47,48]. In mice, our data clearly show microglial activation following forced swimming and LPS treatment, evidenced by increased CD-68 immunostaining in the hippocampus 24 hours after LPS injection, when B1 mRNA levels return to baseline. Microglial activation due to various injuries results in the release of neurotoxic mediators, like pro-inflammatory cytokines [3,49]. The selective non-peptide B1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 virtually abolished CD-68 immunopositivity, although this parameter wasn't significantly altered by imipramine. Therefore, we suggest that B1 receptor antagonists' antidepressant-like effects are related to microglial activation inhibition, not imipramine's effects. These findings are significant and could lead to a better understanding of depression states, mainly those linked to infections.",0
5,33,"Depression is linked to changes in synaptic plasticity that lead to reduced BDNF function and other biochemical alterations. Stressful conditions can repress the BDNF gene, resulting in neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus. Interestingly, BDNF infusion in certain brain regions can induce antidepressant-like effects in animal models. Many monoaminergic antidepressant drugs restore normal BDNF transcriptional levels. In our depression model, there was a sustained decrease in BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus for up to 24 hours. The selective B1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 did not significantly alter BDNF mRNA expression, despite preventing microglial activation. This suggests that SSR240612 has antidepressant-like activity through a different inflammatory pathway, rather than interfering with BDNF.",0
5,34,"Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a significant role in the development of depression. TNFa levels are elevated in patients with major depressive disorder, and treatment with TNFa antagonists improves symptoms and quality of life. The study confirmed the hypothesis by showing that LPS administration in pre-stressed mice results in an increase in TNFa levels in serum, CSF, and whole brain. The elevated TNFa levels in serum contribute to sickness behavioral changes, whereas the increased levels in the brain underlie depression-like behavior. The study also found an increase in TNFa levels in CSF.",0
5,35,"The communication pathway between the brain and immune system is supported by the presence of TNFa in the CSF. Macrophage-like cells in the circumventricular receptors produce proinflammatory cytokines when their toll-like receptors are activated. While cytokines cannot easily cross the BBB, the circumventricular organs lie outside it and cytokines could potentially enter the brain through volume diffusion or sites where the BBB is compromised. Kinins can also disrupt BBB functioning and lead to neuropathological conditions related to cytokine entrance into the brain, such as depression.",0
5,36,"Using TNFa p55 receptor-KO mice, we investigated the relevance of TNFa in our experimental paradigm. Our results revealed that both depression-like behavior and upregulation of B1 receptors induced by forced swimming plus LPS treatment were almost eradicated in TNFa p55 receptor-KO mice. Our group had previously established the significance of TNFa for B1 receptors upregulation [14-17]. Our study provides explicit experimental evidence that links the cytokine TNFa with the kinin B1 receptor upregulation in depression genesis. Moreover, the findings demonstrate that pro-inflammatory cytokine generation plays a vital role in LPS-induced B1 receptor upregulation, as previously demonstrated [14].",0
5,37,"Depression is considered a syndrome, and new research suggests that molecules released during peripheral inflammatory events may influence central factors controlling behavior. The involvement of kinin B1 receptors in depressive alterations seems to be related to microglial activation, with subsequent production of TNFa in the brain. A clinical trial with orally available selective B1 receptor antagonists may be a potential treatment for depression symptoms.",0
6,1,"Type I interferons (IFNs) have a crucial function in the innate immune response and the development of adaptive immunity in the fight against viral infections. The production of type I IFNs (IFN-a/b) [1, 2] is stimulated by viral infections, which in turn activates numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These genes encode a range of antiviral proteins and cytokines, providing protection to the host from further viral infections [3, 4].",0
6,2,"In most mammalian nucleated cells, the main viral sensors are RNA helicases, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5). These sensors can recognize viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) can also recognize viral dsRNA in many cells. Once virus-derived nucleic acids bind to RIG-I, MDA-5, or TLR3, the transcription factor kappa B (NF-kB) interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) is activated, leading to IFN-b production in mammals.",0
6,3,"Despite the fact that host cells have developed multiple cellular signalling methods to detect and combat viral infection, viruses have mechanisms to evade these immune responses to varying degrees [7,11]. A multitude of viruses, for instance, have evolved methods to evade the IFN response by either inhibiting IFN synthesis or disrupting IFN functions [12].",0
6,4,"Research has demonstrated that the non-structural gene (NS) of influenza A viruses is accountable for the virus's ability to resist interferon (IFN) [13-16]. The NS gene that belongs to influenza A viruses contains the encoding for two proteins [17], one of which is a 26 kDa protein called non-structural protein 1 (NS1). This protein is formed through the translation of unspliced mRNA. The second protein, a 14 kDa nuclear export protein (NEP), earlier called NS2, develops after the translation of spliced mRNA [18].",0
6,5,"The NS1 protein prevents the activation of IFN-b [19,20] and hinders the functioning of various IFN-driven proteins like protein kinase R (PKR) and 2’-5’oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) [21-23].",0
6,6,"The NS gene has two different pools of alleles, labeled A and B [24,25]. NS1 proteins have a 63-68% nucleotide identity and 66-70% amino acid identity between allele A and B. Allele A is more widespread and is the only subtype seen in mammalian-adapted strains. When comparing amino acid sequences between avian allele A and B viruses and human viruses, six amino acid motifs were found between human and avian allele A viruses, and 35 motifs were found between human and allele B viruses [26]. This indicates that allele B viruses have a greater difference from mammalian-origin viruses. Thus, the NS1 adaptation is a significant factor in the pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses in mammals.",0
6,7,"Based on our previous research, we discovered a correlation between amino acid differences in the NS1 protein and the varying pathogenicity of H10 avian influenza viruses in minks (Mustela vison). Further experiments utilizing polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) stimulated mink lung cells showed that the NS1 protein of the influenza A virus isolated from minks (A/mink/Sweden/84 (H10N4)) had a greater impact on down-regulating type I IFN promoter activity compared to the NS1 protein from the prototype H10 virus (known as virus/N (A/chicken/Germany/N/49 (H10N7)). [27]",0
6,8,"The present investigation expands on our prior research by examining how the NS1 from diverse gene pools affects type I IFN promoter activity, IFN-b production, and the expression of IFN-b mRNA following exposure to poly I:C.",0
6,9,"We investigated the capacity of NS1 derived from ""mink/84"" and ""chicken/49"" to hinder the initiation of transcription of the IFN-b gene. To do so, we employed the ISRE-Luciferase model system and Poly I:C stimulation. This system depends on the expression of IFN and the resulting signaling from the IFN-a/b receptor, which prompts the expression of the ISRE reporter gene (luciferase). Although both NS1s displayed a noteworthy suppressive effect on luciferase activity, ""mink/84"" was much more potent, causing an average of 6.8 fold decline (85.3%) in A549 cells (Figure 1A). In comparison, ""chicken/49"" led to an average of 20.8% decrease in A549 cells.",0
6,10,"To determine whether the variation in inhibition of the IFNb promoter is caused by insufficient expression or difference in the NS1 proteins in A549 cells, western blot analysis was conducted to confirm the level of expressed NS1 proteins. Cells were lysed at various time points after transfection and the NS1 proteins from both constructs were expressed equally in high quantity. The level of allele A NS1 was comparable to that of allele B NS1 protein (Figure 1B). The western blotting revealed that the expressed protein from both “mink/84” and “chicken/49” was evenly accumulated in A549 cells and there was no noticeable difference between alleles in terms of NS1 production (Figure 1B). Therefore, the results suggested that the discrepancy in IFN-b induction in the presence of allele B NS1 protein was not due to differences in allele B NS1 protein expression and accumulation in the cells.",0
6,11,"It was uncertain whether the outcome was due to variations in the capacity to reduce IFN production or the impact on the ISRE transcription signaling path, or both. To resolve this, an ELISA was conducted to quantify IFN protein production.",0
6,12,"The protein IFN-b was found in the control cell medium after 2 to 4 hours of poly I:C stimulation, and it accumulated linearly in the cell culture supernatant. The highest levels in control cells were observed 16 to 24 hours post-stimulation. While low levels of IFN-b were secreted by cells transfected with different NS1s, there were significant differences between these NS1s, with ""mink/84"" virus producing at least 10 times less IFN-b than control cells. In these cells, IFN-b secretion reached its peak yield 8 hours after stimulation and then decreased rapidly. Conversely, cells expressing the NS1 protein of ""chicken/49"" were better producers of IFN-b, with a profile similar to the control cells. This suggests that in this system, NS1 suppresses IFN protein production rather than the signalling from the IFN receptor. (Figure 2A)",0
6,13,"In order to establish the cause of the decrease in IFN-b production, we evaluated the gene expression kinetics in A549 cells that were stimulated with poly I:C in the presence or absence of different NS1 proteins to assess if the IFN-b gene expression was being suppressed.",0
6,14,"In Figure 2B, IFN-b mRNA levels in the control cells increased throughout the experiment. This same pattern was observed in cells expressing the NS gene of ""chicken/49"" in Figure 2C. Transcript levels in the control cells were significantly higher 2 to 4 hours post-stimulation, reaching a plateau by the end of the experiment. Figure 2D shows that the NS1 protein of ""mink/84"" effectively suppressed IFN-b gene transcription in A549 cells 4 hours after stimulation. Transfection of plasmids carrying the NS gene of ""chicken/49"" resulted in increased levels of IFN-b mRNA, following a trend similar to the control cells.",0
6,15,The suppression of IFN-b gene transcription in A549 cells indicates that the NS1 protein of "mink/84" targets the induction of IFN. This was proven through RT-PCR analysis of the INF-b mRNA in stimulated A549 cells expressing NS1 of "mink/84" or "chicken/49".,0
6,16,"In order to evade host immune responses, influenza A viruses inhibit IFN-a/b expression or signalling to neighboring cells. This prevents the induction of an antiviral state through the stimulation of transcription from ISRE promoter-containing genes. The NS1 viral protein plays a crucial role in regulating innate immunity by inhibiting host immune responses through its two functional domains: an RNA binding domain and an effector domain. The effector domain interacts with cellular mRNA processing proteins, inhibits mRNA export and pre-mRNA splicing of host cell transcripts, and interacts with components of the nuclear pore complex and the mRNA export machinery. Meanwhile, the RNA binding domain binds to both single- and double-stranded RNA, inhibiting the activation and/or signalling of antiviral proteins, transcription factors involved in type I IFN and inflammatory cytokine signalling, and activators of mitogen-activated protein kinase.",0
6,17,"Our previous research has shown that the NS1 protein plays a crucial role in determining the pathogenicity of H10 avian influenza viruses in mink. To further investigate this, we utilized an expression plasmid system containing the ORF of NS1 from two avian influenza viruses, which differed in their pathogenicity levels in mink. These viruses also featured different NS alleles: one from A (""mink/84"") and the other from B (""chicken/49""). Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences revealed 71 differences between the two NS1 proteins. However, important amino acid residues for NS1 protein function were found to be similar between the two, as previously identified in infected cells.",0
6,18,"There was a single difference found between the NS1 proteins of ""mink/84"" and ""chicken/49"", concerning the site responsible for interaction with the CPSF30 subunit. This interaction typically inhibits the processing of cellular premRNA at the 3' end. There are two domains involved in this function: one around residue 186 and the other around residues 103 and 106. The NS1 protein of ""mink/84"" had Glu186, Phe103, and Met106, while the NS1 protein of ""chicken/49"" had Tyr103. Mutations at these interaction sites were shown to drastically alter the NS1's ability to regulate host gene expression in a previous study.",0
6,19,"""Both NS1 proteins from ""mink/84"" and ""chicken/49"" exhibited a negative impact on the activation of the ISRE promoter, as observed through luciferase activity. However, the reduction was considerably stronger in cells transfected with the ""mink/84"" NS1 plasmid, resulting in an average decrease of 85.3% in A549 cells. In contrast, pNS-chicken/49 caused an average decrease of 20.8% in A549 cells. The precise mechanism underlying this interference remains unknown, but it may involve inhibiting IFN induction signals via RIG-I, MDA-5, or TRL-3, suppressing IFN mRNA processing, or affecting downstream effects of IFN receptor signaling or luciferase mRNA processing.""",0
6,20,"According to various studies, the N-terminal RNA binding domain present in the NS1 protein is responsible for blocking the virus-induced activation of IFN-b promoter. The NS1 protein's three-dimensional structure and its function of suppressing IFN-b promoter activation can be affected by the 71 amino acid differences between the two NS1 proteins.",0
6,21,"The study examined the induction of IFN-b promoter and its correlation with the production of IFN-b. The research team investigated the level of endogenous IFN-b mRNA and the amount of IFN-b secreted in the cell supernatant. The NS1 protein of “mink/84” was found to strongly suppress the expression of the IFN-b gene and secretion of IFN-b in the cell culture supernatant. Time course study revealed that IFN-b production had three distinct phases: an initial rapid increase, a peak, and a decline to lower levels. The production of IFN-b and mRNA transcripts during poly I:C stimulation revealed an early upregulation, with maximal yields observed at 16 to 24 h post-stimulation. A549 cells expressing the NS1 protein of “mink/84” showed an upregulation of IFN-b mRNA transcripts during the first 4 h post-stimulation. (Figure 2A)",0
6,22,"Further studies are needed to examine the precise molecular mechanism underlying this finding. To accomplish this, animal experiments may be essential, as well as techniques such as reverse genetics, genomics and proteomic tools that permit the comprehensive investigation of various parameters associated with the intricate interplay between NS1 and the host innate immune system.",0
6,23,"All the indications imply that the distinct abilities of nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza viruses, derived from allele A and B, are linked to their ability to inhibit the induction of IFN mRNA; however, the exact working mechanism is unclear. Additionally, the study outcomes establish that the function of NS1 protein from different genetic gene pools have an impact on the production of a vital cytokine, IFN-b.",0
6,24,"The interaction of NS1 with inducing pathways, either one or both, is possible. It is also possible that there is a blockage in mRNA processing. To study the latter, it is recommended to investigate another inducible gene that is not IFN-dependent.",0

This suggests that compound 1i induces apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis also showed an increase in S and G2/M phases. The increase in S phase could be due to DNA synthesis stimulation or delay in cell movement from the S to G2/M phase.

Caspase-3 up-regulation was observed to be highest at 5.0 μM concentration, 12 hours after treatment, while caspase-6 activity peaked at the same concentration 24 hours after treatment. These effects were similar to those observed with camptothecin at 5.0 μM concentration. Figure 5a-b provides a graphical representation of these findings.",0
7,20,"The appearance of MOLT-4 cells was observed using light microscopy after being treated with compound 1i at concentrations of 5 and 10 μM for varying time periods. As the concentration of the compound and the incubation time increased, more apoptotic cells were observed. Figure 6b shows the characteristic features of apoptotic cells after incubating at a concentration of 10 μM for 36 hours, including chromatin margination, cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation/fragmentation, and cytoplasmic vacuole formation, which indicate apoptosis. Control cells, shown in Figure 6a, had larger nuclei with nucleoli.",0
7,21,"In the context of transmission electron microscopy, control cells of MOLT-4 were found to have a high ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm, with nuclear pores and nuclei that had finely dispersed chromatin. The mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes were visible in various sizes and shapes, including elongated and oval cristae (MC). Most cells had visible nucleoli. However, MOLT-4 cells exposed to 10 μM of compound 1i for 36 hours showed damaged mitochondrial cristae and significantly reduced rough endoplasmic reticulum, indicating apoptosis. No inflammation was observed in the nuclei and cytoplasm, and there was no evidence of necrotic events due to the absence of damage in the plasma membrane. There was vacuolization in the treated cells- observations that have been similarly reported in the scientific literature [16, 17].",0
7,22,"Studies were performed to determine if compound 1d and 1i, which share structural similarities with mitonafide, could inhibit tumor growth by inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis. To test this, tumor cells collected from mice were treated with the compounds and the amount of 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine incorporation was measured. The untreated cells demonstrated linear incorporation patterns, but exposure to the compounds at 8 μM resulted in significant inhibition of both nucleic acids, comparable to that of mitonafide at the same concentration. After 1 hour of incubation, compound 1d and 1i inhibited 3H-thymidine incorporation by 96% and 95%, respectively, whereas mitonafide inhibited incorporation by 95%. The compounds demonstrated marked inhibitory effects on DNA synthesis, while inhibition of RNA synthesis was less spectacular.  3H-uridine incorporation was inhibited by 92%, 94%, and 89% for mitonafide, compound 1d, and 1i, respectively. (Figure 8).",0
7,23,"The importance of a substituent's nature and position on a molecule's antitumor property has been established. In this study on substituted N-(hydroxyalkyl)naphthalimide, five different substituents (R = H, 6-Br, 6-Cl, 6-NO2, 5-NO2) in the aromatic ring portion were considered. It was found that the 6-NO2 substituent is crucial in exerting antitumor activity, which aligns with previous findings on other (chloroalkyl) naphthalimide compounds where 6-nitro-2-(3-chloropropyl) naphthalimide was the most effective agent. [7].",0
7,24,"Compound 1i exhibited significant antitumor activity and was found to interfere with the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle in MOLT-4 cells. The S phase is essential in preparing for cell division through DNA duplication. The flow cytometric measurements indicated that compound 1i hindered the S phase, thereby affecting DNA duplication of tumor cells before mitosis. This possibility was confirmed in S-180 cells where compound 1i inhibited 3 H-thymidine incorporation into DNA, indicating the suppression of DNA synthesis. Additionally, it also inhibited 3H-uridine uptake, concomitantly limiting RNA synthesis. These results suggest that the antitumor activity of compound 1i was attributed to the inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis.",0
7,25,"Observations from flow cytometry revealed that treatment with compound 1i resulted in a delay in exit from G2/M, the final phase of the cell cycle, in MOLT-4 cells. This delay can occur when there are defects in DNA damage repair, spindle attachment to centromeres, and polymerization of spindle microtubules. Consequently, the compound seems to have a negative impact on the mitotic apparatus by up-regulating spindle checkpoint control, which causes a delay in the mitotic exit of daughter cells. Studies have shown that vinca alkaloids and paclitaxel create antitumor effects by interfering with spindle microtubules, and it is possible that compound 1i exerts a similar mechanism of action.",0
7,26,"Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a common mechanism for several antitumor agents to combat cancer (source 21). In the case of Compound 1i, its antitumor action is also carried out through this pathway. This can be confirmed from the increase in sub-G1 fraction, the morphological evidence of apoptosis from light and electron microscopic studies, and the significant rise in caspase 3 and 6 levels in treated cells. There are various cell signals that control apoptosis, which may be generated intracellularly through the mitochondria or extracellularly via death receptors located on the cell's membrane. These two pathways eventually converge and create an irreversible execution phase enabled by caspase 3 and 6. It is unclear whether the pro-apoptotic signal caused by Compound 1i activated the intrinsic (mitochondrial) or extrinsic (death receptor) pathway. However, damage to the mitochondrial cristae in treated cells was observed, as seen in the ultrastructural study, implying that Compound 1i probably activates the mitochondrial pathway. Similar findings were reported for many naphthalimides, including amonafide and its analogs (source 22, 23).",0
7,27,"The study revealed that compound 1i displayed remarkable antitumor properties against murine S-180 tumor cells and a range of human tumor cell lines in vitro. This outcome was due to the inhibition of cell proliferation and promotion of programmed cell death. Furthermore, as the compound didn't induce any cytotoxic effects on normal human PBMC, it has the potential to be developed as an antitumor agent.",0
8,1,"Erlotinib, which falls under the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), has proven to be active and relatively well tolerated in elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not undergone chemotherapy [1]. As per studies, image-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and helical tomotherapy (HT) with hypofractionation is feasible and well tolerated for patients with early-stage medically inoperable NSCLC [2]. Similarly, for stage III NSCLC, hypofractionation has been observed to yield equivalent survival rates while avoiding often fatal symptomatic pneumonitis, as opposed to conventional radiotherapy [3]. Furthermore, the addition of standard-dose erlotinib to chemoradiotherapy is possible without increasing toxicity [4]. However, there is limited data on fatal pulmonary toxicity due to irradiation pneumonitis when erlotinib is given concurrently with SBRT and then used as maintenance therapy for NSCLC.",0
8,2,"The patient, an elderly man of 77 years, was diagnosed with stage IIIA NSCLC with cT2N2M0. A chest CT revealed a soft tissue mass of size 4 × 3.9 cm in the right upper lung, accompanied by mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was elevated to 12.9 mg/dl. He was initially treated with oral erlotinib 150 mg/day but after three months, the level of CEA increased to 29.1 ng/ml. Therefore, erlotinib was concurrently administered with radiotherapy - 54 Gy given in nine fractions provided with SBRT using HT, at 95% of the prescribed isodose for the planned target volume. The prescribed split courses were three fractions per week. Targeting was conducted based on new CT scans for each split course. (Refer to Figure 1 and 2)",0
8,3,"In the first treatment course, the tumor volume was 116.1 ml and the right lung volume was 1282.9 ml while in the second treatment course, the tumor volume was 90.9 ml and the right lung volume was 1475.9 ml. Table 1 shows the V15 and V20 which represent the percentage of lung volume that received at least × Gy [5], along with the mean lung dose. The whole-course V20 and mean lung dose for the total lung were 10% and 10.24 Gy, respectively. The tumor shrank from 4 × 3.9 × 4.5 cm to 2.4 × 2.9 × 2.1 cm after 2.5 months of combination therapy, and erlotinib 150 mg/day was prescribed for maintenance therapy. However, the patient developed dyspnea three months later and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit. Image studies revealed opacities of a diffuse ground-glass pattern, subpleural bleb formation in the marginal areas, airspace consolidation, and fibrosis in bilateral whole lung fields, which were indicative of radiation pneumonitis. Despite receiving empirical antibiotics, steroid therapy, antioxidant, and supportive treatment, the patient died of respiratory failure four months after the combined therapy.",0
8,4,"Image-guided SBRT with hypofractionation and HT for early-stage, medically inoperable NSCLC has been shown to be feasible, with equivalent survival rates and no fatal pneumonitis observed when compared to conventional radiotherapy. Belderbos et al. reported safe radiation dose escalation up to 94.5 Gy in 42 fractions, with a mean lung dose of 13.6 Gy or less. Using LQ modeling, the equivalent dose for hypofractionation was determined to be 6 Gy per fraction (EQD6), with acute and late normal tissue effects equivalent to 72 and 54 Gy, respectively. Careful monitoring of the V20, V15, and mean lung dose can help prevent radiation pneumonitis. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0236 protocol demonstrated safe and effective treatment when V20 was restricted to less than 10% to 15%. Table displays the V15, V20, and mean lung dose for each separate lung by divided course.",0
8,5,"Erlotinib is a type of EGFR TKI that has shown to be effective in treating NSCLC in elderly patients. While it can be used as a single agent in certain cases of advanced NSCLC, studies have found only a small percentage of patients developed interstitial lung disease when taking erlotinib. Additionally, when combined with chemoradiotherapy, erlotinib did not increase the risk of toxicities. However, it's important to note that prior tissue damage from radiation therapy may impact the response to erlotinib. Some studies have found that erlotinib can enhance radiation responses, including cell cycle arrest, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis induction, which may lead to altered cell responses when erlotinib is used after radiation.",0
8,6,"Although HT combined with SBRT can limit normal tissue exposure to high levels of radiation, there is a potential risk of harmful low-dose radiation affecting non-target organs at risk, such as the lungs, and causing toxicity. Recent research has shown that arc therapy may further exacerbate this phenomenon due to the low dose bath effect, which can be compounded by the presence of other agents known or unknown to cause recall effects. Additionally, both low-dose irradiation and the use of anticancer drugs can affect the pharmacokinetics of each other, which could lead to adverse effects even in off-target areas. In particular, studies have shown that EGFR inhibitors may enhance both the positive and negative effects of radiation, leading to issues like symptomatic pneumonitis and radiation recall dermatitis. This suggests that caution should be exercised in patients receiving concurrent treatment with radiation and EGFR inhibitors.",0
8,7,This is the inaugural report of erlotinib-associated radiation pneumonitis that arises with the combination of image-guided SBRT via HT with hypofractionation trailed by erlotinib for maintenance. Physicians should be mindful of the likelihood of serious lung toxicity that could occur as a result of this combined treatment. Any radiotherapy combined with targeting agents should only be carried out under well-structured clinical trials.,0

9,1,"Classical swine fever virus, a member of the genus Pestivirus in the Flaviviridae family, causes highly contagious classical swine fever in swine and wild boars. CSF viruses are divided into three major groups and ten subgroups by genetic typing. Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest a shift in the virus population from historical group 1/3 to recent group 2 in many European and Asian countries. Notably, all live-attenuated vaccine strains belong to group 1, including the Chinese lapinized vaccine strain (C-strain) which has been used since 1954. Recent studies indicate that subgroup 2.1 strains have emerged in China, branching away from the vaccine C-strain.",0
9,2,"E2, which is the primary envelope glycoprotein on the surface of the virion, plays a crucial role in initiating virus attachment and entry into host cells, as well as determining cell tropism. This particular glycoprotein has been identified as a key virulence determinant and can also prompt the production of neutralizing antibodies that can provide protective immunity to pigs. The antigenic structure of E2 has been mapped using monoclonal antibodies, revealing two distinct antigenic units in the N-terminal half of the protein. Although the C-terminal half doesn't significantly impact antibody binding, the first six conserved cysteine residues and the antigenic motif 771LLFD774 are both essential components of E2's antigenic structure.",0
9,3,"The extensive study of genetic diversity of E2 among different groups has been done, indicating that the antigenic units could be under positive selection due to constant exposure to high immunologic pressure. The N-terminal half of E2 is more variable than the C-terminal half, and different patterns of reactivity with mAbs provided clues of antigenic variation of E2 among different CSFV isolates. Studies using neutralizing mAbs to select mAb-resistant mutants showed that single point mutations could lead to complete loss of mAbs binding. Variability by one or more amino acids within antigenic units may result in the antigenic variation of E2. All studies that attempted to resolve antigenic variation of glycoprotein E2 utilized mouse mAbs, and no attempt has been made to probe the antigenic variation or group-specific antigenic determinants using anti-CSFV sera from the pig, the natural host of CSFV.",0
9,4,"In this research, pig antisera were utilized to analyze the degree of antigenic variation within antigenic units of glycoprotein E2 by raising it against CSFV vaccine C-strain and a representative subgroup 2.1 strain QZ-07. To determine whether the antigenic variation of E2 leads to differences in cross-neutralization, rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies were developed against recombinant E2 (rE2) protein from C-strain. Furthermore, a chain of variant C-strain rE2 proteins that contain single replacements based on amino acid variations between the C-strain and group 2 isolates were used to define residues that contribute to E2's antigenic variation.",0
9,5,"Prokaryotic-derived truncated rE2 proteins have been utilized in various applications such as antigen production, antigenic domain identification, and epitope mapping. In this particular study, two types of truncated rE2 proteins were expressed by E. coli Rosetta(DE3) cells, namely rE2-BC (aa 690-814) and rE2-AD (aa 690-865). The former covered N-terminal 123 residues known as the necessary antigenic domain for binding to pig anti-CSFV serum, while the latter contained both antigenic units B/C and A/D. Additionally, western blotting demonstrated that both proteins of the vaccine C-strain had the appropriate molecular weights of 20 and 25 kDa, respectively, and reacted strongly with pig anti-C-strain hyperimmune serum. As a result, prokaryotic-derived rE2 proteins were deemed appropriate for generating monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, as well as for antibody binding assessments.",0
9,6,"To evaluate how different the E2 antigen is between the subgroup 1.1 C-strain and subgroup 2.1 field isolates, they analyzed the respective rE2-AD proteins using ELISA with antisera obtained from pigs at different time intervals after vaccination with the C-strain vaccine or infection with strain QZ-07. As shown in Figure 2, every serum had a much stronger reaction with the rE2-AD protein of the homologous strain (used to generate the serum) than the heterologous strain. Moreover, Figure 3 compares the binding efficiency of anti-C-strain and anti-QZ-07 sera (gathered at 78 days post immunization with the C-strain and 25 days post infection with strain QZ-07, respectively) to rE2AD proteins produced from C-strain and 8 subgroup 2.1 strains. The homologous binding efficacy was put at 100%, and the anti-C-strain serum revealed considerably poor binding efficiency to subgroup 2.1 rE2-AD proteins (less than 60% efficiency). The binding of anti-Q7-07 serum to the C-strain rE2-AD protein was even less effective (less than 20% efficiency), and the band on the blot was barely visible. The binding of anti-QZ-07 serum to heterologous subgroup 2.1 proteins was diverse.",0
9,7,"The pig antiCSFV sera showed that heterologous neutralization was less effective in a two-way neutralization analysis, especially with sera collected at the early days following vaccination or infection (Figure 4). The efficiency of neutralization also varied between subgroup 2.1 strains QZ-07 and HZ1-08. As variation in strains affects the ability of antisera to neutralize heterologous viruses, we investigated whether variation of glycoprotein E2 affects CSFV cross-neutralization. A rabbit antiserum and three monoclonal antibodies were raised against C-strain rE2-AD protein. The rabbit antiserum neutralized the QZ-07 virus less efficiently than the C-strain. Furthermore, mutagenesis of cysteine residues in the antigenic unit B/C affected the reactivity of mAbs 1E7 and 6B8 to E2, but not of mAb 2B6. These results indicate that cysteine residues are involved in the structural conformation of E2 and that mAbs 1E7 and 6B8 bind to conformational epitopes. Though mAb 2B6 only bound to C-strain, its neutralization efficiency was low. (Table 2).",0
9,8,The identification of the amino acid residues that cause the observed changes in antigenicity was done by aligning E2 sequences of 108 CSFV strains representing each cluster obtained from GenBank. The analysis revealed twenty significant variable residues in the antigenic units. The extent of variability of these residues between vaccine strains and group 2 representative strains is shown in Table 3.,0
9,9,"We performed site-directed mutagenesis to switch out amino acids in C-strain E2 protein with those seen in subgroup 2.1 proteins (as listed in Table 3, second to last row). Using binding ELISA, we assessed the binding of wild type and variant C-strain rE2 proteins to C-strain and strain QZ-07 antisera. The wells of plates were coated with equal amounts of proteins and the antibodies were saturated to prevent limiting antibody concentration. The wt C-strain rE2 protein binding served as a control at 100%. None of the substitutions altered the binding of the variant rE2 proteins to antiC-strain serum significantly (with binding efficiency between 80% and 130%), indicating that individual residues did not play a major role in the protein's overall binding to antibodies (as shown in Figure 5A). However, thirteen substitutions did result in increased binding of variant C-strain rE2 proteins to anti-QZ-07 serum (i.e., over 150% binding efficiency threshold). Substitutions of D705N, L709P, G713E, N723S, or S779A led to a significant increase in binding efficiency (over 200% threshold), whereas a mild increase was noted with D725G, N729D, N777S, T780I, D847E, M854V, T860I, or N863K substitution (with efficiency between 150% and 200%).",0
9,10,"The residues that led to notable or moderate improvement in the binding efficiency were divided into three separate clusters within the antigenic units, as shown in Figure 1A. The first group was located at the N-terminus of antigenic unit B/C, specifically at amino acid positions 702-731. The second cluster was situated at the boundary that separates the two antigenic units, spanning positions 774-799. The third and final cluster was in the C-terminus of antigenic unit A/D, covering positions 841-864. Interestingly, the analysis of hydrophilicity revealed that these regions contributed to the significant hydrophilic differences between the CSFV C-strain and strain QZ-07, as illustrated in Figure 5C.",0
9,11,"To gain more understanding about the evolution of antigenic units, the codon and amino acid diversity was examined using a variant Simpson's index. The results, depicted in Figure 6, reveal that thirteen residues linked to antigenic variation (as shown in Figure 5 and Table 3) are highly diversified due to a large accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations in their codons. These residues fall along the diagonal (x = y). However, the six cysteine residues and the residues in the 771LLFD774 motif exhibit high conservation, even though their codons have accumulated a moderate number of synonymous mutations. Consequently, they lie along the x-axis. Conversely, the antigenic residues revealed by the analysis of mAb-resistant mutants are mapped as having a random distribution (Figure 6).",0
9,12,"Phylogenetically, CSFV consists of three major groups, and recent studies have shown a shift in viral populations from historical groups 1 or 3 to group 2 in most European and Asian countries. The E2 glycoprotein, which is a principal target of neutralizing antibodies and an important immunogen, differs both genetically and antigenically in the three groups. Despite this variation, the molecular basis for it has yet to be clearly demonstrated.",0
9,13,"The data indicates that pig anti-C-strain and anti-QZ07 sera do not bind heterologous rE2-AD proteins as efficiently compared to homologous proteins, suggesting antigenic differences. Additionally, the E2 protein of vaccine C-strain is distinct from other subgroup 2.1 strains. This antigenic variation was also observed among subgroup 2.1 strains. The study further confirms previously reported antigenic differences detected by mouse mAbs in the context of pig anti-CSFV sera.",0
9,14,"The efficiency of antibody binding to rE2 proteins was tested through neutralization experiments in order to determine if it correlated with the ability to block CSFV infection. The results showed that pig anti-CSFV sera and rabbit polyclonal antibodies were less efficient at neutralizing heterologous strains, and two conformational anti-C-strain-rE2-AD mAbs had lower binding and neutralization efficiency against heterologous strains compared to C-strain. These differences suggest that antigenic variation in E2 glycoproteins may explain why subgroup 2.1 CSFV strains persist in China despite the use of vaccine C-strain, and antibody selection may be a factor in the switch of viral populations from group 1 to 2.",0
9,15,"Using site-directed mutagenesis, we introduced amino acid substitutions in the C-strain rE2 proteins to investigate whether variable residues (listed in Table 3) contribute to the observed antigenic variation in subgroup 2.1 strains. No significant effect on binding to anti-C-strain serum was found for any of the substitutions except for mutations in the antigenic motif 771LLFD774 that disrupted the structural integrity of E2 protein. This suggests that the recombinant proteins were not grossly misfolded and the substituted residues might not be crucial for the structural stability of glycoprotein E2. On the other hand, out of the 20 substitutions, 13 enhanced the binding of the variant C-strain rE2 proteins to anti-QZ-07 serum, with the most significant increase observed for the GtoE substitution at aa position 713. Interestingly, sequence alignment showed that all group 2 strains have residue 713E, while all vaccine strains have 713G, indicating that 713E is a common antigenic determinant for both groups 2 and 3. It was also recently reported that residues 713E and 729D are critical for the specificity of a group 3.4 field strain rE2 protein to mAbs.",0
9,16,"Our findings indicate that residue 729D was beneficial for binding to pig anti-QZ-07 serum, but residues 705N, 709P, 723S, and 779A had a more significant impact (Figure 5A). Of note, these same residues are present at positions 705 and 723 on E2 proteins of subgroup 2.1 and subgroup 3.4 strains. It is possible that these two residues may play a crucial role in the antigenicity of subgroup 3.4 glycoprotein E2 if examined with pig antisera against group 3 strains. In this study, we employed polyclonal sera from pigs that were infected with a field strain or immunized with the C-strain, which resulted in a full range of antibodies created as a result of immunization or infection. This is why these polyclonal sera were capable of uncovering more residues responsible for glycoprotein E2 antigenic variation than mouse mAbs [35]. Additionally, using a combination of polyclonal antisera against the group 1 C-strain and representative group 2 field strain allowed us to detect the residues responsible for antigenic variation between these two groups, which is yet another advantage over mAbs.",0
9,17,"According to the site-directed mutagenesis analysis (Figure 5A), it is not surprising that there is antigenic variation among subgroup 2.1 strains since each of the 8 strains used in this study has unique strain-specific substitutions (data not shown). The substitution of C737R in strain QZ2-06 affects binding the most, likely due to the critical role of the cysteine residue at this position for the antigenic structure of the protein. The E782V substitution in strain HZ1-08 may be the determinant of antigenic variation between this strain and the reference subgroup 2.1 strain QZ-07, as speculated.",0
9,18,"Three distinct areas of antigenicity within the E2 protein have been identified at amino acid positions 702-731, 774-799 and 841-864, as shown in Figure 1A. The 702-731 region appears to be the primary driver of antigenic variation, as evidenced by the clustering of antibody-resistant mutants and epitopes with increased binding in this area. The 774-799 region contains both a conserved antigenic motif (771LLFD774) and a linear epitope (772LFDGTNP778) that contribute to the overall integrity of the E2 antigenic structure. Substitutions at positions N777S, S779A, and T780I within this region have also been found to enhance binding to anti-QZ-07 serum, suggesting multiple functions for the 774-799 region in determining E2 antigenicity.",0
9,19,"We used E2 sequences of CSFV for comparative analysis of codon and amino acid diversification with respect to antigenic evolution. To quantify this diversity, we adopted a variant Simpson's index, previously used for influenza virus hemagglutinin glycoprotein. Our analysis revealed that the diversity of both codons and amino acid residues was equal for each of the thirteen residues associated with antigenic variation. This observation suggests a strong correlation between the genetic and antigenic evolution of the E2 glycoprotein in natural conditions. However, the antigenic residues identified by analysis of mAb-resistant mutants showed random diversification, indicating that in vitro selection may not be a valid explanation for natural selection in pigs. Along with extensive vaccination, co-diversification of codons and amino acids could be a mechanism adopted by CSFV to evade the immune system under immune pressure.",0
9,20,"This research displays how the glycoprotein E2 in CSFV can vary between the vaccine C-strain and group 2 field strains or even within the same group of strains currently circulating in China. The main determinants of this variation were substitutions found in the first region (aa 702-731) of the three identified regions. These substitutions affect cross-neutralization of CSFV, and further research is needed to determine whether these residues contribute to the observed differences in neutralization. The results of this study could be useful for the development of new serological assays and CSF vaccines that are more effective and immunogenic.",0
9,21,"ST cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Three CSFV strains were used, including the subgroup 1.1 vaccine C-strain from Zhejiang Jianliang Biological Engineering Company and two subgroup 2.1 strains (QZ-07 and HZ1-08) isolated from naturally infected pigs and replicated in the laboratory. The viruses were sequenced for the E2 gene and their stocks were stored at -80°C. The E2 genes of the other six subgroup 2.1 strains were cloned without isolation. Sequence data is available in GenBank and detailed molecular phylogenetic relationships can be found elsewhere. Table 3 lists the strains in GenBank.",0
9,22,"E2 sequences covering the entire antigenic region were obtained from the NCBI database and aligned using Clustal X software. Sequences with 100% nucleotide identity were removed, and the resulting dataset included 23, 82, and 3 sequences for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This dataset was used to identify significant variable residues (as listed in Table 3) and to assess the codon and amino acid diversity (shown in Figure 6).",0
9,23,"Plasmids containing the complete E2 gene of the C-strain vaccine and eight subgroup 2.1 strains were utilized in this study and were previously described. Two primer sets, C-E2-AD-f/C-E2-AD-r and C-E2BC-f/C-E2-BC-r, were used to amplify the fragment covering the two antigenic units (B/C+A/D) and the fragment only containing antigenic unit B/C. Another primer set, QZ-E2-AD-f/QZ-E2-AD-r, was used to amplify fragments covering the two antigenic units of group 2 isolates listed in Table 1. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes, gel purified, and then ligated into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-30a(+). To create the eukaryotic expression plasmid, a 1212-bp cDNA fragment that encoded the signal sequence and complete E2 of the C-strain was amplified and cloned into pcDNA3.1 after being digested with BamHI and XhoI.",0
9,24,"E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells harboring various recombinant plasmids were grown until they reached an optical density between 0.6 and 0.8 at 600 nm. His-tagged rE2 proteins were induced by adding 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG, Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were then ruptured by sonication and centrifuged, and the inclusion bodies containing rE2 proteins were resuspended in 1/10 volume of a buffer containing 100 mM NaH2PO4·2H2O, 10 mM Tris-base, and 8 M urea. The supernatant was collected through centrifugation and purified according to the manufacturer's protocol using a Ni-NTA affinity column (Novagen, Madison, WI). Finally, the proteins were refolded by washing the column with 40 ml of Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4) containing 1 M urea and eluted with 200 mM imidazole in TBS. The purified rE2 proteins were verified by Western blotting with mouse monoclonal anti-His-tag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and quantified using the Bradford assay.",0
9,25,"The laboratory previously prepared the pig hyperimmune serum for the CSFV vaccine C-strain, which was stored. The pig anti-C-strain and pig anti-QZ-07 were induced in CSFV-free pigs through intramuscular immunization with the attenuated vaccine C-strain and infection with 10 5 TCID50 of strain QZ-07 in a biosafety level III facility using a prime-boost strategy. The sera collected at different times post-vaccination or infection were stored at -80°C until use, and the highest titers of collected sera were used for binding ELISAs and Western blots in Figure 3A, 3B, 5A, and 5B, taken at 78 days post immunization with the C-strain and 25 days post infection with strain QZ-07 as shown in Figure 2.",0

The rabbits were immunized and boosted twice, and once the maximum level of antibody production was reached, blood was drawn for antiserum preparation.",0
9,27,"For the production of monoclonal antibodies targeting the rE2-AD protein of C-strain, female specific-pathogen-free BALB/c mice aged 5 weeks received subcutaneous immunization of 0.1 mg purified rE2-AD protein of vaccine C-strain emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant. The mice subsequently received two intraperitoneal boosts of the protein emulsified in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant at 2-week intervals. After 2 weeks from the last boost, spleen cell harvest was carried out following the euthanasia of the mice. The harvested splenocytes were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells using 50% polyethylene glycol. Through selection via immunofluorescence assay (IFA), hybridomas that secrete antibodies against rE2AD were selected, and then further clonally expanded. Antibody subtyping was carried out using mouse mAb Isotyping Reagents based on manufacturers’ instructions from Sigma-Aldrich. Ascites were then produced in pristine-primed BALB/c mice, and the animal experiments were approved by the Laboratory Animal Management Committee, who is responsible for upholding animal welfare ethics.",0

The antigenic units were analyzed and 20 major variable residues were identified, but KtoR or StoT substitutions were not counted among them. To exchange C-strain residues with those from group 2 isolates, individual mutations listed in Table 3 were incorporated into plasmids using site-directed mutagenesis.

For D847E, M854V, T860I, and N863K substitutions which are in the antigenic unit A/D, rE2-AD proteins were used. The results were normalized to anti-His-tag binding and expressed as the ratio of their binding to the antibodies to that of binding to C-strain wild type rE2-BC or rE2-AD binding to the reference serum depending on the variant protein being compared. A relative binding of greater than 200% efficiency was significant, between 150% and 200% efficiency was moderate, and between 50% and 150% efficiency was considered to have limited effect on antibody binding.",0
9,34,"The antigenic reactivity of various rE2 proteins was evaluated via Western blotting. The proteins were separated by a 15% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes obtained from PALL Corp., USA. The next step involved blocking the membranes overnight at 4°C using blocking buffer (PBS/NFDM) before incubating them with diverse antibodies at 37°C for one hour. Following the incubation, the membranes were rinsed in PBS/Tween for 20 minutes, and then SPA-conjugated with horseradish peroxidase diluted at 1:2500 was used to detect bound antibodies. 4-chloro-1-naphthol (4-CN, SigmaAldrich) was used to facilitate color development.'",0

10,1,"Breast cancer has both genetic and nongenetic causes. Genome-wide association studies have led to the identification of several common genetic susceptibility variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at FGFR2, LSP1, MAP3K1, TOX3, MRPS30, COX 11, SLC4A7, and at chromosomes 8p24 and 2q35. The only SNP that has been associated with breast cancer risk with genome-wide statistical significance (P < 10 -7 ) from candidate gene approaches is CASP8. There is some equivocal evidence for SNPs in TGFB1 and ESR1, among others.",0
10,2,"Determining how common SNPs combine with other known risk factors is crucial in understanding the influence on breast cancer risk. These risk factors include age at menarche, parity, age at first birth and body mass index (BMI) [8,9]. By doing so, risk prediction models [10,11] can be improved. Additionally, identifying modifications of SNP associations by other risk factors can shed light on genetic variants' role in breast cancer etiology. Moreover, it has been observed that many of these SNPs and risk factors have differential associations with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative disease [1,4,5,7,12,13], and interactions between them may differ by disease subtype.",0
10,3,"The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect modification of 12 SNPs, out of which 10 were already linked to breast cancer risk, and the remaining 2 had less clear evidence. We considered several potential effect modifiers such as age at menarche, live births, BMI, and evaluated these interactions in susceptibility to different subtypes of breast cancer based on ER and PR status. We combined data from 21 case-control studies of white women of European ancestry who participated in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC).",0
10,4,"Table 1 provides a brief description of the 21 case-control studies that participated in the pooled BCAC analysis, while more detailed information can be found in Additional Data Table S1 in Additional file 1. Out of these, 11 were population-based studies, and seven had at least 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls. Case and control self-reported data were collected on various factors such as age, race/ethnicity, BMI, age at menarche, and number of live births, with the time-point of assessment provided in Additional Data Table S1. Notably, information on additional risk and lifestyle factors were not available during the analysis, except for the CNIO-BCS and LMBC studies, which relied on medical records for their data. Finally, information on ER and PR tumor status was available for a subset of cases in 19 studies, with data mostly taken from medical records.",0
10,5,"Methods for genotyping have been previously explained in various studies, including five that utilized the MassARRAY system and iPLEX technology by Sequenom for most SNPs. Other genotyping was performed using Taqman® Assays-byDesignSM. It has been reported that SNP CASP8-rs17468277 is in complete linkage disequilibrium with CASP8-rs1045485, which has been linked to breast cancer. Measures were taken to ensure accuracy, including at least one blank well per assay plate, duplicates of at least 2% of the samples, and a common set of 93 samples from the Centre d’Etude Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) that were utilized by the HapMap Consortium. Samples that repeatedly failed were excluded from the call rates and duplicate concordance rates calculated, both of which were greater than 95%. The concordance with CEPH genotypes was greater than 98%.",0
10,6,"Genetic associations for each of the 12 SNPs were analyzed by logistic regression, estimating odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the risk allele assuming multiplicative per-allele effects (refer to Table 2). Logistic regression was used to assess the main effects of risk factors in the 11 population-based studies, with adjustments for age (categorical and continuous) and study (categorical). Risk factors evaluated include age at menarche (categorical and continuous), live birth history (yes or no), number of live births (categorical and continuous), age at first birth (categorical and continuous), and BMI (categorical and continuous).",0
10,7,"Given that BMI has been shown to have different associations with breast cancer risk in premenopausal and postmenopausal women, we looked at the impact of BMI separately for women aged below 55 years (considered as premenopausal) and those aged 55 years and above (postmenopausal). To do this, we used logistic regression models that adjusted for appropriate risk factors and included dummy variables to examine the per-allele odds ratios (ORs) for SNPs. We did not present estimates obtained using a younger age limit (50 years) since these were similar to those obtained using the age categories as surrogates for pre- and post-menopausal status.",0
10,8,"Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the interaction or alteration of genetic associations by other risk factors. Each model consisted of dummy variables for the study and three parameters: one for the per-risk-allele effect, one for the primary risk factor effect (all modeled as continuous variables, except for ever having had a live birth), and one for the interaction term, which is the product of the number of risk alleles and the value of the risk factor. A likelihood ratio test was performed to compare this model with and without the interaction term to test the statistical significance. In addition, the effect modification by BMI was analyzed separately for women who were age <55 and ≥55 years.",0
10,9,"A method called parametric bootstrap test was utilized to compute interaction P-values adjusted for multiple testing. For all 72 interactions tested, the team determined the probability of being a case for each subject based on the logistic regression model incorporating only main effects. To be exact, study (categorical), SNP (per-allele), and risk factor (continuous, except ever having had a live birth) were taken into account. Each bootstrap replicate included generating a dummy case-control status for each subject and fitting the interaction model mentioned above. The minimum P-value was recorded for 10,000 replicates, and adjusted P-values were calculated as the proportion of replication P-values below the corresponding unadjusted P-value. [15]",0
10,10,"The statistical analyses were conducted using Stata, Release 10 (Statacorp, College Station, TX, USA) [16], except for power calculations, which were performed with Quanto (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA) [17,18].",0
10,11,"The sample included 26,349 cases and 32,208 controls of self-reported white European race/ethnicity from 21 participating studies. All participants had available data for at least one of the 12 SNPs considered and one of the other risk factors considered. Out of these, 17,603 cases from 18 studies were interviewed within two years of their breast cancer diagnosis, while 29,187 controls came from the same 18 studies. Roughly 46% of cases and 38% of controls were under the age of 55. Additionally, the ER and PR statuses were known for 19,561 and 16,962 cases, respectively. The details of the study are provided in Table 1. Overall, 12,822 cases and 19,703 controls with minimal data were included from 11 population-based studies, and 16,107 cases and 23,140 controls with minimal data were included from seven studies with at least 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls.",0
10,12,"The risk factors expectedly showed associations with breast cancer in population-based studies, except for one. With age and study adjustment, a 4% decrease in breast cancer risk was associated with each one-year increase in age at menarche, and parous women had a 16% decreased risk. Each additional live birth was linked to an 11% decreased risk for parous women, while a 7% increased risk was associated with every five-year increment in age at first birth. Obesity (BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m^2) was linked to a 20% lower risk of breast cancer among women under 55 years old. The only unexpected observation was that obesity was not associated with breast cancer risk in women aged 55 years and older (OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.04).",0
10,13,"Table 2 displays the per-allele ORs and their corresponding 95% CIs for the 12 SNPs examined in this study. It provides data for all included participants with genotype information as well as for subgroups of women categorized by the four risk factors being analyzed. The ORs for all groups were adjusted for study, and those for subsets were additionally adjusted for age and the relevant risk factor. The overall ORs and those for subsets were similar, indicating that there was no confounding by the risk factors or bias in OR estimates due to data availability.",0
10,14,The per-allele OR for the majority of SNP/risk factor combinations was not found to vary by category of the risk factor. These results were consistent across all studies and when analyses were restricted to population-based studies and those with high case and control numbers. Restricting analyses to studies with cases interviewed within two years of breast cancer diagnosis had little effect on the results. Results were also null when analyses were limited to ER-positive and ER-negative or PR-positive and PR-negative breast cancers. These findings are detailed in Additional Data Tables S2 to S8 in Additional file 1.,0
10,15,"The association between 11p15-rs3817198 (LSP1) and breast cancer risk may be modified by the number of live births a woman has had, with a stronger effect observed in women who have had four or more live births. This trend was seen in population-based studies and in studies with at least 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls. The interaction was significant for ER-positive and PR-positive breast cancer, but not for ER-negative and PR-negative breast cancer. However, since multiple tests were performed, the possibility of chance cannot be ruled out as an explanation for these results. The multiple-test-adjusted P-value for this specific interaction was 0.12, while all other interactions tested had adjusted p-values of ≥0.61.",0
10,16,"The post-hoc power calculations indicated that our study had 90% power at a significance level of 0.0007 to detect interaction ORs of at least 1.06, with the exception of the CASP8-rs17468277 locus, for which the minimum was 1.08. The study could also detect interaction ORs of at least 1.08 and 1.10 for BMI and the more common variants, respectively. For parity, the study had similar power to detect interaction ORs of at least 1.20 for the CASP8-rs17468277 locus and 1.16 for the other loci when considering live birth history.",0
10,17,"According to the analysis of over 25,000 cases and 30,000 controls, there is no conclusive evidence that factors such as age at menarche, parity, age at first birth, or BMI impact the established associations of breast cancer risk with various genetic variants. These variants include 10q26rs298158 (FGFR2), 8q24-rs13281615, 11p15-rs3817198 (LSP1), 5q11-rs889312 (MAP3K1), 16q12-rs2803662 (TOX3), 2q35-rs13387042, 5p12-rs10941679, 17q23rs6504950, 3p24-rs4973768, and CASP8-rs17468277. Additionally, there is no evidence that these factors impact potential associations with TGFB1-rs1982073 or ESR1rs3020314. These findings also hold true for disease subtypes defined by ER and PR status.",0
10,18,"The most compelling evidence of effect modification was found for the number of live births and a specific gene variant known as 11p15-rs3817198 (LSP1). However, the observed trend of increasing relative risk with increasing parity was not statistically significant once multiple testing was taken into account. It is important to note that the interaction odds ratio (OR) was only 1.05 per allele and per live birth, meaning that the estimated per-allele OR only increased from 1.04 for women with one child to 1.24 for women with four or more children, for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with an average OR of 1.08 across all levels of parity. The weak interactions observed here would only lead to very small differences in joint effects estimates when compared to models that assume multiplicative effects. This finding highlights the challenge of detecting modifying effects of this size in very large studies.",0
10,19,"A recent study conducted by Travis et al. found no interaction between breast cancer susceptibility, 9 genetic loci, and 10 risk factors, including age at menarche, BMI, parity, and age at first birth. This null result was replicated in our study, which had a larger sample size of women over age 50 and also included women under 50. Our study expanded on Travis et al.'s research by evaluating genetic loci such as 17q23rs6504950, 3p24-rs4973768, and ESR1-rs3020314, which were not originally included. Additionally, we used a more strongly associated SNP (rs10941679) for the susceptibility locus at 5p12 instead of rs981782. Lastly, Travis et al. found no evidence of interaction between 11p15rs3817198 (LSP1) and number of children.",0
10,20,"One advantage of the BCAC is the extensive sample size acquired through international collaboration. This has been beneficial in either confirming or ruling out association with breast cancer for common SNPs discovered through GWAS and candidate gene studies. The consortium has also been able to provide precise estimates of the odds ratios associated with susceptibility alleles, with consistency observed between the numerous studies that participate in the group, despite the range of study designs utilized. However, because multiple studies that recruited selected cases and/or volunteer controls were included, the primary effects of some risk factors may not be appropriately evaluated across the whole cohort. Nevertheless, potential selection bias in estimating primary effects should not affect the assessment of interactions. Nonetheless, we carried out sensitivity analyses considering only data from population-based studies and only data from studies with at least 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls and observed no significant change in the results obtained regarding interactions.",0
10,21,"Our study's limitation comes from the fact that there were varied data collection methods across studies. Structured questionnaires were used in all studies, except for two which were not population-based. These questionnaires were administered through various means such as in-person interviews, phone interviews or self-administration. However, while some heterogeneity in data collection methods may have affected our results for BMI, other measurements such as age at menarche, ever having had a live birth, number of live births and age at first birth should be reliable despite these variances. We did conduct standardized measurement within studies and adjusted for study as a covariate to limit any systematic bias. We also excluded cases interviewed before or more than two years after their breast cancer diagnosis and obtained similar results, indicating that varying reference times for BMI reporting did not affect our study. Nonetheless, we did find our study's limitation in not collecting information on hormone therapy (HT) use to evaluate interactions between SNPs and BMI in older women.",0
10,22,"Through the largest collaborative analyses of gene-environment interactions that have been carried out so far, it has been observed that there is no conclusive evidence for the modification of per-allele relative risk associated with common breast cancer susceptibility variants by age at menarche, parity, age at first birth or BMI. The results are in line with the findings of a recent smaller prospective study. Therefore, the combined effects of these common susceptibility alleles and other established risk factors are assumed to be multiplicative in risk predicted models for breast cancer.",0
11,1,"Anopheles funestus is the primary carrier of malaria in the southern African region. According to early research, it was responsible for transmitting the Plasmodium falciparum parasite at an alarming rate of 22% in South Africa [1]. However, in more recent studies, the infection rate has dropped to 11% in Tanzania [2] and 5% in southern Mozambique [3].",0
11,2,"An extensive indoor residual spraying campaign using DDT in the 1950s resulted in the eradication of An. funestus in South Africa. This species was only recorded once during a small malaria outbreak in the north of the country over the next 50 years. However, in 1999/2000, An. funestus reappeared during the worst malaria outbreak since the use of IRS. It was found in northern KwaZulu/Natal, just south of Mozambique, with a P. falciparum parasite rate of 5.4% and resistance to both pyrethroids and carbamates.",0
11,3,"According to later studies conducted in southern Mozambique, it was revealed that the group of An. funestus with insecticide resistance expanded beyond the capital Maputo [7-9]. The latest research indicated that this resistance is also present in An. funestus from Chokwe [10], located about 200 kilometers north of the capital, even though this group was once believed to be susceptible [8].",0
11,4,"Evidence of insecticide resistance in An. funestus has been discovered in an island located in Lake Malawi, which is significantly farther north compared to any previous records of resistance.",0
11,5,"A survey was conducted on Likoma Island in Lake Malawi (12°04’S, 34°44’E) from 10 - 14 May 2010 (Figure 1) to collect data on mosquitoes. The island is made up of several rocks, and the residents mainly engage in fishing and small-scale subsistence farming, living in scattered homesteads. The researchers searched a large number of houses for mosquitoes but were mostly unsuccessful. However, they discovered a significant population of An. funestus in a few houses near a small area where rice was being grown.",0
11,6,"Mosquitoes were captured while at rest indoors using a hand-held aspirator. A portion of the specimens were promptly employed for WHO susceptibility trials, whereas the remainder were packaged and transported to Johannesburg to procure egg clusters. These eggs were subsequently nurtured into F-1 adults.",0
11,7,"To identify the species, the procedures outlined by Koekemoer et al. [11] and Scott et al. [12] were employed for the An. funestus group and An. gambiae complex respectively.

11,9,"One hundred and eleven female An. funestus from the wild with unknown ages were assessed for resistance to insecticides in field conditions without regulating temperature or humidity. Approximately 6 female An. gambiae complex mosquitoes, along with over 120 female and male An. funestus, and a small number of An. gambiae larvae, were collected and transported to a laboratory in Johannesburg.",0
11,10,"A total of 223 An. funestus were tested using molecular assays, which included all wild adult mosquitoes used in susceptibility tests (n = 111), as well as live females brought back to the laboratory for egg laying (n = 112). Out of the total, 97.3% were successfully identified as An. funestus s.s. (five specimens did not amplify a PCR product and one specimen was identified as An. funestus-like). All males and females in the An. gambiae complex, including both wild adults and those that were reared from larvae (n = 89), were identified as An. arabiensis.",0
11,11,"Out of the 81 female An. funestus that were examined for the presence of parasites, 4.9% tested positive for P. falciparum through the ELISA technique.",0
11,12,"The results of the initial tests carried out on the island involve insecticide susceptibility. Wild female An. funestus of unknown age was used, and the outcomes are shown in Table 1. To correct the results, Abbott's formula [14] was used as the controls yielded >5% mortality. The results showed 77.8% mortality on deltamethrin and 56.4% on bendiocarb. Furthermore, the field papers were checked in the laboratory with a susceptible An. gambiae colony, and all samples and replicates (n = 100 for each insecticide) showed 100% mortality.",0
11,13,"The laboratory performed the second cycle of insecticide susceptibility tests, using 1-5 day old An. funestus females that were pooled from around 120 egg batches, and conducted the experiment at 25°C and 85% RH. They tested nine insecticides from each of the four categories, and the test outcomes can be found in Table 2.",0
11,14,The susceptibility tests could not be conducted in a significant way since there were only 42 female specimens of An. arabiensis that were bred from larvae.,0
11,15,"The difference in deltamethrin susceptibility tests between wild females in the field and laboratory reared F-1 progeny, aged 1-5 days old (p <0.005), can be explained in two ways. Firstly, exposure to high temperatures can affect the survival of mosquitoes, causing high mortality rates in field samples. Secondly, An. funestus may exhibit age-dependent susceptibility to this sub-class of pyrethroids. As the survey was conducted at the end of the transmission season, it is likely that aging wild-caught females in the field were more susceptible to insecticides. However, Hunt et al. report that blood-fed, mated females did not show any decrease in resistance over time, and aging wild populations are likely to be mated and have had several blood meals.",0
11,16,"It is evident from the susceptibility findings that a plan for resistance management is necessary to tackle malaria on Likoma Island. To control resistance, pyrethroid treated bed nets should be distributed extensively, accompanied by IRS with an organophosphate or DDT. However, carbamates cannot be used due to their high survival frequency. An. funestus seems entirely susceptible to DDT, suggesting that DDT could be used for IRS in rotation with one of the organophosphates.",0
11,17,"The island already has a high usage of bed nets, which vary in age and effectiveness. Despite their availability, many residents do not use them consistently. To implement a bed net and IRS combination approach successfully, education and monitoring of net usage is crucial. When mosquito populations decrease, some individuals may abandon net use. Additionally, fishermen may repurpose nets for their livelihood. (Refer to Figure 2 for more information.)",0
11,18,"The discovery of pyrethroid and carbamate resistance in the An. funestus population approximately 1,500 km north of its current known distribution in southern Mozambique is the most worrying aspect of this survey (Figure 1) [10]. An earlier report by Casimiro et al. [9] in 2006 showed that An. funestus had greater than 95% mortality to pyrethroids and carbamates in central Mozambique. While this percentage of susceptibility requires further investigation per the WHO criteria, it is unlikely that a control program would change its policy based solely on this frequency of resistance/susceptibility.",0
11,19,"Likoma Island, situated in Lake Malawi and nearby Mozambique, potentially introduces mosquitoes through wind or boats to its mainland. The resistance of An. funestus population in Northern Mozambique must also be considered, hindering current malaria control efforts in the region. Similar to the southerly populations, both pyrethroid and carbamate resistance is present in the Likoma population, spreading through gene flow in An. funestus populations as opposed to genetic mutation events. The lack of physical barriers to gene flow suggests that resistance will progress northwards into southern Tanzania and westwards into Zambia and Zimbabwe. Conversely, the resistance found in An. funestus from Uganda differs from that observed in southern African populations. This variation is apparent in susceptibility tests and molecular characterization of P450 genes.",0
11,20,The rapid spread of insecticide resistance in An. funestus in southern Africa is a serious issue that this paper emphasizes. There is an urgent need for resistance management strategies within malaria vector control programmes in the region.',0
12,1,"Angiogenesis is the generation of new blood vessels from existing ones, which is firmly managed by specific molecules that either stimulate (proangiogenic factors) or suppress (antiangiogenic factors) the process. However, solid tumors exhibit abnormal hyperactivity of angiogenesis due to hypoxia or a lack of oxygen. To conquer the lack of oxygen and nutrients after reaching a specific burden, almost all solid tumors eventually trigger angiogenesis. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF-A), created by tumor cells after identifying low oxygen levels, is one of the most essential mediators of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. VEGF-A expression may also be caused by non-hypoxia-mediated initiation, such as Ras signaling.",0
12,2,"VEGF-A, which is overexpressed in most solid tumor types, is a crucial player in tumor-induced angiogenesis. Its effect is mediated by its cognate receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, present in endothelial and bone marrow-derived cells. The VEGF pathway is a major target for blocking tumor angiogenesis, and several molecules that inhibit different components of this pathway have been developed in recent years. Examples include bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds and inactivates VEGF-A, and sunitinib, a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor that blocks phosphorylation of several tyrosine-kinase receptors including VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. These agents have already reached clinical practice.",0
12,3,"The VEGF-A gene has 8 exons, producing 5 main alternatively spliced isoforms (VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206), with the potential for longer isoforms. The importance of these isoforms is uncertain. Recently, a novel set of isoforms, referred to as ""b-isoforms"" or ""VEGFxxxb"" isoforms, have been identified. These isoforms code for polypeptides of equal length to classical isoforms, with exon 8 substituted by an alternatively spliced exon of the same size (exon 8b). Functionally, the ""b-isoforms"" may act as antagonists of VEGF-A receptors due to the substitution of exon 8, which is known to be important for receptor activation. Some reports suggest VEGF165b may have anti-angiogenic properties, while others suggest it may act as a VEGF-A receptor agonist.",0
12,4,"A potential variance in expression of ""angiogenic"" and ""antiangiogenic"" isoforms in diseases associated with abnormal vasculature development, such as cancer, is an intriguing topic. Prior investigations, using semi-quantitative RT-PCR techniques on a limited number of samples, have demonstrated significant expression of VEGFxxxb isoforms in regular prostate, colon, and kidney tissues when compared to their malignant counterparts. The theory suggests that neovascularization in pathological states would modify alternative splicing of VEGFA, causing an increase in the expression of ""b-isoforms"" (possessing anti-angiogenic potential) at the expense of the classical angiogenic isoform counterparts. A significant finding, as the VEGFxxxb/VEGF ratio expression may indicate the presence of angiogenic disease, making it an interesting area for further research.",0
12,5,"Given that the therapeutic application of recombinant VEGFxxxb proteins is attractive yet the biological activity of such transcripts remains unclear, the objective was to generate VEGF121b and VEGF165b proteins through Pichia pastoris yeast and develop expression vectors to overexpress these isoforms. This was done to better understand their function in cancer models. Furthermore, the study examined the protein expression of VEGFxxxb and overall VEGF in normal mammary glands as well as 50 breast cancer samples, utilizing previously characterized antibodies.",0
12,6,"Oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma-GenoSys (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). To clone the VEGF121b isoform, the VF (5'GAAACCATGAACTTTCTGCTGTCTT3') and V121bR (5' TTAAGCTTTCAGTCTTTCCTGGTGAGAGATTTTTCTTGTCTTGCTCTATC3') primers were used in PCR into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). Cloning of VEGF165b used VF and V165bR (5' TTAAGCTTTCAGTC-TTTCCTGGTGAGAGATCTGCAAGTACGTTCGTTTAACTC 3'). The initiation codon is underlined in VF, and both reverse oligonucleotides have HindIII restriction sites (bold). VEGF121b and VEGF165b coding sequences were subcloned into pCDNA3.1(-)Neo expression plasmid, followed by cloning of VEGF121b and VEGF165b coding sequences lacking the signal peptide (ΔPSVEGFxxxb) into the pPICZalphaC vector (Invitrogen) using the VPPF (5' GGTCTCGAGAAAAGAGAGGCTGAAGCTGCACCCATGGCAGAAGG 3') primer, together with V121bR or V165bR. These constructs were used to produce recombinant proteins in the yeast Pichia pastoris, where the alpha-factor signal peptide was used to achieve extracellular expression of the VEGFxxxb sequences.",0
12,7,"After linearizing and purifying the pPICZalphaC plasmids carrying the ΔPS-VEGFxxxb sequences, they were mixed with Pichia pastoris cells and electroporated in 1 mm-wide Bio-Rad electroporation cuvettes using preset yeast conditions. Following electroporation, the cells were transferred to sterile microtubes with 1 M sorbitol and incubated for 2 hours at 30°C. The zeocin-resistant colonies were grown in YPD medium and transferred to BMGY medium to grow for 30 hours at 29°C. The yeasts were then resuspended in BMMY medium to induce protein production.",0
12,8,"Supernatants obtained after 24 hours of incubation at 29°C were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to identify the best clone for each VEGF121/165b isoform. Selected clones were cultured in 2L of BMGY for 2 days and then transferred to BMMY medium for expression. Nickel-affinity chromatography was used for purification, with the Pichia pastoris supernatants containing recombinant VEGF121/165b proteins being diluted in binding buffer and loaded into an HPLC system containing a Hi-Trap chelating column connected to an AKTÄ HPLC device. Elution buffer containing increasing proportion of elution buffer was loaded and gradually mixed with binding buffer. Collections of 1mL fractions were generated throughout the process.",0
12,9,"The eluted proteins that were purified using affinity chromatography were removed from the eluting medium and converted to PBS through dialysis with the usage of Pierce's Slide-A-lyzer cassettes that had a 10 KDa threshold pore. The cassettes were filled with the eluted protein and placed in 3L of PBS solution for overnight. This process of changing to new PBS was continued for 6 more hours. Later, the dialyzed proteins were taken out from the cassettes using syringes and frozen quickly.",0
12,10,"Cultured cells were destroyed by RIPA buffer containing various ingredients including protease inhibitor cocktail. The protein concentration of samples was measured by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay. For conditioned culture media, supernatants were concentrated using 15-KDa Amicon Ultra centricons.",0
12,11,Proteins were subjected to electrophoresis in Bis-Tris buffered gels from Novex Gels (Invitrogen) under reducing or non-reducing conditions following standard protocols. A 20 μg protein solution (in RIPA buffer) was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer and heated for 5 minutes. Electrophoresis was conducted at room temperature for 90 minutes at 130V in 1X running buffer. Proteins in the gel were either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to PVDF membranes for immunodetection. VEGFxxxb proteins (90 μM) were deglycosylated and treated with 0.8 mM Endo F1 for 1 hour at 37°C. SDS-PAGE monitored the breakdown.,0
12,12,"The western blot membranes were washed twice with PBS-tween before being blocked using PBST plus 5% skim milk at room temperature for half an hour. Primary antibodies against various proteins, including VEGF, VEGFxxxb, pKDR, total KDR, pERK1/2, total ERK1/2, and GAPDH, were added and allowed to incubate. Horseradish peroxidase-labelled secondary antibodies were then used, and the chemoluminescent Lumi-lightPLUS kit from Roche was applied to visualize the immunoreactive bands.",0
12,13,"HUVECs, PC3, and A549 cell lines were obtained from ATCC. PC3 and A549 cells were kept in complete medium, which consisted of RPMI-1640 growth medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. HUVECs were kept in EGM-MV2 medium containing human recombinant EGF, VEGF, FGF, IGF-1, hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and 2% FBS. To analyze cell supernatants by western blot, the cell culture medium with 1% serum was used.",0
12,14,"The method used to introduce purified plasmidic DNA into mammalian cells was cationic lipid-based transfection with Lipofectamine 2000, following the manufacturer's guidelines. Transfected cells were maintained with complete medium plus either 300 μg/mL (PC3) or 500 μg/mL (A549) G418 after selection.",0
12,15,"The MTT assay and VEGF-related inhibitors were used to evaluate cell proliferation. Cells were initially seeded in 96-well plates containing 2% FBS growth medium and assessed following overnight incubation. Various compounds, including recombinant human VEGF165, VEGF 121 b, VEGF 165b, and the VEGFR inhibitor GW654652 were added to the culture plates. An MTT solution was added to each well at each time point, and the plates were incubated for an additional 3 hours before absorbance was measured at 550 nm using a microplate reader. Control wells containing only complete medium were also included. Each experiment consisted of three trials, with six replicates per drug concentration. The experiments were carried out using different VEGF- and VEGFR-related inhibitors to evaluate their impact on cell proliferation.",0
12,16,"The second technique involved assessing DNA synthesis by adding a modified nucleotide called EdU, followed by the Click-it reaction using Invitrogen's guidelines. At 50% confluence, cells were treated with either 50 or 100 ng/mL of rhVEGF 165, VEGF 121 b(pp), VEGF 165 b(pp), or bFGF overnight. Following that, cells were treated for 1 hour with a 5mM EdU solution, washed, trypsinized, fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with Alexa-Fluor-647 dye in the presence of copper for catalysis of the Click-it reaction. EdU incorporation was assessed by analyzing the cells with a FACScalibur flow cytometer.",0
12,17,"Nu/Nu mice with a Balb/C genetic background that were specifically bred to have no thymus were purchased from Harlan Laboratories in Barcelona, Spain. These mice were kept under Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) conditions. In order to initiate tumor growth, either one million PC3 cells or five million A549 cells were used. These cells, along with their corresponding transfectants, were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of Nu/Nu mice that were in their exponential growth phase. Precision callipers were used to measure tumor growth, and in order to ensure that tumors did not exceed 1.7cm in diameter, the mice were sacrificed. The experiments were conducted according to the guidelines for ethical use of animals of their Institution (CIMA-University of Navarra), which were approved beforehand. The harvested tumors were fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned for analysis. The primary tumor volumes were calculated using the formula: V = length × (width)^2/2.",0
12,18,"For conducting Matrigel plug assays, a mixture of 400 μL Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel (BD) and either 100 ng of rhVEGF165, VEGF121b(pp), VEGF165b(pp), or bFGF (as positive control) in 100 μL PBS was injected subcutaneously in Nu/Nu mice. After one week of cell inoculation, the mice were retro-orbitally injected with either 100 mL Fluorescein-labelled dextran (3 mg/mL) or with Alexa-647labelled isolectin B4 (100 μg/mL). After a 15-minute wait period, the mice were sacrificed, and the Matrigel plugs were taken out and examined under a Zeiss Axiovert confocal microscope.",0
12,19,"Tissues from in vivo experiments, either xenografted tumors or matrigel plugs, were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. AccuMax (Seoul, Korea; catalogue # A202(I)) provided the Tissue Microarray (TMA) slides which contain 100 breast tissue cores from 50 patients and 8 tissue cores from 4 normal breast tissue obtained by mammoplasty. The TMA consists of 33 infiltrating ductal carcinomas, 7 papillary carcinomas, 3 phyllodes tumors, 4 infiltrating lobular carcinomas, and 3 samples corresponding to other breast cancer tumor types.",0
12,20,"To prepare for immunohistochemistry, the slides were first deparaffinized and hydrated. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% H2O2 in water for 10 minutes. An antigen retrieval method was used to detect the antibodies. Different primary antibodies were used at various dilutions: Caspase 3 (Cleaved Caspase-3 Asp 175, Cell Signaling) at 1:200, CD-31 (Dianova) at 1:20, PDGFRb (Cell Signaling) at 1:100, VEGF (Santa Cruz) at 1:200, and VEGFxxxb (R&D) at 1:50. The primary antibodies were incubated at 4°C overnight except for CD31, which was incubated for 1 hour at RT. Tissues were washed with TBS and then incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies. The EnVision™ antirabbit detection system (Dako) was used for each slide, followed by peroxidase activity with DAB (Dako). The slides were then counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. To quantify the images, 10 random images (200×) per mouse were captured with a microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with the Analysis™ software. Positive cells were then quantified with Image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).",0
12,21,"For the quantification of FITC-dextran and Alexa-647 Isolectin B4 in Matrigel plug sections, we used an Axiovert epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) to analyze slides, capturing 10 random pictures of each Matrigel. The labelled area was then measured using the ImageJ software.",0
12,22,"The normal distribution of the data sets was assessed using Shapiro-Wilks and Kolgomorov-Smirnoff tests, and homogeneity of variances was verified using Levene's test. ANOVA was used to test for differences among groups for normally distributed data sets, while non-parametric tests such as Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney's U-test were used for non-normal distributed data sets. Bonferroni correction was used for post-hoc comparisons in the case of variance homogeneity, while Tamhane's correction was applied when Levene's test was positive. Wilcoxon's test was used for dependent sample data. SPSS software was utilized to run these tests. Significance was determined by p-value, with results having a p-value < 0.05 considered significant (*), those with a p-value < 0.01 (**), very significant, and those with a p-value <0.001 (***), extremely significant.",0
12,23,"A schematic in Figure 1 illustrates the various exons present in both the “classical” VEGF-A isoforms and “VEGFxxxb” isoforms. The coding sequence for VEGF121b and VEGF165b, devoid of their native human signal peptide, was inserted into the pPICZalphaC plasmid. The yeast alpha-factor signal peptide was used in place of the native human signal peptide for these constructs, as it is an efficient secretion inducer in Pichia pastoris. To ensure high-quality recombinant proteins, nickel-affinity chromatography was utilized to isolate VEGFxxxb from Pichia pastoris culture supernatants, as illustrated by the chromatogram in Figure 2A. VEGF121b was eluted using a 20% imidazole gradient. The bands, depicted in Figure 2B, corresponding to the anticipated size of VEGF121b were stained using Coomassie blue and were identified around peak 2. These observations indicate the effectiveness of nickel-affinity chromatography to extract VEGFxxxb proteins from Pichia pastoris culture supernatants.",0
12,24,"Figure 2C displays the electrophoresed culture media from Pichia pastoris clones that were electroporated with the linearized VEGF 121b or VEGF 165b sequence-containing pPICZaphaC plasmids and selected with zeocin for one week. The bands of predicted molecular masses were detected in the clones' supernatants. Pichia pastoris exposed clearly visible ectopic protein amounts among the total secreted proteins. The clones that overexpressed higher recombinant VEGFxxxb proteins were chosen for large-scale production. Crucially, the Pichia pastoris-derived recombinant proteins reacted positively to the commercially available (and previously validated) VEGFxxxb antibody from R&D (Figure 2D).",0
12,25,"The recombinant human VEGF121/165b isoforms expressed in Pichia pastoris had a band pattern similar to that of the native VEGFxxx isoforms, which has been previously described. Under non-reducing conditions, VEGF121b forms dimers that can be detected in the gel as three bands. These three bands most likely correspond to dimers of glycosylated-glycosylated, glycosylated-non-glycosylated and non-glycosylated-non-glycosylated proteins, which is consistent with the VEGF-A classic isoforms. When the same culture supernatants were run under reducing conditions, only two bands were visible, indicating the ability of these proteins to dimerize. The same pattern was seen for VEGF165b, although the bands were not as clear as for VEGF121b. Recombinant VEGFxxxb proteins also formed larger complexes, including tetramers and octamers, particularly for VEGF165b.",0
12,26,"The glycosylation status of the VEGFxxxb recombinant proteins produced in Picha pastoris was assessed using endoglycosidase F1 in both reducing and non-reducing conditions. Additional file 1 Figure S1 was referred to for this purpose. The deglycosylation of VEGF121/165 b resulted in an electrophoretic shift for both isoforms. The observed molecular weights for the glycosylated and deglycosylated proteins were in line with those of VEGF121 and VEGF165, as reported in references [20, 21].",0
12,27,"The laboratory-produced VEGF121b(pp) and VEGF165b(pp) recombinant proteins were initially tested on endothelial cell proliferation in vitro, as well as a VEGF165b recombinant protein (VEGF165b(hs)) produced in mammalian CHO cells to eliminate any potential yeast-glycosylation-derived effect. The MTT assay was used in a first experiment, and it was found that exposing HUVECs to commercial VEGF165 (from R&D) at a dose of 100 ng/mL caused a 63% increase in proliferation compared to untreated cells. Similar proliferative induction was observed when co-administering VEGF165 with either VEGF121b(pp), VEGF165b(pp), or VEGF165b(hs) at the same dose. Each of the recombinant ""b-isoforms"" alone resulted in around a 40% increase in proliferation. Administering the VEGFR-targeting compound GW654652 alone or with VEGF165b(hs) led to rates of HUVEC proliferation similar to that of untreated control cells, which demonstrated the specificity of VEGF165b in inducing VEGFR-mediated endothelial proliferation. Comparable results using the VEGFR inhibitor were obtained for VEGF121b(pp) and VEGF165b(pp) (results not shown).",0
12,28,"The team utilized a separate technique to verify their results on cell proliferation by tracking DNA incorporation into cells. Their findings, presented in Figure 3B, indicated that the administration of bFGF and VEGF 165 caused a threefold increase (p < 0.001) in DNA incorporation into HUVECs compared to untreated controls. Additionally, exposure to VEGF165b(pp) and VEGF121b(pp) resulted in a nearly twofold increase (p < 0.01) in DNA incorporation into HUVECs. The results obtained from this method mirror those obtained with MTT testing, which demonstrated that the VEGFxxxb variants induce cell proliferation, albeit with less potency than VEGF165.",0
12,29,"The addition of all VEGF-A proteins to HUVECs resulted in the phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR (also known as VEGFR2) and the intracellular kinase ERK1/2. VEGF165 was expected to cause the phosphorylation of KDR and ERK1/2, which it did within 10 minutes of treatment in serum-free conditions. VEGF121/165b proteins were also found to induce KDR phosphorylation in HUVECs. Both VEGF121b and VEGF165b, produced in mammalian cells or in Pichia pastoris, stimulated similar levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Co-administration of VEGF165 and VEGF121/165b did not prevent VEGF165-induced KDR or ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The specific receptor inhibitor, GW654652, prevented the activation of the KDR-ERK pathway by VEGF165b(pp), VEGF 121 b(pp), and VEGF165b(hs). The results obtained were similar across all proteins tested, apart from VEGF165b (hs), which was not shown.",0
12,30,"Matrigel plug assays were utilized to investigate the influence of VEGF121/165b isoforms on endothelial cell function in vivo. The Matrigel was mixed with bFGF, VEGF165 (from R&D), VEGF121b(pp), or VEGF165b(pp). The identification of blood vessels within the Matrigel plugs was accomplished by administering systemically an Alexa-647-labelled isolectin B4 (Figure 5A) before the sacrifice. In contrast, no signal from the Alexa-647-labelled lectin was seen in the Matrigel controls, while plugs that carried any VEGFxxxb isoforms displayed a strong signal attesting to angiogenesis in vivo (Figure 5A). To scrutinize vascular permeability, FITC-labelled-dextran was injected under similar experimental conditions into another group of mice with Matrigel plugs (Figure 5B). Significantly, the control plugs exhibited almost no fluorescent signal, whilst Matrigels pre-loaded with bFGF or especially with VEGF121b exhibited a significant increase in the fluorescent signal. The Matrigel plugs carrying either VEGF165 or VEGF165b showed similar fluorescence, which was about ten times higher than in the controls.",0
12,31,"The study selected two cell lines, one with high total VEGF expression (PC-3) and the other with low expression (A549) for in vivo assays. VEGF 121/165 b isoforms were overexpressed in both models to investigate their effects on tumor growth and angiogenesis. Western blot analyses confirmed high expression of either VEGF121b or VEGF165b in the selected cell pools. In PC3 xenografts, there were no statistical differences between control tumors and those overexpressing either or both isoforms, although VEGF121b-overexpressing cells tended to form bigger tumors. However, in A549 xenografts, both VEGF121b and VEGF165b overexpression led to significant increases in tumor volumes compared to controls. Thus, overexpression of VEGF121/165 b isoforms did not cause tumor shrinkage but instead led to tumor growth in these models.",0
12,32,"Angiogenesis analysis showed that A549 tumors were less angiogenic than PC-3 tumors, and there were no differences between controls and experimental groups. VEGF121b overexpressing tumors in PC-3 showed significantly higher vascularization than the other experimental groups. Analysis of PDGFRb levels by immunohistochemistry and image analysis did not reveal any decrease in PDGFRb+ cells in either PC-3 or A549 xenografted tumors. Apoptotic cells were also quantified, and no changes were observed in A549 xenografts. In PC-3 xenografted tumors, there was a reduction in the number of apoptotic cells when VEGFxxxboverexpressing cells were injected compared to controls.",0
12,33,"Previous research has indicated that VEGFxxxb isoforms may be expressed differently in normal versus pathological conditions. In order to investigate whether this was also true for breast cancer, a TMA containing core biopsies from both patients with breast cancer and normal breast tissue was utilized. In conducting this research, a thoroughly validated antibody that detects total VEGF-A (including all VEGF-A isoforms) was employed (R&D systems), as well as the sole verified anti-VEGFxxxb antibody that recognizes all VEGFxxxb proteins (also R&D systems) [18]. Currently, there is no antibody available that is specific to ""non-b"" isoforms (i.e. VEGFxxx).",0
12,34,"Representative images of malignant and normal breast tissues stained with the anti-VEGFxxxb and anti-total VEGF-A antibodies are shown in Figures 8A and 8B. The results show a strong staining for VEGFxxxb in tumor cells of infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) samples, as well as in other types of tumors, including papillary carcinoma (Pap), phyllodes (Phy), infiltrating lobular carcinomas (ILC), and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). However, no VEGFxxxb was detected in any of the normal breast tissue (NBT) samples. All tissues analyzed were positive for total-VEGF-A, including the normal breast epithelium. Semiquantification of the staining revealed that both total VEGF-A and VEGFxxxb protein levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in IDC than in normal breast tissues, as shown in Figures 8C and 8D. Additionally, a significant (p = 0.033) positive correlation index (r = 0.404) between VEGFxxxb and total-VEGF-A was observed, implying the degree of co-staining. Therefore, we conclude that VEGFxxxb levels are not reduced in malignant breast cancer but, on the contrary, tend to increase in the tumor samples and are significantly higher in infiltrating ductal carcinomas.",0
12,35,"The exploration and documentation of VEGF-A's importance in normal and pathological angiogenesis has been widespread in recent decades. VEGF-A has become a key focus for cancer therapy in solid tumors, and drugs targeted at VEGF, such as bevacizumab and sunitinib, are currently being utilized in patients. Nonetheless, the biology of VEGF-A spliced isoforms remains poorly understood. Specifically, comprehending how the various VEGF-A isoforms are generated through alternative splicing may be significant in developing more targeted and effective molecular therapies.",0
12,36,"In 2002, researchers discovered a new family of VEGF-A isoforms through alternative splicing that were named VEGFxxxb isoforms. These isoforms incorporate a different exon, exon 8b, than the classical exon 8a found in angiogenic transcripts. The inclusion of exon 8b is believed to enable VEGFxxxb to bind VEGF-A receptors without causing strong downstream signalling activation, resulting in VEGFxxxb's hypothesized antiangiogenic properties. Notably, overexpressing VEGF 165 b or VEGF 121 b in tumor cells transplanted into nude mice was found to inhibit growth. Furthermore, VEGFxxxb isoforms may be differentially expressed in pathological tissues compared to normal tissues, potentially aggravating aberrant angiogenesis-linked disease by reducing the amount of VEGFxxxb isoforms expressed in normal tissues.",0
12,37,"The present study aimed to create VEGF 121 b and VEGF165b recombinant proteins in Pichia pastoris yeast to test their antiangiogenic and antitumor properties in vitro and in vivo. The PCDNA3.1 plasmid was also utilized to generate cancer cells overexpressing VEGF121/165b. The yeast expression system was selected due to its ability to glycosylate proteins and purify them without contamination from endogenous proteins. Additionally, it is faster, easier, and more cost-effective compared to mammalian systems. Moreover, yeasts do not code for any form of VEGF, eliminating the possibility of exon 8-containing VEGF-A contamination and exons 8 and 8b heterodimer formation.",0
12,38,"Recombinant VEGF121b and VEGF165b proteins, similar in structure to classical VEGF121 and VEGF165, were successfully produced with the capacity to form dimers/multimers and react with commercial antibodies formulated against exons 1 to 5, common to all VEGF-A isoforms. Moreover, both recombinant proteins showed immunoreactivity with a validated antibody recognizing exon 8b from R&D [18].",0
12,39,"To evaluate the performance of these isoforms in vitro, HUVECs were treated with recombinant proteins generated in yeasts, VEGF 165 b created in mammalian cells, or the “classical” VEGF165 angiogenic protein (as a control). All the treatments were conducted in serum-free media. We observed that VEGF121/165b isoforms induced HUVECs' proliferation and phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and its downstream transducer ERK. However, the effect of VEGF121/165b isoforms was less potent than that of VEGF165: Proliferation of HUVECs was stimulated with VEGF121/165 b isoforms by approximately 50% less than recombinant VEGF165. Nevertheless, the degree of ERK activation was similar for all tested proteins, 10 minutes after stimulation. This intracellular mediator was phosphorylated particularly by VEGFRs, as proved by the restriction of this process in the presence of the VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 tyrosine-kinase inhibitor GW654652.",0
12,40,"VEGF165b has distinct functional properties compared to other VEGF isoforms. Kawamura et al. [16] found that VEGF165b is a weaker agonist of VEGFR2 compared to VEGF145, but can still induce phosphorylation of VEGFR2 in HUVECs. VEGF165b, like VEGF121, does not bind to neuropilin-1 (NRP1) or induce complexes between NRP1 and VEGFR2. It promotes cell migration, but does not induce endothelial sprout formation. Interestingly, VEGF165b cannot phosphorylate VEGFR2 at Y1052 and may block transphosphorylation by preventing full rotation of the receptor's intracellular tail upon binding. Additionally, Glass et al. [17] have shown that VEGF165b transiently activates VEGFR1 to increase vascular permeability. Taken together, these findings suggest that VEGF165b may have weaker downstream signaling effects in endothelial cells.",0
12,41,"To confirm the angiogenic properties of VEGF 121/165b observed in traditional laboratory tests, we conducted experiments in vivo using Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel. This substance has significantly reduced levels of angiogenic cytokines such as VEGF. When we added recombinant VEGF 121 b, VEGF 165 b, or VEGF 165 to the Matrigel, we noticed the recruitment of blood vessels compared to the control group loaded with PBS. These findings indicate an angiogenic effect. We must note that Matrigels containing VEGF121b had high levels of dextran-FITC signal both inside and outside of the vessels (similar to bFGF results). This indicates an increase in vascular permeability, which matches the vascular permeability described for VEGF121 [27].",0
12,42,"During our study, we conducted tests to determine if VEGF121/165b overexpression in xenograft models could inhibit tumor growth in vivo. To do this, we chose two different cancer cell lines: The low-VEGF-expressing lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line and the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line, which secretes a higher amount of VEGF. Our goal was to investigate any potential differences in VEGFxxxb behavior based on the endogenous VEGF expression. These tests were conducted without the use of any additional exogenous VEGF stimulation, such as transfection of VEGF. In PC3 xenografts, there were no statistical differences between the control group and VEGF121/165b-expressing tumors. However, we did observe a tendency for VEGF121boverexpressing tumors to grow at a faster rate than the other groups. Vascular density was significantly higher in the VEGF121 b-overexpressing PC-3 tumors than in the other groups, and apoptotic levels were significantly lower. As previously described, A549 xenografts grew slowly and formed small tumors after subcutaneous implantation in nude mice.",0
12,43,"The findings presented here contradict previous research indicating that VEGF 165 b has anti-tumor properties. However, it is suggested that this discrepancy may be due to the levels of VEGF expression in the in vivo models studied. When VEGF levels are high, VEGFxxxb and VEGFxxx compete equally for receptor binding, leading to reduced tumor growth when VEGFxxxb is overexpressed. However, when VEGF expression is low, overexpression of VEGFxxxb may actually stimulate tumor growth to some degree. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that no difference in tumor growth was detected between parental and VEGF165b-overexpressing CAKI cells when VEGF levels were around 900 pg/mL.",0
12,44,"It is plausible that VEGFxxxb protein therapies could be effective in tumors with high levels of endogenous VEGF. However, using this therapy in tumors with low VEGF levels that rely on other angiogenic factors (such as bFGF, IL-8, etc.) for growth could potentially worsen the tumor's progression. Hence, administering VEGFxxxb protein as a therapy raises doubts about its use in unselected patients. It is critical to exercise caution and stratify patients based on their VEGF production levels to identify those who can benefit from VEGFxxxb-based therapies. Future clinical trials need to consider this aspect.",0
12,45,"There are still many unknowns regarding the biology of VEGFxxxb and before proceeding with therapy translation, these aspects need to be clarified. One surprising finding is that VEGF121b, which was discovered to inhibit endothelial cell migration, actually provided cytoprotection for endothelial cells in serum starvation experiments in a similar way to VEGF165 by activating VEGF receptors and downstream signalling. Another unexpected result is that in some xenograft models, co-overexpression of VEGF165 and VEGF165b actually results in smaller tumors than overexpression of just VEGF165b. There are also other key questions to answer, such as whether VEGFxxxb proteins can heterodimerize with members of the VEGFxxx angiogenic family.",0
12,46,"In this study, we investigated whether VEGFxxxb isoforms are expressed differently in malignant (human breast cancer) and healthy tissues (normal mammary gland). Using validated antibodies specific for VEGFxxxb isoforms and transcripts, we performed immunohistochemistry experiments. Our findings showed that both total VEGF and VEGFxxxb levels tended to increase in breast cancer tissues (n = 50) compared to normal tissues (n = 8). We observed statistically significant increases in intraductal carcinomas (IDC). Additionally, there was a significant correlation between the expression of total VEGF and VEGFxxxb, suggesting that both families of VEGF follow a similar pattern of expression.",0
12,47,"Previous investigations have examined the expression of the VEGFxxxb isoforms in a restricted number of samples. Although the total VEGF mRNA levels in colon carcinoma samples (n=6) were significantly elevated compared to controls, VEGFxxxb mRNA levels remained unchanged [18]. This suggests that the rise in total VEGF is attributed to the VEGFxxx angiogenic isoforms [18]. By analyzing protein levels with isoform-specific ELISAs, a similar result was obtained [18]. VEGF165b was discovered to be present in 17 of 18 normal kidney samples but only in 4 of 18 paired malignant tissues, as indicated by RT-PCR analysis [19]. The immunohistochemical analysis of 19 melanoma samples (9 metastatic and 10 non-metastatic) using the VEGFxxxb-specific antibody discovered a decrease in VEGFxxxb expression in neoplastic tissue (particularly in metastasis) relative to normal skin [25].",0
12,48,"The characterization of the expression pattern of VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb proteins in normal and malignant tissues is impeded due to the absence of suitable antibodies. To evaluate if VEGFxxxb expression can be used as a cancer biomarker, future studies using a larger sample size, along with quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses, would be required.",0
12,49,"The findings indicate that VEGF121/165b are not antiangiogenic; rather, they are slightly pro-angiogenic forms of VEGF-A that could facilitate the development of tumors and angiogenesis in vivo. Additionally, it was discovered that VEGFxxxb isoforms, along with overall VEGF concentrations, are elevated in breast cancer compared to non-cancerous breast tissue.",0
13,1,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a disease caused by a highly virulent strain of coronavirus [1]. Unlike other coronaviruses that cause only mild illness, this strain of the virus, called SARS-CoV, has a high mortality rate. Because strains of the virus exist in animal reservoirs, there is a risk of SARS re-emerging. Therefore, developing safe and effective vaccines is a high priority. The genome of SARS-CoV is made up of single-stranded RNA and codes for four main structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [2]. The S protein plays a critical role in both recognising and attaching to receptors on target cells, allowing the virus to enter and infect them [3].",0
13,2,"In the pursuit of developing vaccines for different pathogens, DNA vaccines have been extensively researched. These vaccines can trigger both humoral and cellular immune responses, as per numerous studies [4]. Several studies have also shown that DNA-based vaccines can produce a protective immune response to various viruses [5,6], but their incapability to induce immune response in mice when administered through the intranasal (i.n.) route [7] remains an issue. Given that most respiratory infections enter through the mucosal surface, it is imperative that a vaccine can induce both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Mucosal immune responses are crucial as a frontline immune defense in combating an influenza virus infection, and parenteral immunization alone does not suffice to trigger protective immunity [9]. Secretory IgA plays a vital role in facilitating mucosal immunity [8].",0
13,3,"Polyethylenimine (PEI) has been widely used as a nonviral vector both in vitro and in vivo because of its high transfection efficiency and buffering capacity. Recent studies have revealed that mucosal administration with PEI can serve as a potent mucosal immunostimulator, while also being an effective gene delivery vehicle for lung transfection, producing high antibody titers against encoded proteins. In the present study, the researchers examined the immune responses of BALB/c mice immunized with the SARS DNA vaccine via the intranasal route.",0
13,4,"'The ability of a gene carrier to condense DNA into nano-sized particles is widely acknowledged to influence its transfection efficiency [13]. As anticipated, PEI successfully condensed the DNA into such particles, which indicates their potential for endocytosis (as shown in Figure 1A).'",0
13,5,"The spherical shape and size of the PEI/pci-S nanoparticles were observed and confirmed through energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) and dynamic light scattering, respectively. The cell viability of RAW 264.7 cells decreased slightly with increasing N/P ratio of PEI/pci-S complexes. Rhodamine labeled pci-S DNA was utilized to visualize the uptake of the complex by the cells, and RT-PCR analysis revealed that both pci-SDNA and PEI/pci-S nanoparticles can transfect the cells, with the latter inducing stronger S mRNA expression than naked DNA.",0
13,6,"To assess the impact of PEI on adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV S protein, mice were given SARS-CoV DNA vaccine intranasally and specific antibody responses were observed. High levels of SARS-CoV S-specific serum IgG antibody were produced in mice immunized with PEI/pci-S complexes, whereas mice immunized with SARS-CoV S DNA alone did not produce similar results. To determine the balance of Th1/Th2 response, SARS S-specific IgG1 and IgG2 levels were examined, with SARS S-specific IgG1 antibody greatly increasing in mice given the SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine with PEI, suggesting a Th2 dominant response. Mucosal antibody production was analyzed as well, with SARS S-specific IgA antibody response increasing notably in lung wash from mice given PEI/pci-S complexes.",0
13,7,The proliferation ability of B220+ cells was measured to evaluate B lymphocyte response to SARSCoV spike protein. It was further confirmed that antibody responses were enhanced at 1 week after the last vaccination. B220+ cells from mice immunized with PEI/pci-S complexes were found to have a high level of proliferation after being re-stimulated with SARS-CoV S protein in vitro (Figure 2C).,0
13,8,"The expression of markers on the surface of DCs increases during their maturation, including molecules for co-stimulation and MHC class. In order to investigate the impacts of DNA vaccination on DC maturation, mice were given PEI/pci-S complexes through intranasal immunization. The DCs of the mice who received the PEI/pci-S complexes showed significantly higher levels of CD80 and CD86 co-stimulatory molecules on their surfaces compared to those who were only given the SARS-CoV DNA S vaccine. This was also true for MHC class II, I-Ad, expression, which was significantly up-regulated in the group who received the PEI/pci-S complexes compared to those who only received the SARS-CoV DNA vaccine. (Figure 3).",0
13,9,"Cytokine profiles were analyzed using intracellular cytokine assays to investigate T cell immunity to the SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine. Lung cells obtained 6 days post-immunization were used for the study. Prior research has indicated that T cells that produce IFN-g, IL-2, IL-17, and TNF-a provide effective protection. The number of IFN-g-producing cells increased in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in mice vaccinated with PEI/pci-S, while the number of IL-17-producing cells increased only in CD4+ T cells. However, CD8+ T cells from mice vaccinated with PEI/pci-S did not produce IFN-g, IL-2 or IL-17. After restimulation, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from mice vaccinated with PEI/pci-S produced TNF-a and TNF-a and IL-2 in larger amounts. Additionally, IFN-g and IL-17 were found to be produced together more frequently in the PEI/pci-S group than in the pci-S group. Notably, no IL4-producing cells were detected in the lung or spleen.",0
13,10,"In the 21st century, an emerging infectious disease known as SARS posed a significant threat to public health and the global economy [1]. The virus infected over 8,000 individuals in 26 countries, resulting in 774 fatalities [15]. Research revealed that the SARS-CoV spike protein (S) played a crucial role in virus entry, attachment, and receptor recognition [16], which made it a prime target for vaccine development [6]. To prevent SARS outbreaks, numerous vaccine studies focused on the S protein, including fragment DNA, full-length DNA, and receptor binding domain vaccines [17]. Studies showed that a DNA vaccine encoding the full-length S protein produced humoral, cellular, and protective immune responses against SARS-CoV [6]. This study explored the immunogenicity of intranasal immunization in mice using PEI/pci-S.",0
13,11,"The enhancement of transfection efficiency and immunogenicity in mammalian cells has been linked to PEI/DNA complexes according to previous reports. This study aims to use the PEI/pci-S complex in mucosal DNA vaccination. The complexes were found to be approximately 200 nm in size. The impact of these complexes on transfection, gene, and protein expression was tested on RAW 264.7 cells by measuring mRNA and protein expression. Based on these results, the study moved forward to in vivo trials for mouse immunization through intranasal administration of PEI/pci-S complexes.",0
13,12,"Several studies have attempted to create SARS DNA vaccines using systemic routes, such as intramuscular injection. However, targeting intranasal immunization may be more effective, as SARS is a respiratory pathogen. In particular, using PEI/pci-S complexes for intranasal immunization induced stronger antigen-specific serum IgG responses than using just pci-S. This method also increased antigen-specific IgG1 and IgA responses, suggesting a Th2 dominant response. Additionally, B cell proliferation was enhanced after in vitro re-stimulation with the spike protein. Garzon's study found that antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses increased in mice immunized with DNA vaccine up to 100 μg, but in this study, each mouse was only given 20 μg of DNA, which was still able to induce both systemic and mucosal immune responses.",0
13,13,"Dendritic cells (DCs) have a crucial function in effectively triggering immune responses specific to antigens. DCs are present throughout the body and act as the first line of defense against pathogens [21]. When DCs encounter pathogen-associated molecular patterns from microorganisms, they become mature and acquire the capacity for antigen presentation, leading to increased expression of MHC proteins [22], cytokines [23], and a higher number of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD83, and CD86 [24]. Therefore, DC maturation is critical for initiating appropriate subsequent adaptive immune responses [22]. The present study confirms that PEI/pci-S complexes stimulate co-stimulatory and MHC class II molecules on DCs in cervical lymph nodes following intranasal immunization.",0
13,14,"The immune responses of cells are controlled by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Studies show that these antigen-specific T cells produce cytokines, such as IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-2, and IL-17, after re-stimulation with SARS spike peptides. IFN-g activates macrophages and DCs while inhibiting viral infections; TNF-a inhibits viral replication and regulates immune cells; IL-2 maintains memory T cells and expands T cells, while IL-17 causes the production of antimicrobial peptides and immunoglobulin to neutralize viral infections. It has also been found that antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secrete IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-2, and IL-17 in nonlymphoid tissues like the lung. Multiple cytokine-producing cells also increase when mice are immunized with PEI/pci-S. These cells are believed to be responsible for protection if the host becomes infected with SARS-CoV after vaccination. Multi-cytokine producing antigen-specific CD4+ T cells are more effective in protection than single-cytokine producing cells. Studies have shown that multi-cytokine producing T cells have excellent results against the infection of Leishmania major.",0
13,15,"PEI has been shown to be successful in transporting DNA to the mucosal surface, promoting dendritic cell maturation, and enhancing the immune response to DNA vaccines. Our findings suggest that PEI could serve as an effective vehicle for mucosal administration of DNA vaccines and contribute significantly to both B cell and T cell immunity.",0
13,16,"The SARS-CoV spike (S) protein gene lacking the transmembrane domain (amino acids 14-1154) was artificially constructed. The gene sequence was optimized for expression in mammalian cells and the natural signal sequence was replaced with the leader sequence of human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Subsequently, using Nhe I and Not I, tPA-S gene and pci-neo were cleaved and then joined together to generate a plasmid expressing SARS-CoV S protein.",0
13,17,"PEI/pci-S nanoparticles were created by combining polymer and pci-S DNA in a solution with an N/P ratio of 10. The size of the nanoparticles was determined using an electrophoretic light scattering spectrophotometer (ELS8000, Otsuka Electronics, Osaka, Japan), while their morphology was observed via EF-TEM (LIBRA 120, Carl Zeiss, Germany).",0
13,18,"The pci-S DNA was labeled with rhodamine using the Label IT® Tracker™ CX-Rhodamine kit from Mirus, WI for cell uptake observation. RAW 264.7 cells were seeded and the PEI/Rhodamine-labeled pci-S DNA nanoparticles were incubated for an hour and then washed. ProLong® Gold antifade reagent with DAPI from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA was used to mount them. Confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss-LSM510, Thornwood, NY) was employed to observe the cell uptake images.",0
13,19,The researchers analyzed the expression of SARS-CoV S in RAW 264.7 cells using both transcriptional and protein level methods. The cells were transfected with naked pci-S DNA or PEI/pciS nanoparticles at an N/P ratio of 10 and the resulting cells were lysed with either Trizol or cell lysis buffer. Reverse transcription was performed with Superscript III reverse transcriptase and the cDNA was amplified by PCR with primers for pci-S and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The amplification products were analyzed by electrophoresis.,0
13,20,"Equal amounts of lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NY) for the Western blot assay. The membranes were blocked using 5% non-fat milk, and then the spike protein primary antibody, obtained from Chiron, and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were successively incubated with the membrane. Detection of the antigen-antibody interaction was performed using an ECL fluorescence system. For control purposes, b-actin was used.",0
13,21,"Female BALB/c mice (Orient, Korea) aged six to eight weeks were given anesthesia before immunization. Each group consisted of five mice who were given 20 μg of pci-mock, pci-S, or PEI/pci-S complexes in a total of 25 μl ultrapure water on days 0, 14, 28, and 42 i.n. The International Vaccine Institute (Seoul, Korea) approved all studies.",0
13,22,"Samples of Sera and mucosa were obtained approximately a week after the last immunization. Blood was gathered via the retro-orbital plexus. Fecal extracts were dissolved in a solution of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 0.02% sodium azide. For the remaining samples, the mice were anesthetized, and vaginal and nasal washes were harvested by pipetting with PBS. Additionally, lung washes were achieved by flushing and sampling the lungs with PBS.",0
13,23,"Microtiter plates from Nunc in Denmark were used to coat with 2 μg/ml of S protein from the Protein Sciences Corporation located in Meriden, CT. These plates were then blocked with 5% skim milk before diluting serum (1:20) or mucosal samples (1:2), with the exception of lung wash which required no dilution, in the blocking buffer. Goat-anti mouse IgG, IgG1, IgG2a or IgA conjugated with horseradish peroxidase from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc were added to each well in the blocking buffer followed by the application of 100 μl samples into separate wells. The color was developed using TMB solution from Sigma in the dark and the reaction was stopped by 0.5N HCl. Lastly, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured in a microplate reader from Molecular Devices Corp. in Menlo Park, CA.",0
13,24,Splenocytes from mice were collected after they had been vaccinated and labeled with CFSE. The cells were then stimulated with SARS-S protein for 5 days and B cells were identified using anti-B220-PerCP. The extent of cell proliferation was measured using FACSCalibur and FlowJo software was used to analyze the results.,0
13,25,"On day 3 after the final vaccination, the cervical lymph nodes (CLN) were eliminated. After creating a single cell suspension, CD11c-APC and CD80-PE, CD83-PE, CD86-biotin, or I-A d -biotin antibodies were used for staining (BD Biosciences). The expression level was assessed by flow cytometry utilizing the FACSCalibur. All cytometric data were calculated employing FlowJo software and were presented as MFI (mean fluorescence intensity).",0
13,26,"After taking out the lungs of mice six days after their final vaccination, the lungs were turned into single-cell suspensions. These cells were then placed onto a 96-well plate at a rate of 2 × 10^5 cells per well and stimulated again with SARS peptide from Peptron at a 5 μg/ml concentration for 12 hours. Following the manufacturer's directions, an intracellular cytokine staining assay was performed. The cells were next stained with different antibodies such as anti-CD4-PerCP and anti-CD8FITC alongside either anti-IFN-g-APC and -IL-17-PE, or anti-TNF-a-APC and -IL-2-PE (all from BD Biosciences). By employing flow cytometry - FACSCalibur, the percentage of cells with fluorescence was identified. Finally, using FlowJo software, all cytometric data was analyzed.",0
13,27,Statistical analysis was conducted using a Student's t-test and a significance level of less than 0.05 was deemed significant.,0
