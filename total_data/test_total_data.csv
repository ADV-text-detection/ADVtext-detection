14,2,"Trauma and stressor-related disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related comorbid disorders such as anxiety, depression, and dissociative disorders, are difficult to treat. Mindfulness-based clinical interventions have proven efficacy for mental health treatment in faceto-face individual and group modalities, although the feasibility and efficacy of delivering these interventions via the internet has not been evaluated. The present research developed mindfulness and metta-based trauma therapy (MMTT) as an internet resource to support the practice of mindfulness and metta (lovingkindness) meditations for self-regulation and healing from trauma and stressor-related disorders. In the present Bproof-of-concept^ study, research participants (n=177) recruited online practiced mindfulness and metta meditations and related therapeutic exercises available via the website and rated their perceived credibility as interventions for improving self-regulation and well-being and reducing PTSD symptoms, anxiety, depressive, and dissociative experiences, as well as their experienced ease, helpfulness, and informational value. Results suggest that, independent of level of self-reported current and past psychiatric history and PTSD symptoms, participants considered the MMTT website as a credible and helpful therapeutic intervention for improving self-regulation and wellbeing and reducing PTSD, anxiety, depression, and dissociation.",1
14,3,"Clinicians and researchers have described a number of ways by which mindfulness-based therapies may exert therapeutic benefits for people with PTSD (Lang et al. 2012; Thompson et al. 2011). These include (1) improving attention and concentration; (2) improving participants’ abilities to focus on the present and away from traumatic memories and other sources of rumination and anxiety; (3) altering of cognitive style (e.g., becoming less judgmental and more compassionate toward oneself and others); (4) lowering psychophysiological arousal; and (5) lowering of anhedonia and emotional numbing. A similar set of potential therapeutic benefits of mindfulness-based therapies for persons with traumarelated dissociative disorders was articulated by Zerubavel and Messman-Moore (2015). However, despite a sound treatment rationale, relatively few studies have examined the efficacy of mindfulness-based treatments for PTSD to date. Moreover, most published studies are limited by small sample sizes, inclusion of traumatized persons both with and without PTSD, and only pre-post (non-randomized) or wait-list control (rather than active control) designs. Acknowledging these limitations, research accumulated to date generally provides support for mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR, Kabat-Zinn 1990) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT, Segal et al. 2002) as interventions for persons with PTSD or PTSD-related symptoms either in combat veterans (Kearney et al. 2012; King et al. 2013; Niles et al. 2012) or women with histories of childhood abuse (Goldsmith et al. 2014; Kimbrough et al. 2010) or intimate partner violence (Bermudez et al. 2013; Dutton et al. 2013).",1
15,1,"In addition to examining mindfulness- and metta-based therapies for PTSD, researchers are examining the efficacy of non-traditional modalities for provision of treatment including internet-based treatment. An advantage of internet therapy is that it requires few clinical resources, with some evaluated programs being entirely automated and others entailing at most only a small number of face-to-face, telephone, or email communications per participant. Moreover, the ability for clinician-to-participant dyadic communication to be completed, if at all, solely through indirect methods can eliminate certain barriers that may otherwise prevent or discourage persons from receiving treatment where indicated, for example, due to social stigma associated with receiving mental health care, time and place accessibility, the financial cost of treatment, and the paucity of appropriately trained mental health professionals to deliver evidence-based treatment (see Boasso et al. 2014, for review). To date, psychological treatments for trauma and stressor-related disorders delivered via the internet generally involve exercises derived from cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), including narrative exposure therapy (structured writing about one’s traumatic experiences) and certain forms of relaxation training.",1
15,2,"Previous studies have found internet service delivery of CBT for PTSD to be both highly acceptable and effective. In fact, research shows that PTSD outcomes for online treatment are often of a comparable magnitude to those found for the same kinds of interventions when delivered face to face, as has been generally found for internet therapy of other affective disorders (Andersson and Cuijpers 2009; Cowpertwait and Clarke 2013; Cuijpers et al. 2011; Spek et al. 2007). Indeed, the first study of internet treatment of PTSD was completed more than a decade ago and demonstrated, among 20 college students previously exposed to interpersonal violence, that providing CBT interventions for emotion regulation in addition to exposure-based narrative writing about traumatic events conducted via email resulted in clinically significant reductions in posttreatment PTSD symptoms (Lange et al. 2000). Since that time, research has suggested that individuals are indeed interested to receive internet-based treatments of PTSD (e.g., Spence et. al., 2011), and a number of additional studies have provided general support for internet CBT interventions for PTSD, although most studies have only compared outcomes via pre-post or non-active control designs (e.g., with supportive counseling; see Boasso et al. 2014, for review). However, we are aware of no internet-based mindfulness or metta interventions for PTSD and related comorbid disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, or dissociative disorders.",1
15,3,"In an effort to increase the availability of mindfulness- and metta-based interventions to persons with trauma and stressorrelated disorders, we therefore developed a self-help internet resource we titled mindfulness and metta-based trauma therapy (MMTT). MMTT is intentioned primarily as a set of selfregulatory practices aimed toward augmenting outcomes associated with existing evidence-based treatments. The present report describes our initial development and Bproof-ofconcept^ evaluation of the MMTT internet resource in the form of assessing participants’ immediate experiences in response to completing the therapeutic exercises contained therein, that is, upon their first visit to the website. Participants were recruited via the internet and varied with respect to the presence or absence of diagnosed history of psychological disorders and self-reported PTSD. A more detailed description of the MMTT website content is given within the methods section. Our research aims were to evaluate the perceived credibility of the website content and interventions, broadly for improving self-regulation and well-being, as well as more specifically for treating PTSD and related comorbid symptoms of anxiety, depression, and dissociation",1
15,6,"The 20-item PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL5; Weathers et al. 2013) was administered. The PCL-5 is a measure of self-reported DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, with responses given on a frequency scale between BNot at all^ (scored 0) and BExtremely^(scored 4). The DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis includes 20 symptoms, hence the 20 PCL-5 items (i.e., the PCL-5 has a symptom to test-item ratio of 1:1). Total scores on the PCL-5 were calculated as the sum of scores for all 20 items, with a score of 38 recommended as a cut-off for probable PTSD (Hoge et al. 2014; Weathers et al. 2013). The internal consistency reliability observed in the present study was excellent (α=0.97).",1
15,7,"In total, data were collected from 640 exercises. On average, participants completed 3.89 exercises (SD=1.09, range 1 [n=9] to 10 [n=1]); most participants completed either three (n=91, 51 %) or four (n=46, 26 %) exercises. PCL-5 scores ranged from 0 to 76 (M=21.37, SD=19.22), with 86 participants (49 %) scoring in the non-PTSD range (PCL-5≤14), 53 (30 %) scoring in a mild-to-moderate PTSD symptom range (i.e., PCL-5 score between 15 and 37), and 37 participants (21 %) scoring at or above the cut-off score of 38 recommended for studies of the population prevalence of PTSD (Hoge et al. 2014; Weathers et al. 2013).",1

One-way ANOVAs indicated no significant differences between groups for ratings for any exercise type, although there were non-significant trends (p",1
15,9,"In general, the results of this pilot study suggest that participants considered the MMTT website as a highly credible and satisfactory self-help resource for meditation practice as well as for the learning and application of mindfulness and metta-related therapeutic principles to daily life. Participants tended to rate the website exercises as highly relevant, calming, enjoyable, and informative. With few exceptions, similar ratings were found irrespective of participants’ selfreported PTSD symptom severity, suggesting that the website exercises were considered potentially helpful not only in the context of treatment for trauma and stressor-related disorders but also more broadly in support of persons seeking to improve their self-regulation and well-being within the general population.",1
16,9,"Two samples were included in the present study, a community sample (n=326) and a clinically referred sample (n=197). Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.",1
16,10,"Attrition analyses on the non-responders from the assessment of test-retest reliability indicated that parents of children with a non-western background were less likely to respond at the 6-month follow-up (χ2 (1)=9.19, p",1
16,11,"In total, 326 parents (86.8 % mothers) of 2 to 8-year old (M=5.54, SD=1.40) children completed the ECBI. The sample included 165 boys and 161 girls. The classification criteria of Statistics Netherlands (2013) were used to classify each child’s ethnic background resulting in three categories. Most of the children (90.8 %) were classified as Dutch, 4.9 % were classified as other western (for example Spanish or French), and 4.3 % was classified as non-western. Parental education was categorized as low (no education or primary education), middle (secondary education) or high (higher academic education) (Statistics Netherlands 2014).",1
16,12,"The overall sample consisted of 277 parents and 197 children (122 boys and 75 girls) aged between 2.5 and 8.5 years (M=5.53, SD=1.36). The dates of birth of four children were unknown. For these children we were therefore not able to calculate their exact age. For all children (N=197) the mother was involved in the study. Additionally, for 79 children (40.1 %) both parents completed the questionnaires, because the father was also involved in treatment. The sample consisted of participants from a range of ethnic backgrounds, 54.7 % of the children were classified as Dutch, 1.8 % was classified as other western and 43.5 % was classified as nonwestern (mainly Moroccan and Turkish families).",1
16,13,"The Intensity Scale (IS) and the Problem Scale (PS) of the ECBI were included in this study The Intensity Scale measures the frequency of child behavior problems using a 7-point Likert scale (1 = never to 7 = always) and the overall score reflects the severity of disruptive behavior. The Problem Scale measures parental tolerance for their child’s misbehavior, which is measured by asking parents whether or not they view each of the described behaviors as problematic, using a dichotomous scale (1 = yes,0= no). The Dutch ECBI was translated and back-translated which resulted in a final version being approved by Psychological Assessment Resources (PAR). In the clinical sample, participant level data from the two treatment evaluation studies were pooled and two slightly different versions of the Dutch ECBI translations were used (i.e., minor differences in the wording of 12 of the 36 items). For example, item 11 (Argues/Discuses with parents about rules). Considering that differences were minor and preliminary analyses revealed no impact, we can assume that there were no effects of combining these two versions for the current study",1
16,14,"For most children in the clinically referred sample (n=137) a diagnostic assessment was conducted as part of the baseline assessment for the treatment evaluation study. For some families no diagnostic information was collected due to differences in clinical practice or practical issues, for example some families were not reached for the diagnostic interview before the start of treatment. Children were assessed for the presence of attention or hyperactivity problems, oppositional defiant behavior and conduct problem behavior based on the diagnostic criteria of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association 1994). Trained clinicians and psychiatrists administered these interviews and observations",1
16,19,"The internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha’s) of the ECBI scales was high in both the community sample (COS; IS & PS; α=.93) and the clinical sample (CLS; IS; α=.93, PS; α=.91). Also, coefficients of the father reports in the clinical sample were almost equal (IS; α=.93, PS; α=.92). The corrected item-total correlations indicated similar results in both samples, with coefficients for the ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales ranging from 0.09 (item 36, Wets the bed) to 0.73 (item 9, Refuses to obey until threatened with punishment). The median of these scores ranged from 0.46 (CLS-PS) to 0.55 (CLS-IS), indicating an overall satisfactory item-total correlation.",1
16,20,"In general, factor loadings of the ECBI Intensity and Problem Scale items on the first dominant factor were satisfactory and ranged from 0.09 (item 36, Wets the bed) to 0.76 (item 10, Acts defiant when told to do something). The median factor loading scores ranged from 0.50 (CLS-PS) to 0.59 (CLS-IS). In both samples ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales factor loadings for item 36 (Wets the bed) were low (",1
16,21,"Table 2 shows the mean scores for the ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales for both samples, organized by children’s age, sex and ethnicity, and informant’s gender and educational level. Subgroup analyses revealed significant sex differences in the ECBI Intensity Scale in the community sample; boys had higher scores than girls (t (324)=2.32, p=.02) and in the ECBI Problem Scale in the Clinical Sample (t (175)=2.50, p=.01). The effect sizes for these differences were small (COS; d=.26, CLS; d=.38). Additionally, in the clinical sample one-way ANOVAs revealed a significant effect for child ethnicity on the mother ECBI Intensity Scale (F=(2165) 10.88, p",1
16,22,"For all scales, correlations were lower between measures completed by fathers than those completed by mothers. Mothers were more likely to report similar behavior problems on the ECBI and SDQ than fathers. As expected, Table 4 shows higher correlations for the externalizing behavior SDQ scales compared to the SDQ Emotional Symptoms Scale (rS=.12 to .37) and the SDQ Peer Problems Scale (rS=.03 to .14). Also, the ECBI scales (and in particular the IS) were negatively correlated with the SDQ Prosocial Behavior Scale (rS=?.10 to ?.44).",1
16,23,"The purpose of the current study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the ECBI in Dutch children. The dimensionality, internal consistency, test-retest reliability (reproducibility), convergent, divergent and discriminative validity were examined and our results provide evidence for good psychometric qualities of the ECBI in the Netherlands. This is in line with our hypotheses and the previous findings from other international studies.",1
16,24,"Good convergent and divergent validity of the ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales were found with the SDQ in the clinical sample. This is similar with results found by Axberg et al. (2008) in a Swedish community sample. Also, in other studies which examined the correlations of the ECBI Intensity Scale and Problem Scale with other scales for child behavior problems (e.g. Boggs et al. 1990; Funderburk et al. 2003). The strong correlations between the Intensity and Problems Scales (ranging from 0.62 to 0.75) found in the present study, the similar pattern of correlations found for the construct validity, and the similarity of the patterns over different informants (mothers and fathers), raise questions about the usefulness of keeping both ECBI scales separate. Given the parsimony criteria, it can be suggested to combine both scales into a single scale. In contrast with this suggestion, Eyberg (1992) stressed the importance of both ECBI scales which measure related but also include distinct dimensions of disruptive behavior in children. Eyberg (1992) suggested that parental perceptions are the underlying construct of the development of the separate scales. The ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales may be especially useful in regard to parental tolerance (McMahon and Frick 2007).",1
16,31,"The results of the current study provide evidence that the ECBI is a psychometrically sound measure for indicating disruptive behavior problems in children in the Netherlands. Data suggests that the ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales are internally consistent and appropriately correlated with another well-established questionnaire (the SDQ). The ECBI Intensity Scale is also able to differentiate between diagnostic groups within the externalizing behavior spectrum. Based on the evidence found for the one-dimensional structure of the ECBI, the original defined ECBI Intensity and Problem Scales are useful for screening and intervention research purposes in a Dutch population. The use of weighted items could also improve the use of the ECBI for screening purposes and clinical research, but further investigation on this new area is recommended.",1
16,32,The current study was conducted with the informed consent of all participants. All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of a medical ethics committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.,1

16,34,"Language switching has been one of the main tasks to investigate language control, a process that restricts bilingual language processing to the target language. In the current review, we discuss the How (i.e., mechanisms) and Where (i.e., locus of these mechanisms) of language control in language switching. As regards the mechanisms of language control, we describe several empirical markers of language switching and their relation to inhibition, as a potentially important mechanism of language control. From this overview it becomes apparent that some, but not all, markers indicate the occurrence of inhibition during language switching and, thus, language control. In a second part, we turn to the potential locus of language control and the role of different processing stages (concept level, lemma level, phonology, orthography, and outside language processing). Previous studies provide evidence for the employment of several of these processing stages during language control so that either a complex control mechanism involving different processing stages and/or multiple loci of language control have to be assumed. Based on the discussed results, several established and new theoretical avenues are considered.",1
16,35,"When bilinguals process language, words from the non-target language can be activated, and sometimes even selected by mistake (e.g., Costa, Caramazza, & Sebastián-Gallés, 2000; Gollan, Sandoval, & Salmon, 2011; Hermans, Bongaerts, De Bot, & Schreuder, 1998). Therefore, it is crucial to restrict bilingual language production to the target language and to reduce between-language interference during bilingual language comprehension. This restriction process, called language control, appears to be very effective because very few non-target language words get selected during bilingual language production (e.g., Gollan et al., 2011; Poulisse & Bongaerts, 1994). One commonly used task to investigate the underlying mechanism of language control is language switching",1
17,11,"From these different paradigms we can extrapolate that, regardless of whether language cues or stimuli are presented, switching languages usually contains a performance cost (i.e., switch costs and/or mixing costs). Thus, we conclude that performance costs in experimental language switching are a common empirical observation in all variants of language switching, with the exception of voluntary language switching under certain circumstances (Gollan & Ferreira, 2009; Gollan, Kleinman, et al., 2014). Next to this commonality, each paradigm comes with its own advantages and disadvantages.",1
17,12,"The cued language switching paradigm, for example, can rely on a large amount and variety of research on language switching in language production tasks (as comprehension tasks usually do not implement cues, research is much more limited in this domain). Hence, we have extensive knowledge of the effects and processes at work during cued language switching.",1
17,13,"Another advantage of the cued language switching paradigm are the modifications of several time-based intervals, such as the cue-to-stimulus interval, which is assumed to measure active language preparation, and the response-to-cue interval, which is assumed to measure passive decay (e.g., Kiesel et al., 2010). These time-based intervals cannot be manipulated as easily in the other language switching paradigms.",1
17,14,"The alternating language switching paradigm allows for language preplanning, as the bilingual knows when switching to another language will occur, which is similar to preplanning during natural language production. Hence, he or she could prepare for the upcoming language based on the predictable sequence.",1
17,15,"Even closer to natural language switching in this respect is the voluntary language switching paradigm because it does not rely on exogenous language cues but on endogenous (i.e., internal) language cues and thus also allows for language preplanning. Additionally, the voluntary language switching paradigm allows for other measures, namely when and how often bilinguals will switch between languages. These additional measures could give us more insight into the mechanism of language control during language switching.",1
17,16,"Finally, the SBLS paradigm also allows for sequential predictability of language control. Yet, whereas this is restricted to language predictability in the alternating language switching and voluntary language switching paradigms, it encompasses the entire word in the SBLS paradigm. Another advantage of this paradigm is that all word categories can be investigated, since the memory-based concept sequence allows for a large variety of words. Yet, this is also possible with other paradigms when they employ written words.",1
17,17,"Taken together, a large variety of language switching paradigms with individual strengths and weaknesses can be used to study language control in language switching. The common idea of all of the paradigms is that they allow researchers to explore how language control operates and which processes play a crucial role in language switching.",1
17,18,"An influential model of language control is the inhibitory control model (ICM; Green, 1998), which explains switch costs with the notion of persisting inhibition: when on a trial (trial n1) a certain language has to be produced, the non-target language will be inhibited. In turn, when the previously inhibited language is required for production on the next trial (trial n; i.e., switch trial), the inhibition that was exercised on trial n-1 will persist into trial n and thus will have to be overcome. This is not the case when producing in the same language on trial n-1 and trial n (i.e., repetition trial). So, it should be harder to switch between languages than repeating the same language because persisting inhibition has to be overcome in switch trials. Green also assumed that the inhibitory process is reactive, meaning that a larger activation will lead to more inhibition.",1
17,19,"Whereas the ICM is more production-based, the bilingual interactive activation model (BIA; Grainger & Dijkstra, 1992), and later variants of this model, such as the BIA+ (Dijkstra & van Heuven, 2002) or the BIA-d (Grainger, Midgley, & Holcomb, 2010), focused on comprehensionbased language control. This model can account for switch costs by bottom-up activation of word representations to language nodes, which are mental language representations, and top-down inhibition of the irrelevant and, thus, competing language (node). During a switch trial another language node needs to be activated, and in turn interferes with processing, whereas during repetition trials the same language node is activated and thus processing can occur without language interference. Consequently, switch costs should occur.",1
17,20,"Next to these inhibition-based models there are also language control models that do not rely on inhibition (e.g., Costa, Miozzo, & Caramazza, 1999; Finkbeiner et al., 2006; La Heij, 2005; Roelofs, 1998). La Heij (2005), for example, proposed that a language representation of the target language receives additional activation from a corresponding language cue, thus making inhibition redundant.",1
17,21,"While the latter models propose that no inhibition occurs during language switching, inhibition has been suggested as an explanation for several language switching measures, such as asymmetrical switch costs, n-2 language repetition costs, and reversed language proficiency in mixed language blocks. In the following subsections we will discuss these markers and their relation to inhibition.",1
17,22,"A first concern is that several studies did not find asymmetrical switch costs (e.g., Christoffels et al., 2007; Verhoef et al., 2010; for reversed asymmetrical switch costs, see Declerck, Stephan, et al., 2015b), an observation that has also been found in task switching (for a review, see Koch, Gade, Schuch, & Philipp, 2010). This is especially marked in comprehension studies, where typically no asymmetrical switch costs are observed (e.g., Macizo et al., 2012; Thomas & Allport, 2000). Furthermore, symmetrical switch costs are usually observed with highly proficient bilinguals in production tasks (e.g., Costa & Santesteban, 2004; Costa, Santesteban, & Ivanova, et al., 2006). This finding is conceived as evidence that highly proficient bilinguals do not use inhibition during language control (for a more detailed discussion on highly proficient bilinguals and inhibition see below). Hence, asymmetrical switch costs seem to depend on the type of task and on the bilinguals.",1
17,23,"This unclear pattern raises some questions about the reactive inhibitory nature of language control in language switching. Yet, to reconcile the idea of reactive inhibition, language dominance and overall naming speed, one might suggest that language dominance influences the asymmetry of switch costs at an earlier processing stage in language processing than the overall naming speed is influenced (cf. Declerck, Thoma, Koch, & Philipp, 2015c).",1
17,24,"A final, more theoretical, concern is that asymmetrical switch costs can also be explained with mechanisms different from inhibition. For example, the notion of reactive activation (Philipp et al., 2007) entails that L2 requires a relatively larger amount of activation than L1 on trial n-1. This increase of activation will persist into trial n, thus causing a more considerable competitor for L1 than L2 on switch trials. So, asymmetrical switch costs can be explained without the notion of inhibition, using a similar logic as Green (1998) proposed.1 Yet, this interpretation comes with similar concerns as the ICM.",1
17,25,"A different interpretation of asymmetrical switch costs proposes that the initial response of switch trials can be rejected when these are too fast (Finkbeiner et al., 2006). This is meant to prevent errors, as switch trials are supposed to be difficult and thus no fast responses can be given in this difficult situation. Since L1 trials are more dominant, they are generally also easier and thus faster. Hence, more initial L1 switch responses will be rejected than L2 switch responses, leading to larger L1 than L2 switch costs.",1
17,26,"The final account of asymmetrical switch costs was proposed by Verhoef et al. (2009). These authors speculated that the switch cost asymmetry across languages is due to a larger L1-repetition benefit than L2-repetition benefit. This interpretation comes from the assumption that interference of the nontarget language influences all trial types except L1 repetition trials, which are thus always the fastest. To test this hypothesis, Verhoef and colleagues investigated the effect of language preparation time on asymmetrical switch costs. More specifically, they manipulated the cue-to-stimulus interval, which allows for more (long interval) or less (short interval) language preparation. Their results showed that longer language preparation led to symmetrical switch costs with DutchEnglish bilinguals, whereas short language preparation led to asymmetrical switch costs. Furthermore, they found that all trials benefited from longer language preparation time, apart from L1-repetition trials. The latter finding is an indication that all trial types, apart from the L1-repetition trials, suffer from language interference.",1
17,27,"Yet, no preparation-based difference in asymmetrical switch costs was found in other language switching studies that investigated the effect of language preparation (Costa & Santesteban, 2004; Declerck et al., 2015a; Fink & Goldrick, 2015; Philipp et al., 2007). Furthermore, Fink and Goldrick (2015) also looked into the effect of language preparation time on L1 repetition trials. According to Verhoef et al. (2009) these types of trials should be unaffected by language preparation. In contrast, Fink and Goldrick (2015) observed a preparation benefit for these trials. Taken together, the lack of replication of Verhoef et al.’s (2009) behavioral findings seems to put into question the idea that L1 repetition trials are not affected by language interference. Consequently, the idea of an L1-repetition benefit to explain asymmetrical switch costs should be reexamined.",1
17,28,"Taken together, there are several different explanations to account for the switch cost asymmetry, but each of these explanations seems to fall short to account for the observed language switching data. This begs the question of what asymmetrical switch costs really measure. Philipp et al. (2007) have argued that asymmetrical switch costs could be explained by more than one process. Specifically, they argued that a combination of persisting activation and a small role for persisting inhibition could explain most results. We concur with the idea that asymmetrical switch costs might be the sum of more than one process and thus not an ideal measure for solely persisting, reactive inhibition.",1
17,29,"Unlike asymmetrical switch costs, n-2 language repetition costs cannot be explained by persisting activation, since an opposite pattern would be observed (i.e., n-2 language repetition benefit). Further, up to now, there is no alternative explanation for n-2 language repetition costs (for a review of n-2 repetition costs in task switching, see Koch et al., 2010), which makes this a less ambiguous marker for the notion of inhibition in language switching.",1
17,30,"Yet, similar to switch costs, the specific pattern of n-2 repetition costs across languages is not consistent. Both Philipp et al. (2007) and Guo et al. (2013a, Experiment 1) observed an asymmetry of n-2 language repetition costs across languages with larger L1 n-2 language repetition costs than with L3. However, no such effect was observed in the second Experiment of Guo and colleagues and in either experiment of Philipp and Koch (2009). Furthermore, only Philipp et al. (2007) observed larger L1 n-2 language repetition costs than with L2. Moreover, while Guo and colleagues (Experiments 1 and 2) found larger L2 n-2 language repetition costs than with L3, Philipp et al. (2007) found an opposite effect. This mixed data pattern does not speak against persisting inhibition as n-2 repetition costs were consistently found. Yet, we suppose that this data pattern indicates that there are multiple influences on language activation (e.g., language dominance, recency of language use,…) and its relation to inhibition. Moreover, the complexity of the data pattern might also indicate that different loci of inhibition could play a role (e.g., Bobb & Wodniecka, 2013; Gollan, Schotter, Gomez, Murillo, & Rayner, 2014; Kroll, Bobb, & Wodniecka, 2006), and that the involvement of specific loci is dependent on the level of language activation. Consequently, different patterns of performance costs can be observed across languages in different studies due to differences in language activation.",1
17,42,"This also leads to an important question—namely, whether solely inhibition is required for language control or whether other processes, such as activation (Philipp et al., 2007), also play an important role during language control. The implementation of several processes (e.g., inhibition and activation) during language switching could very well be the case even though evidence for inhibition has been found in language switching, because inhibition and activation are not mutually exclusive processes. These different types of language control processes could also occur at different processing stages of language processing (Bobb & Wodniecka 2013; Gollan, Schotter, et al., 2014; Kroll et al., 2006). Regrettably, mainly inhibition has been used to explain language switching results, while other processes have been mostly ignored. So, at this point the involvement of processes other than inhibition remains unclear, making research into this field an important avenue for future research",1
17,43,"The conclusion that bilingual language control appears to rely, at least partially, on inhibitory processes, is not specific to the question of what is inhibited in language control and when this inhibition occurs. Language processing, both in language production and language comprehension, entails different processing stages and each of these processing stages could play a crucial role for language control.",1
17,44,"Spoken word production (e.g., Levelt, Roelofs, & Meyer, 1999) starts with the formation of a nonlinguistic concept, at which stage the to-be-expressed information is formed. Next, syntactic information is included at the lemma level, followed by the addition of sound representations at the phonological level. Finally, articulation occurs, which involves activation of the necessary muscles.",1
7,1,"The effects of testing on memory are well-known, but the specific ways in which testing negatively impacts memory are not fully understood. The study focuses on ""output interference"" (OI), which refers to a decrease in accuracy that occurs over the course of testing. While OI has been researched in relation to episodic memory, there has been limited exploration of its impact on semantic memory. In the study, participants were tested twice on their factual knowledge and received corrective feedback during the first test. OI was not observed during the first test, but it was present during the second test, particularly for questions that had been answered incorrectly during the first test. This suggests that episodic memory is more susceptible to interference than semantic memory. Possible explanations for this finding are discussed.",0
7,2,"Understanding the importance of testing and its use as a learning tool is crucial, especially as high-stakes testing becomes more prevalent in education. What is particularly intriguing about the benefits of testing is the difference in the impact of information learned through testing compared to the same amount of time spent solely studying. For example, individuals tend to retain information better if they complete a free recall test as opposed to simply reviewing the material (Karpicke & Roediger, 2008; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006a). Despite the reliable and robust benefits of testing (see Delaney, Verkoeijen, & Spirgel, 2010; Karpicke, Lehman, & Aue, 2014; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006b for reviews), there are also negative consequences associated with testing (see Malmberg, Lehman, Annis, Criss, & Shiffrin, 2014). For instance, recalling a subset of memorized items based on a specific cue during a test may impede the retrieval of other items from the same group (Malmberg, Criss, Gangwani, & Shiffrin, 2012; Roediger, 1973; Slamecka, 1968). One significant drawback of testing is the finding that performance decreases throughout the test list (Criss, Malmberg, & Shiffrin, 2011; Murdock & Anderson, 1975; Ratcliff & Hockley, 1980; Roediger, 1974; Roediger & Schmidt, 1980). This phenomenon, called ""output interference"" (OI), is thought to occur as a result of encoding during the test, either through updating existing memories with new information gained during testing or by adding new traces to episodic memory. As a result, items tested toward the end of the test list may suffer from additional interference generated by the new information added to memory throughout the testing process (Criss et al., 2011).",0
7,14,"The study found that output interference (OI) varied depending on whether it was the first or second time the questions were answered. No OI was observed during the initial test, but a strong OI effect was seen during the second test, where participants had received corrective feedback. This effect was mostly limited to questions that were answered incorrectly on the first test. The authors suggested that this suggests that OI is primarily associated with episodic memory.",0

9,1,"The paradox of crying's mood-enhancing benefits in retrospective studies and its negative effects on mood in quasi-experimental laboratory studies is explained by the fact that criers experience an initial deterioration in mood immediately after crying, followed by a recovery that results in even better mood enhancement than non-criers. This was determined through a study of 28 objectively established criers and 32 non-criers who watched an emotional movie and rated their mood before and after the film, as well as 20 and 90 minutes later. While crying frequency did not predict the extent of mood changes, the observed relation between crying and mood recovery supports earlier retrospective studies.",0
9,2,"Humans possess the unique ability to cry emotional tears, a behavior commonly observed and culturally prevalent (Trimble 2012; Vingerhoets 2013; Vingerhoets and Bylsma 2015). Despite this, there has been scant attention from researchers, and the understanding of its purpose remains limited. The theories regarding the functions of crying can be divided into two categories (Vingerhoets 2013; Vingerhoets et al. 2009). Firstly, the catharsis effect theory highlights the individual benefits of crying and its ability to promote recovery and homeostasis. Secondly, the inter-individual functions of crying focus on communication of helplessness and the need for support, leading to comfort and succor (Hasson 2009). These positions are not mutually exclusive and receiving emotional support may contribute to an improved sense of wellbeing. Crying could be viewed as a form of coping behavior, serving to facilitate emotional recovery and persuading others to act, from the perspective of stress theory (Vingerhoets 2013).",0
9,3,"When attempting to clarify contradictory results, it is crucial to consider certain methodological issues. In studies that rely on retrospectively reported data, participants are generally allowed to choose which crying episodes they want to describe, which could skew the results. There is a concern that individuals may have a preference for reporting crying experiences that align with the common belief that crying can lead to feeling better. Another issue with this type of study is that participants usually report their feelings following crying without specifying the precise timeframe. While it may be difficult for participants to recall the exact sequence of mood changes, it is possible that people experience a temporary dip in their mood before experiencing a subsequent mood improvement after crying. Given that we lack detailed information on how mood changes unfold after crying, we are unable to fully understand the common notion that crying leads to emotional recovery.",0
9,4,"The study aims to investigate the impact of crying on mood in a controlled laboratory environment. To ensure the findings are applicable to a wider population, a diverse range of stimuli that elicit both negative and positive emotions will be employed. Based on previous research, the study hypothesizes that individuals who cry in response to the emotional films will experience a more substantial increase in negative affect immediately after viewing compared to those who do not cry. Additionally, the study anticipates that individuals who cry will experience greater overall mood improvement in delayed measurements, including recovery from initial mood deterioration. Finally, the study expects that the number of crying episodes will correlate with changes in negative affect over time.",0
9,5,"The study began with 46 female and 26 male students, aged 19-33 (mean age=23.80, standard deviation=3.19), who volunteered for the course credits.

9,6,"The shortened version of the Emotional States Scale, developed by Kardum and Bezinovi膰 in 1992, was utilized to assess NA. The scale comprised 18 items on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (I do not feel this way at all) to 5 (I feel this way completely). The items included nervous, bad-tempered, anxious, weepy, tense, guilty, helpless, sad, angry, miserable, rejected, fearful, cheerful, generous, relaxed, calm, active, and merry (last six items were reversely keyed). Adequate internal consistency was observed, with the Cronbach鈥檚 alphas ranging from .77 to .84 over the four measurements.",0
9,7,"The participants were seated individually in a room equipped with a monitor, speakers, and video camera, located about 60cm away from them. Once the participants signed the informed consent form, they were asked to complete the first mood rating (T1), following which they were randomly exposed to one of two films. After watching the film, the participants were asked to fill in a short questionnaire on their emotional responses, not relevant to the scope of the study. Thereafter, the second mood measurement (T2) was taken, following which the participants were accompanied by the experimenter to another room, where they completed additional questionnaires, also not relevant to the study. 20 minutes post T2, the participants completed the mood questionnaire for the third time (T3). The participants were provided with instructions and an envelope containing the mood scale, which they were requested to complete and return immediately after receiving an SMS via mobile phone. The fourth mood measurement (T4) was taken 90 minutes after the second one and 60 minutes post leaving the laboratory, without any instructions given on behavior until T4. Participants responded to the mood scale items on T4 via text message, sending 18 numbers to the experimenter.",0
9,8,"Test were conducted to check for confounding variables, followed by a mixed ANOVA to compare changes in NA between participants who cried and those who did not cry. Two separate ANOVAs were performed to analyze changes within each group and Bonferroni post hoc tests were used to compare NA between specific measurements. An additional ANOVA was also performed to validate the possibility of low mood in criers stimulating successful mood enhancing behaviors. Covariates used were age, gender, and NA change from T1 to T2.",0
9,9,"To prepare the data for regression analyses, the frequency of crying episodes (FCE) variable was created by aggregating the crying measure across all observed scenes with crying. Three multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine if FCE predicted changes in negative affect (NA) at relevant points in time. The first block of each analysis included age, gender, and NA at T1 as predictors, while FCE was included as a predictor in the second block. The effects of FCE (i.e. the second block) are reported here. To prevent the inflation of the effects of crying, only crying participants were included in these regression analyses.",0
9,10,"Based on the data presented in Figure 1, our hypothesis about distinct mood changes in the crying and noncrying group was confirmed. This is supported by a significant main effect of time [F(3, 53) = 5.64; p = .002; partial g2 = .09] and a significant time by group interaction [F(2, 36) = 5.11; p = .003; partial g2 = .08]. However, there was no main effect of group [F(1, 55) = .83; p = .365; partial g2 = .02].",0
9,11,"Two ANOVAs were conducted to examine whether there was a significant mood change in each of the two groups. The non-criers group did not show any significant changes in their Negative Affect (NA) during the four measurements. Meanwhile, the criers group showed a significant effect of time on their NA, where it increased from T1 to T2 and decreased from T2 to T3 and T4. The decrease in NA from T1 to T4 in the criers group was significant, indicating overall mood improvements following crying. The predicted NA decrease remained significant even when NA change from T1 to T2 was included as a covariate. Bonferroni correction was applied during post hoc comparisons.",0
9,12,"When the ANOVA was redone to include six participants who experienced their last crying episode before the final scene of the movie, the overall mood change among the crying group became marginally significant [F(3,29)=1.76; p=.093; partial g2=.08]. However, all the anticipated mood changes (T1-T2, T2-T4 and T1-T4) remained significant (p<.001, p<.001 and p=.003, respectively). Similarly to the previous analysis, no significant change in mood was detected in the non-crying group.",0
10,15,"The ANOVA on the error data showed that trial type had a significant main effect, indicating more errors on incongruent compared to congruent trials.

This association was significant with a correlation coefficient of -0.54 and a p-value of 0.003. The effect passed Bonferroni correction. A similar pattern was observed between self-reported hedonic tone on the SHPS and cue-related activation in the lateral globus pallidus. A positive correlation was found between greater hedonic tone and greater cue-related activation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.45 and a p-value of 0.02. However, this correlation did not pass Bonferroni correction. Scattered plots for both correlations are presented in Figure 5A and 5B.",0
10,17,"Regions in the DLPFC and BG that exhibited a noteworthy reward context effect had two distinct outcomes. The top section of Table 4 indicated that these areas had reduced target-related activation on RC compared to RCXT or BCXT trials. Specifically, decreased target-related activation was observed in the medial portion of the right DLPFC during RC and RCXT trials, when compared to BCXT trials. However, the study noted that certain subcortical regions, such as the lateral globus pallidus, did not show significant variations in target-related activity in Time Point 4. However, Time Point 7 had a greater deactivation on RC than BCXT and RCXT trials. The lower section of the table demonstrated that other larger, more lateral, and posterior areas in the DLPFC exhibited more activation on RC than BCXT trials. Further, Supplemental Fig. 2 presented the time courses of each region in the DLPFC.",0
10,18,"The study found that the activation in the bilateral DLPFC and various subcortical regions related to reward, such as the lateral globus pallidus and caudate, increased when presented with incentive cues as compared to no-incentive cues. This result was consistent with previous studies that also showed increases in a network of regions involved in cognitive control, such as the lateral PFC and parietal cortex. (Owen, McMillan, Laird, & Bullmore, 2005; Wager & Smith, 2003; Padmala & Pessoa, 2011; Vassena et al., 2014).",0
10,19,"The DLPFC, recognized as a vital part of cognitive control, has been found to represent both reward-related value and task goals. Studies have shown that it is strongly connected to regions that are involved in value representations, such as the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. The DLPFC also projects to the BG, including the caudate nucleus and globus pallidus, with projections terminating in the thalamus, which in turn, projects back to the DLPFC and premotor and motor cortices. Increased DLPFC and striatal activations in response to incentive cues may indicate enhanced neural representations of reward value through a top-down regulation of activations in this circuit.",0
10,20,"The study found that specific regions in the BG displayed increased activity during reward situations, which builds on previous research indicating that fronto-parietal networks can show sustained elevation in relation to reward information. While earlier studies showed sustained increases in the parietal cortex and PFC in reward contexts, they did not observe effects in the BG. This study used a targeted ROI method, whereas previous studies employed voxelwise whole-brain analysis, which may have made it easier to detect sustained effects in both prefrontal and striatal regions. This prolonged activity may reflect the BG's hypothesized contribution to reward-based learning and goal-oriented behavior. More specifically, the dorsal striatum receives widespread inputs from the DLPFC and other frontal regions, and prolonged activity in this area during reward contexts may indicate an attempt to maintain information relevant to obtaining rewards, improving preparation throughout the reward situation.",0
10,21,"The study found that individuals with greater trait anhedonia had less neural activation when presented with reward-predicting cues, but there was no significant relationship between anhedonia and sustained context-dependent activation during reward contexts. This supports the idea that anhedonia affects the experience of rewards and how they alter brain activation and behavior in response to explicit presentation of reward cues. However, it does not support the notion that anhedonia affects global effects of incentives in sustained brain activation or behavioral effects. These findings suggest that individual differences in anhedonia may impact goal-directed behavior due to a lack of positive experiences/expectations of rewards.",0
10,22,"The study offers valuable insights into a potential neural mechanism that underlies anhedonia. However, it has certain limitations that may be addressed in future studies. For instance, the researchers did not observe significant reductions in conflict effects in either accuracy or RT. Although they found an increase in RT as a result of reward, there was no compromise in accuracy. Furthermore, the team concentrated their analyses on the DLPFC and the basal ganglia and did not detect any regions exhibiting interaction effects of reward context and trial type in the target phase. While it is not possible to rule out the possibility that the present task may have been too challenging for individuals outside of a clinical population and detrimental to their cognitive control, future studies should explore the difficulty level of performance tasks. In conclusion, the findings show both persistent context-dependent and temporary cue-driven impacts of reward on cognitive control, which the DLPFC and basal ganglia are believed to support. A notable discovery is that self-reported anhedonia trait in healthy adults is linked to temporary neural activity in the lateral globus pallidus during reward predictions but not with sustained DLPFC activity.",0
10,23,"The fixed-order presentation of the baseline and reward conditions may have caused a sustained context-dependent effect, but it is unlikely that the differences between reward conditions were due to practice effects. Previous empirical evidence shows that reward incentives have a consistent effect on cognitive control, as seen in the AX-continuous performance task. The differences between RCXT and RC trials are also unlikely to be due to practice effects, as these trials were interleaved.",0
10,24,"The current state-item design enabled the separation of sustained and transient effects of rewards to some extent. However, to further distinguish these effects, additional methods could be implemented in future research. Specifically, the current design did not allow for the estimation of sustained rewards in trials lacking transient effects. As an alternative, future studies could incorporate conditions in which participants were informed about a bonus at the end of a set of trials and no individual reward cues. This would produce a crossed design that tests the effects of the overall sustained reward manipulation and trial-specific reward manipulation.",0

11,1,The study followed 74 children with Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified for 7 years. The researchers explored the rates and stability of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children: Parent version at ages 6-12 and 12-20. They also examined childhood factors that could predict the stability of comorbid psychiatric disorders. The rate of comorbid psychiatric disorders decreased from childhood (81%) to adolescence (61%). The stability of psychiatric comorbidity was significantly predicted by higher levels of parent-reported stereotyped behaviors and reduced social interest in childhood. The authors suggest that revisiting psychiatric comorbidity should be practiced as some individuals changed in comorbid diagnoses.,0

However, those whose parents participated in both waves had higher IQ scores (M = 92.96, SE = 16.96) than those whose parents only participated in wave 1 (M = 83.94, SE = 16.88; t(86) = -2.01, p = .05).",0

This finding was not aligned with our expectation of higher self-reported rates of internalizing problems. However, we did find a slightly higher rate of self-reported depressive symptoms (18.2% - subclinical range), as opposed to the parent-reported DISC-P wave 2 rate of 10.8%, which was in line with our expectation. Unfortunately, we cannot directly compare DISC-P data and YSR data due to the different properties of these instruments and the lack of comparative research.

12,1,"In two separate experiments, rats were exposed to the taste of almond in combination with either fructose or maltodextrin. The rats' preference for the taste of almond was then evaluated, with half of the rats having prior exposure to the taste on its own, and the other half having no prior exposure. Experiment 1 showed that when the rats were hungry during the test, nonpreexposed subjects had a greater preference for the taste of almond, regardless of whether they were trained with fructose or maltodextrin. This indicates that latent inhibition was present with both reinforcers. In Experiment 2, when the rats were not food deprived prior to the test, there was no latent inhibition observed for either reinforcer. Instead, the preference was greater for preexposed subjects than for nonpreexposed subjects. The results do not provide evidence for the idea that different types of reinforcers promote different types of learning. Instead, they suggest that different forms of learning control behavior when a rat is hungry versus when it is not, and that the form that generates the preference in the latter case is not susceptible to the latent inhibition effect.",0
12,2,"In classical conditioning, prior exposure to the event used as the conditioned stimulus (CS) typically slows down the acquisition of the conditioned response. This phenomenon is known as latent inhibition and has been observed in various conditioning procedures. However, the flavor-preference conditioning procedure used in these experiments has shown an exception to this rule. Rats were given a nonpreferred flavor in combination with a sucrose solution, and after training, they demonstrated an increased preference for the flavored water. Exposure to the CS before conditioning produced different results, with some studies showing a reduction in preference and others showing no effect.",0
12,3,"Several mechanisms can contribute to the preference established with sucrose as the US. Sucrose has a sweet taste and also has nutritive postoral consequences, which makes each property capable of promoting preference conditioning. A non-nutritive substance like saccharin can serve as an effective US using flavor-taste learning. Additionally, a preference can also develop when a nutrient US is delivered through intragastric infusion known as flavor-nutrient learning. Sucrose supports both forms of learning as it helps create a preference regardless of its taste properties.",0
12,4,"To examine the findings of Garcia-Burgos et al. (2013), it would be beneficial to have specific procedures in place that permit the separate inspection of flavor-nutrient and flavor-taste learning. This would help to demonstrate latent inhibition in the former case and not in the latter. Although some preliminary insights have been gained from unconventional methodologies, they are not conclusive. In particular, Weingarten and Kulikovsky (1989) suggested that the pre-exposure to a flavor impedes the association between flavor and food after rats responded to sham-feeding experiments. Conversely, Galef and Durlach's (1993) research involving the demonstration of food flavor by one rat to another yielded opposite results. These studies are suggestive and consistent with the theory under consideration, but alternative conclusions could exist. Therefore, this study aims to standardize preference conditioning techniques and employ non-sucrose-based USs to isolate flavor-nutrient and flavor-taste education.",0
12,5,"The effects of different USs may be more complex than stated. Intragastric fructose can lead to preference learning but to a lesser extent than sucrose. Myers and Sclafani found that rats responded positively to flavors associated with sugar infusion, indicating that flavor-nutrient learning could impact the hedonic response to a flavor. Despite this, comparing fructose with maltodextrin has been successful in studying flavor-preference learning. The study aimed to find latent inhibition in rats trained with either fructose or maltodextrin as the US, which could support the hypothesis that different mechanisms create preferences established by these USs. If there's a difference with maltodextrin but not fructose, it confirms that the mechanism of fructose, presumed to be flavor-taste learning, isn't susceptible to latent inhibition.",0
12,6,"During the study, four groups of rats were created. Two groups were given preexposure to the almond flavor that was going to be used as the CS, while the other two groups received only water during this stage. In the conditioning stage, one pair of groups consumed a mixture of almond and fructose, and the other pair consumed a mixture of almond and maltodextrin. In the final test, all subjects had access to two bottles, one containing the almond solution, and the other containing unflavored water. To ensure that rats would drink the fluids provided, they were deprived of water throughout training. Although the rats had free access to food during preexposure and conditioning, food access was denied to all subjects before the test to determine the preference based on flavor-nutrient learning, which is more evident in hungry animals.",0
12,7,"The University of Granada Ethics Committee approved all experimental procedures. The deprivation schedule began by removing water bottles 24 hours before the experiment, and the rats were given three days to adjust to the twice-daily water access schedule. The rats were divided into two weight-matched groups for the flavor exposure phase: group Pre (n = 16) and group NPre (n = 16). During the phase, the rats were given 10 ml of either almond (Pre) or water (NPre) once daily for eight days, followed by free water access. Afterward, the rats were split into four groups based on their almond or water consumption for the conditioning phase: Pre/M (n = 8), NPre/M (n = 8), Pre/F (n = 8), and NPre/F (n = 8).",0
12,8,"After two days of conditioning, each day with one trial in the morning session, the rats were given 10 minutes to access 10 ml of either almond + maltodextrin (groups M) or almond + fructose (groups F). To prevent any pairing of the flavor with the standard diet, food was removed during this time. After the last conditioning session, the rats were given a second 30-minute access to water at 5:30 p.m. instead of 1:30 p.m., and food was removed at 6:00 p.m. On the next day, the rats were tested while food-deprived with 15-minute access to two bottles at 10:00 a.m. containing 20 ml of almond solution and 20 ml of water, respectively. The positions of the bottles were counterbalanced across groups.",0
12,14,"The figure in the right of Fig. 1 shows the mean preference ratios for each group, now renamed as TTT. The scores for maltodextrin were slightly higher than for fructose. Contrary to the results of Experiment 1, the groups preexposed to almond displayed a higher preference for almond regardless of the reinforcer. This unexpected reversal of the latent inhibition effect led to significant main effects of preexposure and reinforcer on the preference ratios, according to ANOVA results. The main effect of preexposure yielded F(1, 28) = 5.17, p = .031, 畏p 2 = .16, and the main effect of reinforcer had F(1, 28) = 5.48, p = .027, 畏p 2 = .16, while the interaction was not significant (F < 1).",0
76,20,"The response in the foreign trade sector was much greater than even the optimists anticipated. As already seen, export earnings rose dramatically, and India was much more integrated into the world economy, although its share of world exports was still low (at 1%) contrasted with its share in the early 1950s. Although there is some indication that export growth may have slowed in the last half of 2007 and early 2008, merchandise export growth averaged over 20% annually from 2003–2004 to 2005–2006, the last year for which data are available. In addition, service exports grew exceptionally rapidly, more than doubling in each of the three most recent years. Indeed, in 2005/06, India had a positive services balance equal to 3% of GDP.",1
76,21,"Some observers have questioned whether the success of Indian IT services was the result of government intervention and government policies. In fact, however, the opposite seems to be the case: the IT sector started its rapid growth period without significant government encouragement. Indeed, a major factor seems to have been that it is a service industry that was not subject to significant government regulation during its early period. Hence, it was able to become established with much less government intervention than was the case with many other industries. In addition, the IT industry was much less dependent on Indian infrastructure than were most other manufactures. Satellite communications were a major vehicle for transmission of product between foreign buyers and Indian providers. The success of the Indian IT sector exceeded all expectations of what India could achieve, and has resulted in a considerable increase in optimism about India’s economic capabilities. This last may be the most important contribution of the IT sector to India’s economic policy and growth prospects.",1
76,22,"It was already stated that momentum for reform has dwindled sharply in the past 3 or so years. For the future, the key questions are whether the reform momentum has largely stalled for the foreseeable future and, if so, what are the growth prospects and what reforms are needed in the short to medium run to maintain or accelerate growth.",1
77,1,"The evolution and outcomes of conflicts in Europe, including the current one in Ukraine, have been influenced by the dynamics of economic, technological and military balances, which in turn are affected by the economic warfare and sanctions that have been used to alter them. This article reviews defence economic concepts of relevance to the Ukraine conflict and then draws out lessons for the present concerning power balances, military capabilities, conventional deterrence, economic warfare and counter-measures against sanctions from experiences in Europe in the twentieth century. An evaluation is made of the impacts of economic sanctions on Russia and Ukraine in 2014–2016.",1
77,2,"The analysis is divided into two inter-related components, both covering the period 19172016. The first is concerned with the assessment of: the organisation and performance of the defence sectors in the economies of the USSR and Russia; trends in defence capabilities, economic and military balances, and conventional deterrence in Europe; the adequacy of resources allocated to support NATO, including its expansion in the 2000s; and comparison of the economic power and military capabilities of Russia and Ukraine in 2013–2016. The second section evaluates the causes and features of Western economic warfare directed at the USSR/Russia, as well as Russian responses and economic results in the periods 1917–1945, 1945–1991 and 1992–2013. it then describes Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia in connection with the Ukraine conflict and assesses their economic, military and political impacts. The remainder of this introduction reviews concepts related to these main sections.",1
77,3,"The concept of economic power of relevance to national security concerns what Knorr (1957, p. 8) called ‘economic defense potential’, which is determined by the volume and rate of growth of GDP, the structure and flexibility of output at the sector level, and capabilities in science and technology. Economic power is produced by an economic system that is governed by economic policies and functions in a multi-dimensional economic environment (Gregory & Stuart, 1999). OECD/NATO countries have had competitive and open market economies, which over time have performed well at macro and micro levels in the generation of economic power. in contrast, the USSR/CMEA countries had centralised, state-owned, planned and closed economies. These developed the characteristics of a ‘shortage economy’, which generated rapid extensive economic growth but inhibited efficiency and technological progress (Davis & Charemza, 1989; Kornai, 1980, 1992). Following the collapse of the communist/ command systems in Europe, all countries engaged in the processes of economic transition. Those in East Europe and the Baltic region made rapid progress to market economies and joined the EU. But Russia, Ukraine and other states that emerged from the USSR developed hybrid economic systems (part market, part state) that performed poorly in the 1990s.",1
77,4,"Similar points were made by Lenin and early Soviet defence economists (Davis, 1991a). During World War ii all major countries not only studied the problem of how to convert economic power into military capabilities, but also implemented policies in their war economies to accomplish this, with varying degrees of success. in the post-war period Knorr (1957, p. 7, 1973) argued that ‘defense potential’was dependent not only on economic power, but also on the efficiency of the utilisation of resources devoted to defence (organisational ability) and on the‘will to provide for military power’(e.g. share of GDP devoted to defence). Studies of economic power and security have been continued up to the present (Fels, Kremer, & Kronenberg, 2012).",1
77,5,"in the case of the USSR, the defence sector was given a high priority status within the planned economy, which meant that it benefited from the preferential allocation of scarce resources and from the establishment of special organisations (e.g. the Military–industrial Commission) to ensure the accomplishment of the national security objectives of the state. Aspects of Soviet defence organisation have been maintained in the Russian Federation (Davis, 2002).",1
77,6,"Government policy makers take into account external and domestic threats (military, economic, political) when developing a national security strategy that includes both threat reduction programmes (diplomatic, propaganda, arms control, espionage) and the military capabilities generated by the defence sector (Davis, 1986a, 1986b, 1992). i n the case of the USSR, the strategy of the Brezhnev regime placed heavy emphasis on military power, whereas the Gorbachev government shifted it to threat reduction (see quotation on p. 6). in the Russian Federation, the government of Yeltsin placed less emphasis on military power than has that of Putin.",1
77,7,"Economic warfare (including specific economic sanctions) is intended primarily to influence economic, technology and military power balances to the advantage of the country/alliance conducting it. Punitive measures can relate to trade in commodities (embargo, denial of ‘Most-Favoured Nation’ (MFN) status, refusal of export licences, preclusive buying) and finance (freezing of assets, restrictions on lending, expropriation of property) (Baldwin, 1985, p. 41). Even in periods with no overt economic warfare, countries that are leaders in technology maintain controls on exports that concern both the features of technologies (e.g. advanced encryption) and potential recipient countries (Joyner, 2006; Kabrt & Jung, 2015; MacDaniel, 1993; Rode & Jacobsen, 1985).",1
77,8,"in this article economic warfare (including sanctions) is interpreted as a politico-economic process with a beginning, an end, and the following features in between: EWF (Economic Warfare Feature) 1, trigger (cause); EWF 2, establishment of objectives (economic, military, political); EWF 3, agreement on conditions for termination; EWF 4, decisions on specific measures (e.g. restrictions on trade and finance); EWF 5, comprehensiveness of participation; EWF 6, commitment to implementation (e.g. rigorous or symbolic); EWF 7, effectiveness of counter-measures; EWF 8, evaluation of impacts; and EWF 9, removal of restrictions/sanctions. These nine features are discussed throughout the historical periods examined in the second section of this article, including the one related to the Ukraine conflict. Elements of this process (trigger, measures, counter-measures, economic impacts) are summarised in three historical tables covering Western economic warfare (sanctions) directed against the USSR/Russia during 1917–1945 (Table 6), 1949–1991 (Table 7) and 1992–2016 (Table 8). A more detailed assessment of anti-Russia sanctions related to the Ukraine conflict is presented in Table 10, which considers specific measures, goals and impacts (economic, military, political) during 2014–2016.",1
77,9,"The Soviet Union emerged victorious from World War ii, but its economy was severely damaged and its structure was distorted in favour of the military sector. By the mid-1950s it had reduced the military burden and entered a period of rapid extensive growth with rising living standards that continued into the mid-1970s (Davis, 1999, 2014a). The index of USSR industrial production (1970=100.0) increased from 22.2 in 1950 to a peak of 189.1 in 1988 (Figure 1). Despite Western economic warfare, the Soviet Union became the dominant economic power in Europe. Although the USSR introduced numerous economic reforms, it retained an inefficient shortage economy that was characterised by decelerating GDP growth and sluggish technological innovation (Ellman & Kontorovich, 1992; Gregory & Stuart, 2001).",1
77,10,"Soviet hard-currency trade through its state monopoly expanded dramatically in the 1970s because of increases in world market prices for energy and in exports of oil and gas: energy earnings rose from $388 million in 1970 to $18,865 million in 1984. The government made use of its evolving‘Rent Management System’(RMS) (HP 4) to redistribute the growing energy ‘rent’ (value) to finance imports, to support the defence effort, and to subsidise inefficient enterprises (HP 3) and East European countries (HP 5) (Davis, 2014a; Gaddy & ickes, 2005; Marrese & vanous, 1983).",1
77,11,"OECD economies grew at healthy rates during 1950–1973, experienced ‘stagflation’ in 1974–1980 due to oil price shocks, and then entered a period of sustained growth. Overall, from 1965 to 1985 Soviet economic power declined relative to the major OECD countries and the technology gap with the USA widened: 8–10 years for advanced microcircuits and 9–15 years for mainframe computers in the mid-1980s (DOD (US Department of Defense), 1988).",1
77,12,"From the mid-1960s the Soviet leadership pursued an ambitious strategy to enhance national security that placed greater emphasis on military power than on threat reduction (Davis, 1992, 2002; Sapir, 1991). The allocation of resources to the defence sector rose substantially and by the 1980s the defence burden was around 15% of GDP. The increases in the armed forces and deployed weapons are shown in Table 1. Western economic warfare (discussed in the next main section) slowed the emergence of the USSR as the second superpower, but did not prevent it (DOD, 1981 ... 1990).",1
77,13,"Russia and Ukraine emerged as independent states in 1991 with similar inheritances of a malfunctioning shortage economy with newly revealed negative value-added components (HP 3) and the common challenge of establishing a market system in difficult politico-economic circumstances. Due to the weakness of the state in Russia there was a break-down in the priority protection system and in central control of the RMS (HP 4), which had less rent (value) to distribute because of low energy prices ($22 per barrel). initial macroeconomic stabilisation efforts failed in both countries, which resulted in 40% declines in GDP and high inflation (EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development), 1994 ... 1999). Microeconomic processes were dominated by barter between firms, build-ups of informal inter-enterprise debt, pervasive second economy activity and corruption (HP 2), ineffective privatisation, limited industrial restructuring, and little FDi (see Note 10).",1
77,14,"vladimir Putin was elected President of Russia in 2000 and has remained the dominant leader since then. Despite slow progress with economic reforms in Russia, GDP grew by an average of 7% during 2000–2008 due to increases in earnings from energy exports (the oil price rose to a peak of $145 per barrel in 2008) and in consumption and investment. The greater resource rents available to the government through the RMS (HP 4) enabled it to support welfare programmes, subsidise negative-value added and loss-making industries (HP 3), and reduce domestic and international debt (Connolly, 2015a; Gaddy & ickes, 2010). However, the RMS continued to allow substantial informal siphoning off of rents and the second economy (HP 2), with its related corruption networks, remained an important component of the Russian economy (Kim & Kang, 2009). The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) caused temporary negative growth, but the population and economy in Russia were protected by stabilisation funds built up prudently by imposing high taxes on energy exports. During 2010–2013 GDP growth was a healthy 3.4%, inflation remained low, and surpluses were achieved in the state budget and current account (see Table 3 for 2012–2013). Russia’s high growth rates enabled it to reduce the economic power gap in Europe.",1
77,15,"With respect to macroeconomic performance, growth of GDP in Ukraine recovered to an average of 7% over 2000–2008, but then contracted by 15% in 2009. During 2010–2013 Ukraine had a low average growth rate of 2.4% (zero in 2013), chronic budget and current account deficits, and high foreign debt to GDP burdens (79% in 2013) (Table 3). Ukraine remained dependent on Russia for energy supplies and as a market for exports of uncompetitive industrial commodities (HP 5) (Gaddy & ickes, 2014a).",1
77,16,"The first question concerns the commitments of resources made by both the USSR and NATO countries to achieve their security objectives and establish a military balance in Europe. Due to the traumatic experiences of World War ii, NATO countries and the USSR were committed to converting economic power into military capabilities and to maintaining combat readiness. These policies resulted in the USSR devoting around 15% of GDP to defence in the mid-1980s and in the leading NATO countries accepting relatively heavy defence burdens for democracies in peacetime: USA 6%, UK 5%, France 4% and Germany 3%. Although these military efforts strained economies (especially that of the USSR) and entailed significant opportunity costs, they contributed to peace in Europe, stability of borders, and nuclear and conventional deterrence.",1
77,17,"The USSR economy was significantly smaller than those of its NATO adversaries and its technological level was lower. However, the Soviet Union developed a unique, insulated military economic system (central planning and rationing, high priority, technological espionage) that enabled it to mobilise its limited resources to become the dominant European industrial and military power (Figure 1, Table 2). However, the exceptionally heavy defence burden and well-known flaws in the general economic and political systems contributed to the collapse of the USSR. Most institutional features of the Soviet defence sector were carried over to the Russian Federation (Figure 2). However, in the 1990s the priority of the military–industrial complex declined and the armed forces, defence industry and military R&D experienced severe economic difficulties. The situation changed for the better in the 2000s as a result of economic recovery and the raised priority of national security programmes. As in the past, the top leadership is closely involved in managing the military–industrial complex (e.g. President Putin is head of both the Security Council and the State Commission for Military–Industrial Issues). The conflicts during 2013–2016 in Ukraine and Syria demonstrate that the Russian economy can generate necessary military capabilities and that the leadership has the will to employ them.",1
77,18,"Over the past century the dynamics of economic, technological and military balances have helped to explain the rise and fall of nations and alliances. This was evident in the case of World War ii. in the Cold War period the NATO countries had greater economic power and a higher average technological level than the USSR, but for several decades the latter was able to achieve military balance through its defence economic arrangements. in the post-communist period the NATO countries have maintained their economic power and technological superiority. However, as a result of continued NATO cuts in defence spending and the increased Russian defence effort the balance of deployed conventional military capabilities in Europe shifted in favour of Russia. Table 5 demonstrates that by 2013 Russia had overwhelming advantages over Ukraine in the local balance of economic and military power. These military imbalances contributed to Russia’s annexation of Crimea and support for insurgents in eastern Ukraine.",1
77,19,"The USA, Japan and European countries conducted economic warfare (supplemented by sanctions) against the USSR throughout 1917–1991 (Tables 6 and 7). However, there were recurrent disagreements between participants with respect to perceptions of triggers, objectives, termination conditions, and specific measures that limited the comprehensiveness of and commitments to economic warfare. The wide-ranging trade controls of CoCom achieved some successes. But the robust counter-measure Spetsinformatsiya system enabled the USSR to obtain controlled goods and secrets through trade diversion and technological espionage. Table 8 indicates that in the period 1992–2013 lower key and fragmented efforts were made by the West to control the flows of technology to Russia and to impose economic sanctions. These achieved some goals concerning specific products or sectors. Overall, the answer to question five is that Western economic warfare and sanctions directed at the USSR/Russia over the period 1917–2013 did not achieve intended ambitious objectives concerning the alteration of economic and military power balances, but did slow the development of the USSR into a superpower.",1
78,1,"Introducing a roundtable discussion of the World Bank’s World Development Report 2009: Reshaping Economic Geography, this article contextualizes the report in intellectual and political terms. It reflects on the lost opportunities for, and potential limits of, engagement between the style of New Economic Geography espoused by the World Bank and the pluralist heterodoxy of economic geography “proper,” before briefly previewing the commentaries from Gillian Hart, Victoria Lawson, and Andrés Rodríguez-Pose and the response from World Bank authors Uwe Deichmann, Indermit Gill, and Chor Ching Goh.ecge_1093",1
78,2,"This collection of commentaries represents an attempt to revisit some of the concerns that motivated the Boston roundtable, now that the full report has been circulated extensively and the wave of initial reactions has passed. Discounting the subdisciplinary pique that has (quite understandably, perhaps) accompanied the responses of many economic geographers, what should be made of the substantive arguments—concerning, for example, the relationship between urbanization and long-run economic development—contained in the report? Are the WDR 2009’s methods, and its policy messages, ultimately irreconcilable with the kinds of economic geography practiced by the (small but heterodox) field that has long self-identified with this moniker? Are conversations between (geographical) economists and (economic) geographers destined to remain dialogues of the deaf? Might there, nevertheless, be lessons for both “sides?”",1
78,3,"If, as it has been said, the World Bank “is to economic development theology what the papacy is to Catholicism, complete with yearly encyclicals” (Holland 1998, 4), then the arrival of any WDR is a momentous event. By definition, the WDRs engage with, and in many ways anoint, issues of global significance. Recent iterations have, for example, dealt with issues such as the role of the state, gender inequalities, climate change, poverty, transition economies, and environmental sustainability. And even if their diagnoses and policy messages cannot simplistically be assumed to represent a condensate of “World Bank thinking,” not least since the agency is hardly monolithic, the WDRs can be seen as strategically significant indications of this sprawling institution’s evolving worldview—and, in some instances, as statements of policymaking intent (see Wade 2001; Maringanti, Sheppard, and Zhang 2009). The positioning of “economic geography” in this exalted realm therefore calls attention, in a quite unprecedented way, to the spatialities of economic development, notwithstanding the ambivalent implications for the academic field formerly known as economic geography.",1
78,4,"In intellectual terms, the principal points of reference for the WDR 2009 derive from the New Economic Geography (NEG), a project that, with few exceptions, has had a rather troubled history with economic geography-proper (cf. Martin 1999), an attitude of indifference on one side being asymmetrically met by a mix of suspicion and antagonism on the other side. In substantive terms, the WDR 2009’s concern with urbanization as a global phenomenon marks the world-historical threshold, passed some time in the last decade, when the majority of the planet’s population was counted as formally “urban” (United Nations 2008); the social stresses and development challenges facing cities seem certain to multiply over the coming decades. Framed in these contexts, the WDR 2009 makes a bold case for the long-run efficiencies of trade-driven concentration-cumspecialization à la Krugman, embracing not only urbanization but also, more controversially, uneven spatial development as necessary facets of economic growth and poverty alleviation. Richly illustrated, with the benefit of the latest geocoded data and considerable cartographic ingenuity, the vocabulary of the WDR 2009 is essentially that of neoclassical economic geography (a.k.a. geographical economics or the NEG), while its confident voice resonates with the authority of cosmopolitan policy management.",1
78,5,"The catholicism of economic geography and development studies/geography, in contrast, is most certainly of the atheistic, small “c” variety. These two fields, which have evolved along parallel tracks for reasons that today seem indefensible, both tend to exhibit a rather unruly ethos of almost-unbounded heterodoxy—skeptical of paradigmatic claims emanating from just about any source, from Marxism to neoclassical economics. What passes as the center here has no more than a weak gravitational pull, around a fluid zone of engagement between, inter alia, institutional political economy, postcolonial theory, economic sociology and economic anthropology, (post)Marxism, socioeconomics, political ecology, feminism, and evolutionary and institutional economics. Here, economies and economic development are typically understood in expansive and integral terms, as socially and spatially constituted phenomena, and as sites of (often-contradictory) economic processes that are never found—and never travel—alone, but which exist only in institutionally regulated and culturally embedded forms.",1
78,6,"The nature of economic geography’s rather mutable heterodoxy has been rather difficult to characterize, even from the “inside” (see Clark 1998; Scott 2000; Peck 2000, 2005; Sheppard 2006; Lawson 2010). From the “outside,” Paul Krugman once expressed his indifference to (if not incomprehension of) economic geography-proper, as a field apparently preoccupied with “post-Fordism [and] the Derrida-influenced regulation school,” heaping faint praise on earlier traditions of work in geography for their “empirical insights, good stories and obvious practical importance,” but giving up on the new wave of “deconstructionist geography” (Krugman 1995, 41, 85; cf. Barnes 2003). If, indeed, there is anything that unifies the pluralist endeavor of economic geography today, it may be a rather antagonistic relationship with orthodox economics, although there are notable exceptions even to this general rule (see Clark, Feldman, and Gertler 2000; Wrigley and Overman 2010; Rodríguez-Pose 2010). The WDR 2009’s near-uniformly critical reception in economic geography and development studies must be understood, therefore, as less singularly negative (cf. Buckley and Buckley 2009) than “plurally negative.”",1
78,7,"This can be seen as a strategy, quite literally, of making the most of uneven development, on the grounds that in the longer-term economic benefits will “trickle out” from favored centers of growth to the progressively integrating periphery. As Allen Scott (2009) argues in his trenchant critique of the WDR 2009, uneven spatial development may indeed be inevitable, but that does not negate the case for active policy measures—not least because the political fallout in abandoned regions might destabilize the development process itself, never mind the social costs. His own work on agglomeration economies has convinced him, moreover, that regional institution building also has a vital role to play in shaping the character of development in growth regions. (The same might be said, moreover, about uneven spatial development, the intensity and form of which also vary with policy regimes.) Yet such considerations tend to fall outside the purview of the WDR 2009, due to what Scott portrays as its “blinkered vision.”",1
78,8,"While Harvey notes the curious neglect of classical theorists of agglomeration, like August L?sch, Johann Heinrich von Thünen, Alfred Weber, and Edgar Hoovermarginalized during the long aspatial turn of twentieth-century economics, prior to their recuperation under the NEG—Scott is equally perplexed about what he sees as an unnecessarily narrow-gauge reading of economics itself. (The WDR 2009, he notes, is largely silent on the economics of path dependency, cumulative causation, and on evolutionary and institutional economics and comparative political economy, not to mention regulation theory.) It would be quite wrong to characterize these responses as mere defenses of disciplinary turf or claims on academic naming rights. Economic geography effectively abandoned many of the questions reformulated under the NEG long ago, and its reengagement with agglomeration economics since the 1980s has been much more attentive to institutions and culture. New Intellectual allies, meanwhile, have been found across the broad terrain of heterodox economic studies.",1
78,9,"It is not just that economists and geographers appear to speak different languages. More fundamentally, at an ontological level, a Rostovian developmental teleology, together with the notion of long-term competitive convergence through the application of a pan-regional development fix, are difficult (if not impossible) to reconcile with some of the central axioms of contemporary geographical scholarship—namely, that economic development, national growth, and urban trajectories are spatially differentiated in qualitative form, not just contingent expression (see Peck and Theodore 2007; Bryceson, Gough, Rigg, and Agergaard 2009; Maringanti, Sheppard, and Zhang 2009; Hart 2010). The pluralization of economies in (economic and development) geography, then, is not just a poststructuralist tic; it speaks to an appreciation of geographically differentiated economic processes, of sociospatial embeddedness, and of both the reality and the still-to-be-realized potential of alternative economic pathways. Essentially unitary development visions—even their triptych reformulations in the WDR 2009 that acknowledges certain registers of spatial difference only to fold these back into a unidirectional development trajectory—cannot be reconciled with such plural views.",1
78,10,"Ultimately, it is this apparent irreconcilability of prevailing intellectual (and perhaps normative) worldviews that appears to be the principal reason for the exasperated tone that has characterized the WDR 2009’s reception in economic geography and development studies, where the majority of published reviews are concentrated. Economists, on the other hand, have reviewed the report more favorably, although not yet in any of their discipline’s mainline journals (Montgomery 2009; Buckley and Buckley 2009). Buckley and Buckley’s (2009, 2806) attempt to engage seriously with geographers’ critiques concedes some meaningful differences of emphasis and orientation, but rather baldly counters that “some of their criticisms are not valid.” There is perhaps a sense here that geographers, professionally inclined to sustain the contention that “things are different here,” need somehow to fall in line—along with skeptical governments—with what are often presented as encircling and superior forms of economic logic. “Growth, says the bank, is inevitably lumpy,” is how The Economist (“Lump Together and Like It” 2009, 65) tartly summarized the WDR 2009. “Governments must learn to like it.”",1
78,11,"In rather a different way, Gillian Hart (2010, 342) also seeks to tackle the WDR 2009 “on [its] own turf,” emphasizing its neglect of finance markets. She takes issue, too, with the adoption of a “linear” (Rostovian) model of economic development. Noting, like Harvey (2009), how the unanticipated, massive failure of global finance markets in 2008 was bound up with a radical remapping of the global economy (and international economic relationships), she goes on to rehearse the geopolitics of global finance in the post-Bretton Woods era. This geopolitical environment, she argues, has functioned to sustain the dominance of the U.S. dollar, while dividing developing nations between the debt-dependent (of Latin America and Africa, subject to neoliberal structural adjustment and lost decades of development) and those (Asian) countries that avoided the debt trap by running trade surpluses based on manufactured exports. Comparing China with South Africa, she argues that China’s state-led policies, including township and village enterprises, have underwritten higher real wages than have policies in South Africa, where apartheid was followed by structural adjustment. Whereas China has accumulated massive surpluses, providing insulation from global financial crises, South African firms and elites have moved their financial portfolios offshore into global financial centers. ",1
78,12,"Responding to what they characterize as three constructive critiques, Uwe Deichmann, Indermit Gill, and Chor Ching Goh (2010) of the World Bank reiterate what they see as the merits of the WDR 2009. Like Buckley and Buckley (2009), they argue that this is not simply a laissez-faire (or neoliberal) analysis, given its focus on policymaking. Retracing the policy road map of the WDR 2009, they document its positive reception among policymakers, summarizing the planned diffusion strategy—which, through a series of studies at the continental, national, and provincial scale, aspires to fine-tune the “reshaping economic geography” framework to a range of regional contexts. Geographers have been involved, they argue, from the “earliest stages” through to these regional case studies. The World Bank team responds briefly to the three commentaries. They dismiss Hart’s call for attention to finance on the grounds that finance markets have not malfunctioned in ways that have “impeded geographic transformations” (2010, 374). ",1
78,13,"What is to be made of this faltering conversation? Elsewhere, Barnes and Sheppard (2010) have issued a plea for a renewed commitment to “engaged pluralism” between geographers and economists, as well as across the community of economic geographers, calling for constructively critical engagements in which everything is potentially up for grabs, with all parties prepared to reexamine their most cherished, hard-core beliefs. The essays that follow indicate that such engagement may remain, for the time being, as difficult to realize as it is important—particularly given what Rodríguez-Pose calls the “Realpolitik power structures” (2010, 368) that empower economists’ interventions in comparison to those of geographers. We note, for example, conspicuous silences in the World Bank team’s response here: the persistent criticism of Rostovian developmental imaginaries goes unanswered, and their dismissal of the role of financial markets flies in the face of Hart’s summary of research purporting to demonstrate the opposite. There may be three speeds, but there is still only one direction; there may be three world-developmental zones, but each anticipates a higher stage of market integration.",1
76,20,"The response from the foreign trade sector exceeded even the expectations of optimists. Export earnings rose significantly and India became more integrated into the global economy, although its share of world exports remained low at 1%, compared to the early 1950s. While there are indications that export growth may have slowed in the latter part of 2007 and early 2008, merchandise export growth averaged over 20% annually from 2003-2004 to 2005-2006, which is the last year for which data is available. Additionally, service exports grew exceptionally quickly, more than doubling in each of the past three years. In 2005/06, India had a positive services balance proportional to 3% of its GDP.",0
76,21,"Some have questioned if the Indian IT services' achievement is due to government intervention and policies. However, it seems that the opposite is true. The IT industry grew rapidly without government support, mostly due to being a service industry that faced fewer government regulations at its inception. Furthermore, the IT sector relied less on Indian infrastructure than other industries, using satellite communications for product transmission between foreign buyers and Indian providers. The success of the Indian IT sector exceeded expectations and has increased economic optimism in India. Ultimately, the IT industry's crucial contribution to India's economic policies is the increase in confidence about India's economic capabilities.",0
76,22,"The momentum for reform has significantly decreased over the last three years. The crucial queries for the future are if this momentum will continue to stagnate, what are the growth possibilities, and what short to medium-term reforms are necessary to uphold or quicken the growth.",0
77,1,"The way conflicts in Europe, such as the ongoing one in Ukraine, have played out has been shaped by economic, technological, and military factors, which in turn have been impacted by economic warfare and sanctions. This article examines the relevant defence economic concepts related to the Ukraine conflict and draws on historical experiences in 20th century Europe to provide lessons on power balances, military capabilities, conventional deterrence, economic warfare, and countermeasures against sanctions. Additionally, the effects of economic sanctions on Russia and Ukraine between 2014 and 2016 are evaluated.",0
77,2,"The analysis comprises two interconnected parts that cover the years 1917-2016. The first one assesses the performance and organization of the defence sectors in Russia and the USSR, along with trends in defence capabilities, economic and military balances, and conventional deterrence in Europe. It also evaluates the resources supporting NATO and compares the military prowess and economic power of Russia and Ukraine between 2013 and 2016. The second part focuses on the reasons and characteristics of Western economic warfare against Russia and its responses to the same in 1917-1945, 1945-1991, and 1992-2013. Additionally, it discusses the impact of Western sanctions connected to the Ukraine conflict on Russia's economy, military, and politics. The introduction provides an overview of terms and ideas related to these two main sections.",0
77,3,"The economic power relevant to national security is determined by the GDP's volume and growth rate, sector level output's structure and flexibility, and capabilities in science and technology. Economic system governance through policies and functions within a multi-dimensional economic environment shapes economic power, with OECD/NATO countries having open market economies that generate macro and micro-level economic power. In contrast, the USSR/CMEA countries had centralised, state-owned, planned and closed economies that generated extensive economic growth but inhibited efficiency and technological progress. The collapse of command systems in Europe initiated economic transition processes. Countries in East Europe and the Baltic region made swift progress towards market economies and joined the EU. However, Russia, Ukraine and other former USSR states developed hybrid economic systems that performed poorly in the 1990s.",0
77,4,"Lenin and early Soviet defence economists made similar points which were also studied by major countries during World War II. They implemented varying policies in their war economies with different levels of success. Knorr argued in the post-war period that defense potential depends not only on economic power, but also on organisational ability and the share of GDP devoted to defence. Studies on economic power and security have continued up to the present.",0
77,5,"The planned economy of the USSR prioritized the defence sector, giving it access to scarce resources and special organizations like the Military-industrial Commission. These measures were taken to accomplish national security objectives of the state. Even in the Russian Federation, some aspects of the Soviet defence organization remain intact, as stated by Davis in 2002.",0
77,6,"Government policy makers take into consideration both external and domestic threats, such as military, economic, and political factors, when formulating a national security strategy. This strategy includes programs to reduce threats, such as diplomatic efforts, propaganda, arms control, and espionage, as well as military capabilities developed by the defence sector. While the Brezhnev regime in the USSR focused heavily on military power, the strategy shifted towards threat reduction under the Gorbachev government. Similarly, the government of Yeltsin in the Russian Federation placed less emphasis on military power compared to the current government under Putin. This is shown in a quotation on page 6.",0
77,7,"Economic warfare, which involves economic sanctions, is primarily used to influence the economic, technology, and military power balances in favor of the country or alliance conducting it. Punitive measures can include trade embargoes, limited access to trade benefits (MFN status), denial of export licenses, preclusive buying, freezing of assets, restrictions on lending, and expropriation of property. Even during times of peace, technology-leading countries control their technology exports by considering both the features of technologies (like advanced encryption) and potential recipient countries. (Joyner, 2006; Kabrt & Jung, 2015; MacDaniel, 1993; Rode & Jacobsen, 1985) (Baldwin, 1985, p. 41).",0
77,8,"The article defines economic warfare, including sanctions, as a politic-economic process with nine key features, including the trigger, establishment of objectives, and agreement on conditions for termination. These features are discussed throughout historical periods, including the Ukraine conflict, and are summarized in three tables covering Western economic warfare against USSR/Russia during 1917-1945, 1949-1991, and 1992-2016. Additionally, a more detailed assessment of anti-Russia sanctions related to the Ukraine conflict is presented in Table 10, which considers specific measures, goals, and impacts during 2014-2016.",0
77,9,"Following their victory in World War II, the Soviet Union's economy was left severely damaged and distorted towards military efforts. However, by the mid-1950s, they had reduced this burden and entered a period of rapid growth and increasing living standards that lasted into the mid-1970s. Industrial production saw a significant increase, with a peak of 189.1 in 1988. Despite economic warfare from the West, the Soviet Union became the dominant economic power in Europe. While some reforms were introduced, an inefficient shortage economy persisted, leading to decelerating GDP growth and limited technological innovation.",0
77,10,"In the 1970s, the Soviet state monopoly on hard-currency trade expanded due to increases in energy prices and exports of oil and gas, resulting in a rise in energy earnings from $388 million in 1970 to $18,865 million in 1984. To manage this growth, the government created the ‘Rent Management System’ (RMS), used to distribute the increasing energy value towards financing imports, supporting the defence effort, subsidising inefficient enterprises, and Eastern European countries. (Davis, 2014a; Gaddy & ickes, 2005; Marrese & vanous, 1983).",0
77,11,"During the period of 1950-1973, OECD economies experienced healthy growth rates, followed by a period of 'stagflation' due to oil price shocks that lasted from 1974 to 1980. Despite this setback, they then entered a phase of sustained growth. In the same period, Soviet economic power declined relative to OECD countries, and the technology gap with the USA continued to widen, with a gap of 8-10 years for advanced microcircuits and 9-15 years for mainframe computers in the mid-1980s according to the DOD (US Department of Defense), 1988.",0
77,12,"In the mid-1960s, the Soviet leadership prioritized military power over threat reduction as a means of enhancing national security, as stated by Davis (1992, 2002) and Sapir (1991). This strategy led to a significant rise in resources allocated towards the defense sector, with defense burden rising to around 15% of GDP by the 1980s. Table 1 displays the increases in armed forces and deployed weapons. Although Western economic warfare hindered the USSR's emergence as the second superpower, it did not completely prevent it, as reported by DOD (1981...1990).",0
77,13,"In 1991, both Russia and Ukraine faced the challenge of establishing a market system in a difficult politico-economic environment, as they inherited malfunctioning shortage economies with newly revealed negative value-added components. The weakness of the state in Russia led to a breakdown in the priority protection system and central control of the RMS. Initial macroeconomic stabilisation efforts failed in both countries, resulting in a 40% decline in GDP and high inflation. Microeconomic processes were dominated by barter between firms, informal inter-enterprise debt, second economy activity and corruption. The process of privatisation was ineffective, industrial restructuring was limited, and Foreign Direct Investment was minimal.",0
77,14,"Vladimir Putin has held the position of President of Russia since 2000 and has maintained his dominant leadership role. Although economic reforms have progressed slowly, Russia experienced an average GDP growth of 7% between 2000-2008 due to increased earnings from energy exports. The RMS allowed the government to support welfare programs, subsidize industries with negative value-added, and reduce domestic and international debts. However, informal siphoning of rents and corruption remained prevalent in the Russian economy. The Global Financial Crisis caused temporary negative growth, but stabilisation funds protected the population and economy. Between 2010-2013, GDP grew by 3.4%, inflation remained low, and surpluses were achieved in the state budget and current account, allowing Russia to narrow the economic power gap in Europe (Table 3).",0
77,15,"Ukraine's GDP grew at an average of 7% from 2000 to 2008 but declined by 15% in 2009. From 2010 to 2013, the country experienced a low average growth rate of 2.4% and faced chronic budget and current account deficits, along with a high foreign debt to GDP ratio of 79% in 2013. The country was reliant on Russia for energy supplies and exports of uncompetitive industrial goods, as noted by Gaddy and Ickes (2014a).",0
77,16,"The initial inquiry pertains to the resources that the USSR and NATO countries dedicated to securing their objectives and creating military equilibrium in Europe. After being scarred by the events of World War II, both the USSR and NATO countries committed to channelling their economic prowess into military capabilities and maintaining their readiness for combat. As a result, the USSR allocated roughly 15% of its GDP towards defence in the mid-1980s, whereas democratic NATO nations assumed relatively hefty defence responsibilities during peacetime - the USA (6%), the UK (5%), France (4%), and Germany (3%). Though these military endeavours strained economies (particularly the USSR), and incurred significant opportunity costs, they played a considerable role in establishing peace in Europe, border stability, and nuclear as well as conventional deterrence.",0
77,17,"The Soviet Union's economy was smaller and less technologically advanced than those of its NATO adversaries. However, it developed a military economic system that allowed it to allocate resources efficiently and become the dominant power in Europe. Despite flaws in the general economic and political systems, most institutional features of the Soviet defence sector were carried over to the Russian Federation. In the 1990s, the military-industrial complex experienced severe economic difficulties, but the situation improved in the 2000s as national security programmes became a higher priority. The top leadership, including President Putin, is closely involved in managing the military-industrial complex. Recent conflicts in Ukraine and Syria demonstrate the Russian economy's ability to generate necessary military capabilities and the leadership's willingness to use them.",0
77,18,"Nations and alliances have risen and fallen based on the dynamics of economic, technological and military balances in the past century. This is exemplified by the case of World War II and the Cold War period, where NATO countries had economic power and technological expertise while the USSR maintained military balance through defence economic arrangements. In the post-communist era, NATO countries still possess economic and technological superiority, but Russian defence efforts have caused a shift in the balance of deployed conventional military capabilities in Europe. By 2013, Russia had overwhelming advantages over Ukraine in both economic and military power, contributing to its annexation of Crimea and support for eastern Ukrainian insurgents. This information is demonstrated in Table 5.",0
77,19,"The USA, Japan, and European countries engaged in economic warfare against the USSR throughout 1917-1991, along with supplementary sanctions. However, disagreements between participants led to limited commitments to economic warfare. CoCom's trade controls yielded some successes, but the Spetsinformatsiya system allowed the USSR to obtain controlled goods and secrets through trade diversion and technological espionage. In 1992-2013, the West's efforts to control technology flows to Russia and impose economic sanctions were lower key and fragmented but did achieve specific goals. Overall, Western economic warfare and sanctions did not achieve their intended objectives concerning the alteration of economic and military power balances but slowed the USSR's development into a superpower. (Table 6 and 7 show the economic warfare, while Table 8 shows the efforts made in 1992-2013.)",0
78,1,"The article introduces a roundtable discussion on the World Bank's World Development Report 2009, which focuses on reshaping economic geography. The article discusses the intellectual and political context of the report, highlighting missed opportunities for engagement between the New Economic Geography supported by the World Bank and the pluralist heterodoxy of traditional economic geography. Gillian Hart, Victoria Lawson, and Andrés Rodríguez-Pose offer commentaries, while World Bank authors Uwe Deichmann, Indermit Gill, and Chor Ching Goh provide a response.",0
78,2,"This compilation of commentaries endeavors to re-examine some of the concerns that motivated the Boston roundtable, now that the complete report has been widely circulated and the initial reactions have subsided. Apart from the understandable subdisciplinary resentment exhibited by some economic geographers, what should we make of the significant arguments presented in the report regarding the correlation between urbanization and long-term economic progress? Is there a conflict between WDR 2009’s methodology, policy messages and the economic geography practiced by the (small yet heterodox) area that has long identified itself with this label? Shall the conversation between (geographical) economists and (economic) geographers forever be an unproductive exchange? Is it possible that both sides can learn something from each other?",0
78,3,"If the World Bank is the papacy of economic development theology, then a WDR is a significant event that deals with global issues. The WDRs have addressed topics such as the role of the state, gender inequality, climate change, poverty, transition economies, and environmental sustainability. While their ideas may not represent a uniform ""World Bank thinking,"" the WDRs reflect the evolving worldview of the institution and its policymaking intentions. The inclusion of ""economic geography"" in this realm highlights the spatialities of economic development, despite the mixed implications for the academic field of economic geography.",0
78,4,"The WDR 2009 is heavily influenced by the New Economic Geography (NEG), which has had a rocky relationship with traditional economic geography. The report emphasizes the importance of urbanization, a global trend that has accelerated in recent years, and the challenges it poses for social and economic development. The WDR 2009 argues that trade-driven concentration and specialization, as advocated by economist Paul Krugman, are necessary for long-term efficiency and poverty reduction, even if they lead to uneven geographical development. The report is richly illustrated and uses the vocabulary of neoclassical economic geography, while presenting itself as a cosmopolitan guide to policy management.",0
78,5,"The economic geography and development studies/geography of Catholicism is a small ""c"" atheistic version. These two fields have grown independently and exhibit a heterogeneous and skeptical attitude towards any paradigmatic claims, from Marxism to neoclassical economics. The center here has a weak pull, and the zone of interaction includes institutional political economy, postcolonial theory, economic sociology and anthropology, (post)Marxism, socioeconomics, political ecology, feminism, and institutional and evolutionary economics. Economies and economic development are conceived as socially and spatially-constituted phenomena and as sites of (contradictory) economic processes that are never isolated but rather, exist in institutionally-regulated and culturally-embedded forms.",0
78,6,"Economic geography's mutable heterodoxy has proven difficult to characterize even by those within the field. Paul Krugman expressed his apathy towards economic geography-proper, dismissing it as a preoccupation with ""post-Fordism [and] Derrida-influenced regulation school."" While there exists an antagonistic relationship between economic geography and orthodox economics, there are exceptions. The WDR 2009 faced a pluriform negative reception within economic geography and development studies.",0
78,7,"To take advantage of uneven development, a strategy may be implemented with the belief that long-term economic benefits will eventually spread from growth centers to the integrating periphery. While some argue that uneven spatial development may be inevitable, policy measures are still necessary to prevent the negative consequences and social costs in abandoned regions. Allen Scott's research on agglomeration economies highlights the importance of regional institution building in shaping development in growth regions. However, the WDR 2009 has been criticized for having a limited perspective on these considerations as it focuses solely on economic growth.",0
78,8,"The neglect of classical theorists of agglomeration, such as August L?sch, Johann Heinrich von Thünen, Alfred Weber, and Edgar Hoover, during the aspatial turn of twentieth-century economics is noted by Harvey, while Scott is perplexed by the narrow reading of economics. The WDR 2009, according to Scott, does not discuss the economics of path dependency, cumulative causation, or institutional economics and comparative political economy. These responses are not solely for the defense of academic naming rights or disciplinary turf. Economic geography has abandoned many of the questions addressed by the NEG, and its renewed engagement with agglomeration economics is more focused on culture and institutions. New intellectual allies have been found in the heterodox economic studies field.",0
78,9,"Economists and geographers have different language and ontological levels. The Rostovian developmental teleology, which focuses on long-term competitive convergence, is difficult to reconcile with the central axioms of contemporary geographical scholarship that emphasize spatial differentiation in economic development, national growth, and urban trajectories. The pluralization of economies in geography acknowledges different economic processes and alternative pathways, while unitary development visions cannot be reconciled with such plural views.",0
78,10,"The WDR 2009's reception in economic geography and development studies has been characterized by an exasperated tone due to the apparent irreconcilability of prevailing intellectual worldviews. The majority of published reviews are concentrated in these fields, while economists have reviewed the report more favorably, albeit not yet in any of their discipline's mainline journals. Some geographers have criticized the report, but Buckley and Buckley's attempt to engage with these critiques has led to a concession of differences while countering that some criticisms are not valid. There is a sense that geographers need to align themselves with encircling and superior forms of economic logic, despite their professional inclination to sustain the contention that ""things are different here."" The Economist has summarized the WDR 2009 by stating that growth is inevitably lumpy, and governments must learn to like it.",0
78,11,"Gillian Hart (2010, 342) takes a different approach by critiquing the neglect of finance markets in the WDR 2009 and the adoption of a ""linear"" model of economic development. Hart notes that the failure of global finance markets in 2008 was linked to the geopolitics of global finance in the post-Bretton Woods era, which has led to the dominance of the US dollar and divided developing nations. She compares China and South Africa's economic strategies, arguing that China's state-led policies have led to higher real wages and accumulated surpluses, while South African firms and elites have moved their portfolios offshore into global financial centers.",0
78,12,"Deichmann, Gill, and Goh (2010) from the World Bank have responded to three positive critiques of the WDR 2009 and defended its focus on policymaking rather than being a laissez-faire or neoliberal analysis. They emphasize the positive reception of the WDR 2009 among policymakers and its diffusion strategy to a range of regional contexts. The involvement of geographers in the framework from the earliest stages is also highlighted. The World Bank team dismisses Hart's argument on finance markets not impeding geographic transformations.",0
78,13,"The current conversation about engaged pluralism between geographers and economists, as called for by Barnes and Sheppard (2010), remains difficult to achieve due to power imbalances favoring economists, as pointed out by Rodríguez-Pose (2010). The essays in this collection reveal persistent differences between the two disciplines, with some critical points being left unanswered by economists. Despite the existence of different developmental zones, the ultimate direction seems to be a higher level of market integration.",0
67,1,"This article describes and analyzes the Réseau de Développement économique et d’Employabilité de la Francophonie Canadienne (RDéE), a large pan-Canadian network established to support economic development for Francophone minority communities in Canada.The study analyzes the organizational and relational structures of the organizations devoted to supporting minority economic development in Canada and compares their relative importance in different regional contexts. Finally, it discusses whether RDéE responds to economic necessities and whether it uses recognized economic practices and strategies, while considering the political context behind these initiatives.",1
67,2,"The subject of this article merits attention for three main reasons. First, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have received a large amount of political attention over the past two decades, especially because the government developed an increasing number of industrial and economic policies aimed at promoting and supporting SMEs. This requires a greater response from the government to support and help SMEs in their business activities, because SMEs often face barriers throughout their development or sometimes even lack the competences and resources needed to successfully carry out new business activities (Asheim, Isaksen, Nauwelaers, & T?dtling, 2003).",1
67,3,"Second, although some research has focused on SME support policies, few studies have compared public initiatives, programs, and organizations, and even less so the policies aimed specifically at Francophone minority communities in Canada. Studies that have dealt with French Canadian economic development and business programs are scarce and have mainly looked at the collective efforts to assist and ensure the economic development of Francophone minority communities (Forgues, 2007, 2008) or at their main social and cultural challenges (da Silva & Heller, 2009).",1
67,4,"This article is divided into four sections: We begin with some theoretical considerations about regional economic development, followed by a description of the Francophone minority communities in Canada. This provides a framework for the detailed description of Canadian economic development policies for Francophone communities. Second, we trace the context behind the emergence of Francophone minority programs in Canada and highlight some issues and events related to national unity and their effects on economic development policies. Third, we describe the organizational and relational structure of the economic development program addressed to Francophone communities and entrepreneurs, with a particular emphasis on the place of RDéE in each Canadian territory and province. We conclude with a discussion of critical issues surrounding RDéE in an attempt to explain the dichotomization between national unity objectives and economic development.",1
67,5,"The perspectives through which to understand regional economic development are very diverse. In general terms, the different kinds of local and regional development strategies have been articulated with the conceptualization of “highroad” and “low-road” strategies. The distinction between these potential routes to development relates to the qualitative dimensions of local and regional development (Malecki, 2007; Pyke, Rodriguez-Pose, & Tomaney, 2006). High-road strategies in regional development consider both structural change (i.e., adapting strategies toward the knowledge-based economy) with the imperative of lifestyles and amenities to attract and retain the creative workforce and knowledge industries to maintain and increase regional competitiveness. Low-road strategies in regional development are based on low wages, unskilled labor, low productivity, and low-valueadded activities.",1
67,6,"As economies become more unstable in the globalizing economy, regions need to adopt strategies to maintain or improve their position, regardless of their level of advancement or the sectors in which they specialize (Cooke, Heidenreich, & Braczyk, 2004). The same is true for the structures of governments and governance that are created and implemented and that affect, directly or not, economic development at the regional level. In general, regions aim for the “high road” rather than the “low road” in development, focusing on building the wealth of the region by enhancing prosperity, improving well-being, and increasing living standards.",1
67,7,"In the different strands of the current literature on regional development, there are five main areas of actions and interventions that emerge from the high-road strategy perspective in regional economic development (Amin, 1999; Malecki, 2007; Porter, 2003; Pyke et al., 2006). The first area of action is the promotion of economic development toward the building of regional clusters (Cooke, 2007; Huggins, 2008; Porter, 2003). It is now accepted that clusters can stimulate the competitiveness and productivity of enterprises as well as support the emergence of new spheres of activity. Successful clusters typically have strong, competitive businesses, appropriate research and education facilities, and supportive labor markets, infrastructure, and policy environments. It is recognized that, together, these features often lead to greater levels of competitiveness and productivity growth (Cumbers & MacKinnon, 2004; Wolfe & Gertler, 2004). Policy action is increasingly centered on supporting clusters or interrelated firms and supportive organizations. Policy makers see in cluster dynamics a new policy tool to promote regional development. In part, the perceived success of Silicon Valley and other clusters in Europe, such as Emilia-Romagna and Baden Württemberg, have encouraged national and local governments to develop their own clusters.",1
67,8,"Second, the experiences of some of the most dynamic regional economies in North America and Europe show the importance of building economies of association within regions (Cooke & Morgan, 1998). Knowledge transmission, production, and innovation occur within institutional, political, and social contexts (Cooke et al., 2004); these activities can be seen as embedded in social relationships. These social relationships develop over time along culturally determined lines. The regional context provides a set of rules, conventions, and norms that prescribe behavioral roles and shape expectations (Edquist, 2005). These rules can be seen as regional assets or as a specific form of capital that is derived from social relations, norms, values, and interaction within a community. The existence of social capital, with trust as an element of social capital, helps overcome market failures or reduce market costs for firms in densely related networks by supporting stable and reciprocal exchange relationships among them (Cooke, 2007; Lichtenstein & Lyons, 2006).",1
67,9,"Fourth, regional government bodies provide the central stimulus to regional economic development and tackle impediments to economic renewal. The idea is to develop what Scott (2007) calls the cognitive-cultural dimension of the regional economy and society. This approach indeed breaks with past policies, notably sectoral policies that disregarded the broader environment. Regions that fare best are those that have invested in their economic, social, cultural, and environmental development and favor the development of a regional economy and society by strengthening their institutional bases (Asheim & Gertler, 2005; Cooke et al., 2004). As such, regional governments have the role to maintain competitiveness in the region and deploy a multitude of strategies that will encourage processes of economic development (Polèse & Shearmur, 2006). With these intentions, governments create conditions favoring the development of the regional economy and normally define the formal institutional context in which economic activities are spread. Another important role of the government is to encourage common understanding and support collective practices and representations of economic development in the region (Amin & Thrift, 1994).",1
67,10,"Fifth, there is the promotion of economic initiatives toward the mobilization of diverse social groups and individuals to realize their potentials with the objectives of stimulating job creation and building a regional economy capable of nurturing skills, expertise, and capabilities (Amin, 1999). Targeted groups are vulnerable social groups such as young people, underqualified people, or ethnic and language minorities. Advocating the combination of economic competitiveness and social cohesion for social learning has been termed the new conventional wisdom (Cooke, 2007), especially in the context of regions marked with problems or persistent structural unemployment and weak levels of entrepreneurship.",1
67,11,"It is instructive to highlight how the development trajectories of regions differ from each other. Regions do not all have the same levels of development and complexity. Therefore, they do not experience the same problems or evolve in the same way or at the same rate (Doloreux & Dionne, 2008). Although every region aims for the high-road strategies in economic development, not all regions succeed. Large city regions would appear to be more suitable than smaller areas because of the numerous assets usually found therein, such as universities, a developed knowledge support system, and many innovative businesses (manufacturing and services), all of which enhance regional development and competitiveness (Wolfe & Gertler, 2004).",1
67,12,"To fully understand what Canadian economic policies and programs refer to when addressing linguistic minorities, it is essential to explore the definitions of Francophone and Francophone minority communities. Broadly speaking, according to the Canadian Census and Statistics Canada (2006), a Francophone is a person whose “mother tongue” is French and who is still able to speak French at the moment of the inquiry. The definition of Francophone also includes those who answer “French” to the question, “first official language spoken?” (a way of determining which immigrants are Francophones/Anglophones). Francophone minority communities refers to Francophone communities that are outside of Quebec and in a regional minority context. According to the Official Languages Act (Office of the Commissioner of the Official Languages, 1996), a Francophone minority community is officially recognized to be so when it has a minimum of 10% Francophones or at least 5,000 Francophones in urban areas.",1
67,13,"In total, Francophones outside Quebec account for about 3.2% of the Canadian population and are mainly concentrated in the provinces of Ontario and New Brunswick (see Table 1). These two provinces have adopted the most rigorous legislation related to service access in both official languages in Canada. Furthermore, New Brunswick is the only Canadian province that has chosen an official bilingual status, thereby offering access to services in both official languages. The Francophone population in the remaining provinces and territories varies between 0.5% (Newfoundland and Labrador) and 4.4% (Prince Edward Island); legislation regarding access to services in French is underdeveloped in these areas.",1
67,14,"Based on the reality of the two language groups and their disparities, it is surprising to note that little attention has been paid to the application of economic development initiatives and business or entrepreneurial programs tailored to specifically address language differences. The federal government had previously calculated that policies reinforcing institutional bilingualism would contribute to the development of official language minorities’ communities, but it became clearer in the mid-1990s that direct efforts were needed to more directly confront the risks posed to national unity and the economic disparities of linguistic groups. A consensus emerged that new linguistic economic development tools were needed more than traditional language measures. In 1997, the government created the National Centre of Economic Development and Employability; this Committee is at the origin of a complex web of organizations, partnerships, and programs designed to turn the Official Languages Act’s recommendations into policies to readdress the economic gap between linguistic communities. Thus, the economic aspect of language policies became more explicit and even evolved as independent policies.",1
67,15,"With respect to the organizational structure, RDéE adopts horizontal governing methods, using existing community networks to empower community actors while taking into account their specific needs and aspirations. Since its creation, RDéE has established numerous links with existing local Francophone associations for economic development. It has also created new structures or organizations where none already existed.",1
67,16,"The RDéE in each of the four Western provinces operates within the Western Canada Business Network; each Western provincial RDéE is thus accountable to WEDC. Therefore, unlike the other regions that we will examine below, the structure of Francophone economic development in Western Canada favors a top-down approach. In 2001, WEDC established partnerships between the Francophone communities and the four Western RDéEs to create the Francophone Economic Development Organization (FEDO) to achieve the objectives of the federal government’s social and language policies. WEDC formulates the policies for Francophone development in the four provinces through its FEDO program. FEDO’s governing boards are made up of volunteers who mainly come from the business community, which favors a transmission of knowledge regarding the specific economic challenges facing Francophone entrepreneurs. FEDO also provides a range of services exclusively targeting Francophone business development, which fall in three categories: and (a) provide consulting services, information, and training resources; (b) coordinate loans and grants; and (c) assist the economic development of Francophone communities with a wide range of services such as individual counseling; referral services; and assistance in enterprise planning, training services, workshops, forums, and conferences.",1
67,17,"The Business Development Program was designed to assist business start-ups, modernization, and expansion. Its main objectives include developing and valorizing entrepreneurship, increasing the number of new businesses, improving their competitiveness, and stimulating innovation and generating growth through product and market development. In 1995, this program officially became the main tool enabling ACOA to provide direct assistance for business development. Furthermore, the Cooperation Program joins the efforts of the federal and provincial governments, universities, research institutes, and private sector companies to strengthen Atlantic Canada’s economy. It is essentially through the Cooperation Program that ACOA contributes to the economic prosperity of communities in general as well as of French minority communities and Francophone entrepreneurs.",1
67,18,"In New Brunswick, two main organizations support Francophone entrepreneurship: the New Brunswick Economic Board and the Community Business Development Corporations. The New Brunswick Economic Board was given the mandate to create RDéE-New Brunswick and mainly offers economic workshops and promotes networking between businesses to stimulate Francophone entrepreneurship, whereas the Community Business Development Corporations produce studies to assist and support business strategies and projects. Community Business Development Corporations also contribute to the creation of new businesses and the expansion and modernization of already established enterprises and offer counseling services and assistance for entrepreneurial development, training, and technical assistance. Community Business Development Corporations do not exclusively provide services to Francophone entrepreneurs, but they help establish partnerships with other organizations addressing Francophones’ development and entrepreneurship projects, such as RDéE-New Brunswick and the New Brunswick Economic Board.",1
67,19,"In Nova Scotia, three organizations address Francophone economic development: the Economic Development Council, RDéE-Nova Scotia, and the Business and Entrepreneurship Support Center. The Economic Development Council is responsible for the other two organizations. The Economic Development Council was in charge of establishing RDéENova Scotia and is working for the improvement and economic well-being of the Acadian and Francophone population of Nova Scotia. More specifically, its mandate is to support economic development in targeted regions, mainly by promoting and supporting Francophone businesses. The Economic Development Council is directly funded by ACOA and thus acts as an intermediary between RDéE and ACOA. In parallel, RDéE-Nova Scotia is active in the promotion of economic development and has the mandate of providing the necessary tools to achieve diversification and economic growth. Last, the Business and Entrepreneurship Support Center offers services to entrepreneurs and has established a business support center in partnership with St. Anne University.",1
67,20,"In this study, we have analyzed the main organizations and initiatives supporting regional economic development in Canadian Francophone minority communities. We began by developing a theoretical framework to identify five main areas of intervention to support regional economic development. This framework highlighted the importance of adopting high-road strategies in regions to maintain and sustain regional competitiveness through different initiatives such as building clusters, developing social capital and relationships, coordinating economic activities, promoting regional governance, and, finally, integrating social economy. The empirical part of the article focused on RDéE, an organization that addresses the specific needs of Francophone minority communities in Canada.",1
67,21,"What follows are the key points of this article. On the positive side, RDéE aims at developing social capital and networks among Francophones in different minority communities. It is commendable for the Canadian government to make efforts so that its minority communities can prosper while preserving their cultures and using the language of their choice. But this study suggests that RDéE is perhaps more efficient or concerned with its underlying political functions than with its intended economic goals. RDéE promotes Canadian unity by showing that the government pays attention to its Francophone minority communities, but it is less clear whether its desire to palliate the economic disadvantage of Francophone minority communities is grounded in a clear understanding of their needs and the best measures to respond to them. Moreover, the way RDéE’s activities are designed and distributed across the country suggests that the organization has not fully considered how to adapt its activities to regional particularities and dynamics.",1
67,22,"Furthermore, we question why the four orientations should respond to the needs of the Francophone population in particular. Any gap or economic disadvantage experienced by the Francophone population that is explicitly attributable to the language variable should benefit from government intervention to make sure that the choice of living or doing business in French is not detrimental to development. Otherwise, it is reasonable to say that the best initiatives deployed for one language group should be similar to those deployed for the other. It is not clear why Francophones are especially in need of intervention in the four sectors. For example, if it is established that Francophones are underrepresented in the tourism industry because of communication issues linked to client demography, then the RDéE tourism orientation is justified if it addresses that deficit. In short, the government should make sure that being Francophone does not translate into an economic disadvantage and that Francophones have equal access to services, information, support, and economic opportunities.",1
67,23,"Our study also reveals the significant variation in the way RDéE has integrated existing structures in each territory. For example, WEDC has adopted a top-down approach and created the FEDO program that standardizes RDéE’s activities in the Western provinces. On the other hand, ACOA has favored a bottom-up approach, meaning that RDéE in the Atlantic provinces can address Francophone minority communities’ needs without having to comply with any of ACOA’s specific guidelines related to the Official Language Act. ACOA’s structure, which can be characterized as more horizontal, seems to conform more closely with the original mandate of RDéE, as the agency does not interfere with the activities of each provincial RDéE and Francophone organization. Furthermore, in Atlantic Canada, we witnessed a more complex network taking shape between ACOA, Francophone associations, and economic development organizations. This less standardized, relational strategy allows greater freedom and responsibilities to Francophone economic development organizations and the RDéE, although this also augments the risk of overlaps. A last example is FedNor, which targets specific regions and directs its activities exclusively toward rural and northern Ontario.",1
68,1,"Various international comparisons of subjective well-being show that the average level of happiness in a nation is significantly related to its political institutions. Examining a sample of industrialised market economics, this paper explores whether the same relationship holds for economic institutions as well. Holding other determinants of happiness constant, no significant relationships between happiness and type of economic system are found. Some conjectures explaining this asymmetry between happiness and economic and political systems are explored.",1
68,2,"Many studies on the determinants of happiness or subjective well-being (SWB) have explored the impact of particular demographic variables (sex, age, marital status, etc) and also of economic and political performance variables, such as unemployment status, inflation rates, efficiency of government services, civil liberties, and so on. Political and economic systems and the institutions composing them may be another source of SWB but, until recently, their impact has received relatively little attention. In recent years, however, Frey and his colleagues (eg, Frey and Stutzer, 2000, 2002; and Frey, 2008) have shown that SWB varies between Swiss cantons according to the degree of direct democracy; and Helliwell (2002) and Helliwell and Huang (2006) provide cross-country evidence that citizens are happier in nations with constitution establishing presidential systems and some form of proportional voting.",1
68,3,"The relation between economic systems and happiness has received virtually no serious theoretical or empirical analysis in the scholarly literature in any discipline. In the popular media one sometimes finds two types of vague arguments about this relationship: (a) Some leftwing commentators assert that happiness is greatest in ‘gentle’ welfare states, such as the Nordic nations, while it is lowest in English-speaking nations with their alleged ‘dog-eat-dog’ capitalism. Some rightwing commentators assert the opposite, that Nordic economic systems stifle initiative and frustrate would-be entrepreneurs, while lassez faire capitalism allows people to reach their greatest potential and, thus, become happier. (b) Others seem to say that most people are unmoved by abstract economic arguments and view the economic system instrumentally, that is, they are more concerned with the performance of the economy, rather than the system per se. As the economic performance of the four capitalist economic systems studied in this note are roughly similar by most criteria (Pryor, 2008), this argument can be taken to imply that there is no significant difference in happiness in countries with these different systems.",1
68,4,"This study is motivated by three concerns: (a) to explore empirically whether the relation found between the political system and happiness also holds for the economic system so that a stylised fact can be established, which can provide a focus on future theoretical economic analysis; (b) to determine which economic institutions are responsible for this relationship, assuming that such a correlation between system and happiness can be found; (c) and to test empirically the two ideological conjectures outlined in the previous paragraph",1
68,5,"The next section focuses on three methodological issues: the measurement of happiness, the selection of the sample, and the definition of the economic systems. The subsequent section surveys 53 possible determinants of happiness on a national level and explains why and how I have used principal component analysis to reduce these possible explanatory variables to a manageable number. The next following section presents the results of the regression analysis attempting to relate economic system to the level of happiness. The penultimate section explodes several objections to this type of analysis. The final section summarises the results and explores in greater detail why economic systems do not influence SWB, whereas political systems do.",1
68,6,"Hundreds of public opinion surveys pose questions of the following type to measure SWB or happiness (I use the terms interchangeably): All things considered, how happy would you say that you are on a scale from 0 through 10? Sometimes the question is asked in terms of life satisfaction, but the results are roughly the same (Veenhoven, 2000, esp. pp. 268–273). The results of these surveys have been standardised and summarised in the World Database of Happiness.",1
68,7,Several serious questions can be immediately raised about the meaningfulness of these tabulated answers: Are people telling the truth? Do the SWB scales yield comparable scores across individuals and societies? Are people’s answers consistent over time? Are international comparisons biased by cultural norms concerning the propriety of talking about one’s individual happiness? Such questions have been explored at considerable length in the literature on happiness; the general consensus is that in industrial nations the answers to these survey questions about SWB do reflect an important reality independent of cultural differences and the answers can be meaningfully compared from country to country.,1
68,8,"This leaves us with a group of 21 nations, all members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which, as shown below, have different economic systems. All are democracies and their political systems also have many features in common. Most also have relatively similar levels of economic development. Their similarities in the cultural and political dimensions give us more confidence that any discovered differences in their average levels of happiness do not arise from these causes. Although the sample is small, the use of a regression analysis with careful attention to statistical significance of the estimated coefficient means that we can have some confidence in the derived conclusions.",1
68,9,"An economic system can be defined as a set of complementary economic institutions and organisations that directly influence the allocation of resources. It differs from the political system because these institutions are primarily concerned with property relations or with the production and distribution of goods and services, rather than the exercise of political power. Of course, many economic institutions have important political elements, for example, government regulation, but a definition of the economic system focuses on how and to what degree such regulation influences resource allocation, whereas a definition of a political system deals with how the regulators are appointed and how they respond to the people’s will. Thus, definitions of economic and political systems may deal with the same phenomenon, but from different perspectives.",1
68,10,"Although many designate economic systems in terms of one or two institutions (eg, a welfare state), the approach taken in this essay is more comprehensive and takes into account 40 institutions, measured by quantitative indicators representing various institutions in the market for goods and services (eg, product market regulation or barriers to starting new businesses), the labour market (eg, coverage of collective bargaining agreements or protection of jobs), the production and business sector (eg, concentration of corporate ownership or shareholder rights), the government sector (eg, government’s share in total investment or share of employment in government owned enterprises), and the financial sector (eg, central bank independence or bank concentration).",1
68,11,"The 40 institutional variables were then subjected to a cluster analysis, a procedure that searches for complementarities between the defining characteristics (institutions) to determine which groups of countries feature roughly similar institutional configurations. Diagram 1 presents an example using just two, rather than 40, institutions. The axes A and B indicate the institutions used to define the economic system, for example, the ratio of government expenditures to the GDP and the degree to which wages are bargained at the national rather than the industrial level. The x’s define a country’s location in this two-dimensional institutional space and the spaces enclosed by the solid lines indicate the institutional clusters, which, in turn, define the three economic systems Q, R, and S (Figure 1).",1
68,12,"Using the 40 institutional variables, the actual systems derived by this method reveal four clusters: Anglo-Saxon, Nordic, Western European, and Southern European. Such a classification of the economic systems of the OECD nations is not startling, and other economists using different methods and criteria have arrived at a similar classification of OECD economic systems.",1
68,13,"As shown in Part B of Table 1, the average level of happiness does not vary greatly from one economic system to another. Indeed, only the Nordic and the Southern European nations are significantly different (at the 0.05 level of significance). If we follow the approach of Stevenson and Wolfers (2008) and add the logarithm of per capita GDP to the regression to hold constant this possible determinant, then none of the systems variable proves to be significantly related to the measure of happiness.",1
68,14,"The second problem arises because the number of possible determinants is considerably greater than the size of the sample. More specifically, among the various cross-national studies of happiness, there is no agreement about which are the most important determinants. In going through a wide swath of the literature, I found 53 likely determinants of SWB proposed by others that deserve examination, for instance, achievement motivation, belief in control versus fate, materialism, suicide, work values, subjective health ratings, fertility, inflation, and so on. This heterogeneous (and, at first sight, seemingly strange) list includes variables reflecting performance outcomes (social, economic, political, economic, or health) and cultural conditions and attitudes. None of these indicators, shown in Table 2 (and discussed in greater detail in Pryor, website), are included in the institutional variables defining the economic system. Obviously, for my sample of 21 nations these 53 possible determinants could not all be separately handled and statistically tested at the same time.",1
68,15,"A simple solution for both of the problems noted above is to reduce the number of possible determinants through a principal component analysis. This procedure isolates combinations of determinants that are highly correlated and, in the process, eliminates problems of multicollinearity among the possible independent variables. After the calculation of each component of the determinants of happiness, its impact is removed and a new principal component is calculated from the remaining data, so that the final result is a series of combined variables (principal components) that can be examined for their possible causal impact on the happiness variable.",1
68,16,"The data presented in Table 2 shows the correlation of the first three principal components with each of the 53 possible determinants, with the correlation coefficient indicating the relative importance of each determinant in the particular principal component. These components, each with an eigenvalue greater than 3.6, account for 54.1% of the total variance of the sample. Although interpretation of a single component is sometimes difficult, that is not important because each component represents the unifying element of the various possible determinants of happiness of which it is most significantly related.",1
68,17,"For the regressions including only one principal component and the economic system, the results are meager and primarily show a significant difference only between the Nordic and Southern European economic systems for the third components, holding the other determinants constant. When the three components are included with the three economic systems, none of the economic systems appears significantly different from the Nordic countries.",1
68,18,"The other explanatory variables are the various derived components of the possible causal variables. The key question to be answered is whether the individual economic systems have an impact on happiness, as measured by the calculated coefficient in the various regressions. The first three regressions show how happiness relates to each of the separate principal components and to dummy variables representing the different economic systems. The fourth regression includes all of the principal components and economic systems; and the last regression includes just the principal components and economic systems together.",1
68,19,"The regressions discussed above show that the economic system does not seem to have a significant impact on SWB of the population. Contrary to ideological assertions, the population in ‘gentle’ Nordic economic system and those in the ‘ferocious’ Anglo-Saxon economic systems show no significant difference in their average level of happiness, other factors held constant. However, two possible objections can be immediately raised.",1
68,20,"This can be easily tested by examining the correlation between the four individual economic systems and the three calculated components of the determinants of happiness. Eight of the 12 regressions show no significant relationships between economic system and a component of happiness. The Nordic and Southern European economic systems are, respectively, significantly positively and negatively related to the first principal component. The Anglo-Saxon and Nordic economic system are, respectively, significantly positively and negatively related to the second principal component. Such results suggest that in these cases, multicollinearity between the economic system and the principal component might have some impact on the results in Table 3 to reduce the relationship between happiness with the economic system and component variables in one third of the cases. This impact, however, appears minor.",1
68,21,"The second possible objection to the conclusion that the economic system has no impact on happiness concerns the determinants of the different economic systems. I have presented evidence elsewhere (Pryor, 2007) that individuals in countries with the same economic system have similar roughly economic beliefs and values, which are somewhat different from those in countries with other economic systems at the same level of economic development. If these underlying economic beliefs and values determining the systems are highly correlated with the economic values determining the three principal components of the determinants of happiness, then multicollinearity may underlie the lack of significant t-scores for the economic systems.",1
68,22,"First, the political system has a more immediate or visible impact on people’s lives than the economic system, which is more abstract. For instance, a referendum is an aspect of the political system of which people are directly aware. As the political system concerns the way decisions are made, the population can also more easily understand the system. In contrast, the economic system consists of many different and seemingly disparate institutions, so that the system as a whole comprised of these institutions are less apparent and people participating in the economy are not selfconsciously taking part in an economic system.",1
68,23,"Second, people may feel that they have little impact on changing the economic system than the political system, where they can vote for change. Their experience of voting and participating in activities to pressure the government for reform is more direct and focused than their experience with the economic system, where change is rarely linked to individuals and, moreover, is viewed as very much less possible except under revolutionary circumstances or during economic crises. In other words, happiness is more influenced by expectations of possible change, not when such expectations are habitually low: because the economic system is viewed as unalterable, people simply adapt to it and continue their lives. This parallels the result discussed in the happiness literature that paraplegics and others who have been seriously injured in accidents adapt in time to their new circumstances and have (in the long term, but not shortly after their misfortune) close to the same level of happiness as before.",1
69,1,"Based on the existing literature, this paper discusses the relationship between economic transition and corruption, and argues that economic transition is one of the main roots of the spread of corruption in transitional China. It divides economic transition into four parts, and examines various channels by which economic transition breeds corruption opportunities. By applying the case statistical analysis method to analyze 594 major corruption cases, it finds the most corruption-prone areas, and provides some empirical evidence on the existence of such channels.",1
69,2,"For thousands of years, corruption has remained a cancer in the human society. It exists in almost all countries, ancient or modern, developing or developed. In China, the rapid spread of corruption accompanied its great transition from a centrally planned economy system to a socialist market economy system. Corruption has not only threatened the economy development but also undermined social stability. What are the main causes of the spread of corruption in transitional China? What are the relations between the economic transition and the spread of corruption?",1
69,3,"At present, the internationally prevailing theory in interpreting the spread of corruption in a country is the ‘modernization theory’, developed by American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington. However, such a theory has found itself in a tight corner in explaining the corruption in Eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union during their transition periods. Based on the theory, some scholars have found how corruption in transitional China affects economic transition. However, it is a pity that few of these studies have provided any empirical results. That is just what this paper aims to do. This discussion can also help deepen Huntington’s theory, and attract more attention to institutional involvement in the fight against corruption in China.",1
69,4,"On the basis of observing corruption in the United States in the nineteenth century and in the UK in the eighteenth century, Samuel P. Huntington (1989) developed a theory which argued that modernization causes corruption. He holds that the level of corruption is associated with rapid social and economic modernization. He lists three channels by which modernization influences the level of corruption. First, modernization has changed the basic values of society. Second, modernization has opened up new sources of wealth and power, thus stimulating acts of corruption. Third, modernization, through changes caused by the output of the political system, has accelerated corruption.",1
69,5,"Huntington’s opinion is among the most popular theories to explain the change of the level of corruption in certain countries. The empirical research by Larrain and Tavares (2000) also shows that the higher the economic development level, the lower the level of corruption is. However, Huntington’s theory cannot explain the spread of corruption in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in their transition periods, as their economies were plunged into serious recessions in the period rather than experiencing modernization. In addition, some scholars have pointed out that a balanced social structure may help control corruption in a country (Benson 1990; Johnston 1995). Some others opine that if a country increases the average wage of its public sector or increases the possibility that corrupt activities will be discovered and punished, the level of corruption will reduce remarkably.",1
69,6,"From the early 1980s, some scholars began to focus on the economic transition and spread of corruption in transitional China, which had adopted a gradual transition strategy characterized by the dual-track system. Hao and Johnston (2006) pointed out that China’s reform had greatly increased opportunities and incentives for corruption. It was one of the main reasons for the surge of corruption in China’s economic reform era. Wu (1999) used the rent-seeking theory to analyze the rents and the corruption opportunities caused by the rents in the process of dualtrack reform, and pointed out that they were the root of official profiteering (guan dao). Gong (1994) argued that corruption in the 1980s was the inevitable result of the reform. Lu (2000) analyzed the corruption in the transition period and held that it was product of the reform of the administrative system. Some scholars also found an impact of institutional revolution in other countries’ experiences. Girling (1997) studied corruption in Thailand’s democratization in the 1950s, and showed that this process had created enormous opportunities for corruption. RoseAckerman (2000) and Kaufmann and Siegelbaum (1996) held that privatization provided public officials with enormous opportunities for rent-seeking, while Fisman and Gatti (2000) and Pei (2000) both opined that corruption was closely associated with decentralization.",1
69,7,"Economic transition in this paper refers to the institution evolving from the centrally planned economy to the market economy. After 1978, China experienced a process of economic reform first and followed by economic transition. Economic reform means an improvement of the pre-existing centrally planned economy system, and economic transition refers to the introduction of a new economic system intended to replace the old one. Economic reform is therefore different from economic transition. However, for ease, in this paper economic reform and economic transition are collectively referred to as economic transition.",1
69,8,"Corresponding to the five characters of the centrally planned economy system, this paper divides China’s economic transition into four areas: economic liberalization, decentralization, privatization and economic globalization. Economic liberalization refers to the steady rise in the market economy’s percentage of the whole economy and the gradual reduction of the government’s interference in economic activities (including deregulation of prices and opening of the market). Decentralization of power means the process of the central government’s empowering of local governments and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). It includes administrative decentralization and fiscal decentralization. Privatization points to the increase in the private sector compared with the entire economy. A number of private enterprises emerged and some SOEs and resources were privatized. Economic globalization refers to the growing economic interplay and internationalization, including the inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI), international trade and the cross-border exchange of personnel. The four parts constitute the main contents of China’s economic transition from 1978 to the present. The four parts, although not carried out simultaneously, were interconnected.",1
69,9,"Economic liberalization may breed corruption in two ways. First, in the dual-pricing reform, some public officials misused public power for rent-seeking. They moved the scarce resources in the centrally planned economy system to the market, and got huge and quick profits. Second, some public officials controlled the market entrance, and asked for bribery in the process of administrative approvals. They often colluded with the emerging economy entities (mainly private enterprises) and protected their illegal activities.",1
69,10,"Privatization may breed corruption in two ways. First, some businessmen had state-owned assets under-evaluated by offering bribes and then bought them at a low price. Second, private enterprises, which emerged and got rich in the economic transition, lacked political support and so tried to get protection by bribing officials. This increased the demand in the corruption market.",1
69,11,"Corruption, by its nature, is hidden and sensitive. We cannot ascertain what actually goes on. One of the main means for us to study corruption is to analyze those corruption cases that have been discovered and try to find out how corruption is generated. However, it is insufficient to focus only on the number of cases discovered or punished every year, because cases may differ a great deal even though they are discovered at the same time. If corruption activities in two cases occurred at different times, they may reflect different institution loopholes in different fields. Therefore, in order to explore the micro-mechanism by which corruption occurred, we need details of the corruption cases in order to discover their statistical characters. Only in this way can we grasp the orderliness of corruption. This paper therefore applies the corruption case statistical analysis method (Guo 2008) to study corruption in transitional China.",1
69,12,"Owing to the sensitive nature of corruption, no country would make all information regarding its corruption cases open to the public. China is no exception. Up to the present, we are unable to make more reliable, comprehensive or sample statistical analyses on all corruption cases discovered and punished during China’s transition period. What we can do, however, is to make a second-best choice: take the corruption cases published by official files, publications and media reports as objects of study and make a statistical analysis.",1
69,13,"Obviously, neither Database A nor Database B is perfect. Database A may be regarded as a scientific sampling of corruption cases involving senior officials, as cases covered therein basically include all corruption cases discovered and punished from 1978 involving senior officials.2 The inadequacies of Database A are its comparatively small quantity of samples and its vulnerability to influence by political power in investigating potentially corrupt senior officials. Cases in Database B are not selected randomly, nor does it cover all cases discovered and punished in China’s transition period involving middle level officials. But Database B has a relatively high number of samples, making analysis on the distribution of corruption-prone areas more persuasive. Furthermore, a comparison between these two databases can reveal differences in patterns of corruption by officials at different levels.",1
69,14,"Based on the two databases, we analyzed the types of corruption activities by public officials in accordance with the public interests involved. We identified five major types of causes of corruption, including administrative examination and approval, personnel management, administrative interference, government procurement and conflict of interests. Cases in the two databases are further divided into smaller categories according to their purposes, and the numbers of corruption cases by public officials in Database A and Database B are calculated, as shown in Table 2.",1
69,15,"As Table 2 shows corruption cases by public officials reveal that loan distribution and guarantee, personnel promotion and contracting out of construction projects are the most corruptionprone areas. This is consistent with our observation and what has been emphasized by the work of China’s anti-corruption authorities in recent years. Corruption in administrative examination and approval and conflict of interests are both associated with the economic activities that emerged after the beginning of China’s economic transition. The difference is that, in the former, public servants who abuse their public power to seek rent, do not directly participate in economic activities, while, in the latter, public servants run businesses personally or support their family members in running the businesses. In the conflict-of-interests situation, it seems that public servants themselves do not benefit directly from such activities, but there are severe conflicts of interests. Corruption in administrative interference has certain relations with government power and is one of the features left over from the planned economy system. In addition, its role in the generation of corruption has become even more prominent due to China’s decentralization of power. ",1
69,16,"This paper provides some empirical evidence on the relationship between economic transition and the spread of corruption in transitional China. It identifies several channels through which economic transition breeds opportunities for corruption, the corruption-prone areas and the institutional causes of corruption. It would be helpful for anticorruption practices in China. After recognizing the relationship between the economic transition and the spread of corruption, we may know better the current corruption situation in China and how we can fight it successfully.",1
67,1,"The article assesses the RDéE, a network established to assist the economic growth of Francophone minority communities throughout Canada. It evaluates the organizational and relational structures of organizations dedicated to minority economic development while examining their relative significance in various regional settings.  Additionally, the article explores whether the RDéE is attuned to economic necessities and if it implements recognized economic tactics and strategies, all while taking into account the political context influencing such initiatives.",0
67,2,"The article's focus warrants consideration for three primary justifications. Firstly, there has been a significant amount of political emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) during the last two decades. This is primarily due to the government's adoption of numerous industrial and economic policies that are intended to bolster and support SMEs. Because SMEs often experience hindrances throughout their growth process or lack the expertise and resources needed to undertake new business operations successfully, the government must respond more promptly to support and assist them in their business activities (Asheim, Isaksen, Nauwelaers, & T?dtling, 2003).",0
67,3,"Although SME support policies have been researched, there is a lack of studies that compare various public initiatives, programs, and organizations, particularly those aimed at Francophone minority communities in Canada. Previous studies focused on French Canadian economic development and business programs are rare and have primarily examined collective efforts to aid and promote the economic development of these communities (Forgues, 2007, 2008) or the primary social and cultural obstacles they confront (da Silva & Heller, 2009).",0
67,4,"The article is structured into four parts. The first part includes theoretical considerations about regional economic development, followed by a description of Francophone minority communities in Canada. The second part discusses the emergence of Francophone minority programs in Canada and their impact on economic development policies due to national unity issues. The third part describes the organizational structure of the economic development program aimed at Francophone communities and entrepreneurs, with emphasis on RDéE in each Canadian province and territory. Finally, the fourth section discusses critical issues surrounding RDéE and the dichotomy between national unity objectives and economic development.",0
67,5,"The understanding of regional economic development can be looked at from various perspectives. The approaches to local and regional development are often categorized as ""high-road"" and ""low-road"" strategies based on the quality of the development. High-road strategies focus on structural changes, such as adapting to the knowledge-based economy, as well as providing lifestyle amenities to attract and retain a creative workforce and knowledge-based industries to enhance regional competitiveness. In contrast, low-road strategies are based on utilizing low wages, unskilled labor, low productivity, and low-value added activities. (Malecki, 2007; Pyke, Rodriguez-Pose, & Tomaney, 2006).",0
67,6,"In the globalizing economy, as economies become more unstable, regions must adopt strategies to either maintain or improve their position, regardless of their level of advancement or sector specialization. This applies to the structures of governments and governance that impact economic development at the regional level. Generally, regions strive to take the ""high road"" in development, prioritizing enhancing prosperity, improving well-being, and increasing living standards to build the wealth of the region. (Cooke, Heidenreich, & Braczyk, 2004)",0
67,7,"In the realm of regional development literature, the high-road strategy perspective suggests five key areas of action and interventions (Amin, 1999; Malecki, 2007; Porter, 2003; Pyke et al., 2006). The first focus is on promoting economic development through regional cluster building, which is widely recognized to enhance competitiveness and productivity while creating new areas of activity (Cooke, 2007; Huggins, 2008; Porter, 2003). Successful clusters typically feature strong businesses, education and research facilities, supportive labor markets, infrastructure, and policy environments (Cumbers & MacKinnon, 2004; Wolfe & Gertler, 2004). As such, policymakers increasingly view clusters as a valuable tool for driving regional development, with inspiration drawn from well-known clusters like Silicon Valley, Emilia-Romagna, and Baden Württemberg.",0
67,8,"The significance of developing regional economies of association has been highlighted by the success of dynamic regional economies in North America and Europe. The transmission, production, and innovation of knowledge are all embedded in political, institutional, and social contexts and are reliant on social relationships that develop over time. Cultural determinants also play a role in shaping social relationships. Regional contexts provide a framework of conventions, norms, and rules that dictate behavioral roles and shape expectations. These behavioral rules contribute to regional assets or a specific form of capital that derives from social relations, norms, values, and interaction within a community. Social capital, with trust as a component, can overcome market failures or reduce market costs for firms in densely related networks. This is achieved by supporting stable and reciprocal exchange relationships within such networks.",0
67,9,"Regional government bodies play a vital role in promoting regional economic development and overcoming obstacles to economic growth. This involves developing the cognitive-cultural aspect of the regional economy and society, which is a departure from past sectoral policies. The most successful regions are those that invest in their economic, social, cultural, and environmental development and strengthen their institutional bases. Regional governments are responsible for maintaining competitiveness in the region and implementing various strategies to promote economic development. They also create favorable conditions for economic activities and encourage collective practices and representations of economic development in the region.",0
67,10,"The fifth strategy involves promoting economic initiatives that aim to mobilize diverse social groups to realize their potential. The objective is to stimulate job creation and build a regional economy capable of nurturing skills, expertise, and capabilities. This strategy focuses on vulnerable social groups, such as young people, underqualified individuals, and ethnic and language minorities. Combining economic competitiveness with social cohesion for social learning is now widely accepted as the new conventional wisdom, particularly in regions facing persistent structural unemployment and weak levels of entrepreneurship (Cooke, 2007) (Amin, 1999).",0
67,11,"It is important to note that regions have unique development trajectories, varying in both complexity and level. Consequently, they encounter distinct challenges and progress at different rates (Doloreux & Dionne, 2008). While all regions aim for high-road economic development strategies, success may not be universal. Larger city regions, which usually boast advanced knowledge support systems, universities, and innovative businesses in manufacturing and services, are generally more suitable for comprehensive regional development (Wolfe & Gertler, 2004).",0
67,12,"It is crucial to delve into the definitions of Francophone and Francophone minority communities to comprehend the Canadian economic policies and programs concerning linguistic minorities. As per the Canadian Census and Statistics Canada (2006), Francophone means a person whose primary language is French and can still speak French at the time of the survey. The definition also includes individuals who respond ""French"" to the question, ""first official language spoken?"" to determine whether immigrants are Francophones/Anglophones. Francophone minority communities denote Francophone communities located outside Quebec in a regional minority context. As per the Official Languages Act (Office of the Commissioner of the Official Languages, 1996), a community becomes an official Francophone minority when it comprises a minimum of 10% Francophones or at least 5,000 Francophones in urban areas.",0
67,13,"Francophone Canadians outside of Quebec make up approximately 3.2% of the total population and are primarily located in Ontario and New Brunswick. These two provinces have implemented the most stringent laws regarding language access for services, with New Brunswick being the only province to have official bilingual status. The percentage of Francophones in other provinces and territories ranges from 0.5% in Newfoundland and Labrador to 4.4% in Prince Edward Island. These regions have not yet developed comprehensive legislation concerning French language access for services. 

The revised paragraph provides the same information as the original but has been reworded to improve clarity and readability.",0
67,14,"It is surprising that little attention has been given to economic development initiatives and entrepreneurial programs that address language disparities between two language groups. While the federal government had previously focused on institutional bilingualism policies to support official language minorities, it became clear in the mid-1990s that more direct efforts were needed to address national unity and economic inequalities between linguistic groups. There was a consensus that new linguistic economic development tools were necessary to complement traditional language measures. To this end, the National Centre of Economic Development and Employability was created in 1997, leading to the creation of a vast network of organizations, partnerships, and programs aimed at readdressing the economic gap between linguistic communities. As a result, the economic aspect of language policies has become more explicit and has evolved as an independent policy.",0
67,15,"RDéE utilizes a horizontal governing approach in its organizational structure, leveraging community networks to empower community members and their unique needs and goals. From its inception, RDéE has collaborated with various local Francophone associations focused on economic development and even established new organizations where they were previously lacking.",0
67,16,"Unlike the other regions examined below, the structure of Francophone economic development in Western Canada follows a top-down approach. The RDéE in each of the four Western provinces operates within the Western Canada Business Network, and each provincial RDéE is accountable to WEDC. In 2001, WEDC formed partnerships with the Francophone communities and the four Western RDéEs to create the Francophone Economic Development Organization (FEDO) to achieve the objectives of the federal government’s social and language policies. FEDO's governing boards comprise mostly volunteers from the business community, who can provide knowledge on specific economic challenges facing Francophone entrepreneurs. WEDC creates the policies for Francophone development through its FEDO program, which offers a variety of services targeted at Francophone business development. These services fall into three categories: (a) consulting services, information, and training; (b) loan and grant coordination; and (c) a wide range of assistance for the economic development of Francophone communities, including individual counseling, referral services, and assistance with enterprise planning, training services, workshops, forums, and conferences.",0
67,17,"The aim of the Business Development Program is to help businesses that are starting up or looking to modernize and expand. Its goals are to develop entrepreneurship, improve competitiveness, and encourage innovation to drive growth in product and market development. Since 1995, this program has been the primary tool used by ACOA to provide direct support for business development. Additionally, the Cooperation Program brings together federal and provincial governments, universities, research institutions, and private companies to enhance the economy of Atlantic Canada. Through this program, ACOA contributes to the economic prosperity of both communities in general and French minority communities and Francophone entrepreneurs.",0
67,18,"The New Brunswick Economic Board and the Community Business Development Corporations are the two primary organizations supporting Francophone entrepreneurship in New Brunswick. The New Brunswick Economic Board focuses mainly on offering economic workshops and promoting networking between businesses to stimulate Francophone entrepreneurship. They created RDéE-New Brunswick to support this objective. On the other hand, the Community Business Development Corporations provide assistance and support for business strategies and projects by producing studies, contributing to the creation of new businesses, and offering counsel and assistance for entrepreneurial development, training, and technical assistance. Although they don't exclusively provide services to Francophone entrepreneurs, they establish partnerships with other organizations addressing Francophones' development and entrepreneurship projects, such as RDéE-New Brunswick and the New Brunswick Economic Board.",0
67,19,"In Nova Scotia, three entities focus on Francophone economic development: the Economic Development Council, RDéE-Nova Scotia, and the Business and Entrepreneurship Support Center. The Economic Development Council oversees the other two organizations, having founded RDéE-Nova Scotia and advocating for the financial stability and growth of the Acadian and Francophone population in Nova Scotia. Its purpose is to provide targeted regions with economic advancement by promoting and supporting Francophone enterprises. The Economic Development Council receives direct funding from ACOA and serves as a liaison between RDéE and ACOA. Furthermore, RDéE-Nova Scotia aims to promote economic development and equip individuals with tools for diversification and economic expansion. Finally, the Business and Entrepreneurship Support Center provides guidance to entrepreneurs and has joined forces with St. Anne University to establish a business support center.",0
67,20,"After creating a theoretical framework to identify key areas for regional economic development, we examined the organizations and initiatives that support Canadian Francophone minority communities. Our framework emphasized the need for high-road strategies, which can be adopted through initiatives such as building clusters, developing social capital, coordinating economic activities, promoting regional governance, and integrating social economy. Our research focused on RDéE, an organization that caters to the unique economic development requirements of Francophone minority communities in Canada.",0
67,21,"The following are the main points of this article. RDéE is aimed at developing social capital and networks among Francophones in different minority communities. The Canadian government's efforts to ensure minority communities' prosperity while preserving their cultures and language of choice are commendable. However, this study suggests that RDéE is more focused on its underlying political functions than its intended economic goals. RDéE promotes Canadian unity by paying attention to its Francophone minority communities, but it's uncertain whether it understands their needs regarding economic disadvantage and the appropriate response measures. Moreover, RDéE's activities are not adapted to regional differences and dynamics, indicating inadequate preparation.",0
67,22,"We question why the four orientations need to cater specifically to the needs of the Francophone population. If any economic disadvantage faced by the Francophone population is linked to language, the government should intervene to ensure that choosing to live or conduct business in French does not hinder development. If there is no clear reason why Francophones require specific initiatives, then actions deployed for one language group should be similar to those for others. The RDéE tourism orientation can be justified if it addresses any deficit where Francophones are underrepresented in the industry due to communication issues based on client demographics. In conclusion, the government should guarantee that being Francophone does not result in economic disadvantage, and Francophones have equal access to services, information, support, and economic opportunities.",0
67,23,"""The way in which RDéE has integrated existing structures varies significantly by territory, as shown by our study. Some territories, such as WEDC, have adopted a top-down approach with standardized programs, while ACOA has opted for a more bottom-up approach that allows for greater flexibility. ACOA's structure aligns more closely with RDéE's original mandate and avoids interference with provincial RDéE and Francophone organizations. In Atlantic Canada, a complex network has formed between ACOA, Francophone associations, and economic development organizations, which allows for greater freedom but also increases the risk of overlaps. FedNor, on the other hand, focuses exclusively on rural and northern Ontario.""",0
68,1,"Various international evaluations of individual happiness demonstrate a significant connection between a nation's political institutions and the average level of contentment. This paper analyzes a set of industrialized market economies to see if the same correlation can be found with economic institutions. After controlling for other influential factors on happiness, no noticeable relationship between the type of economic system and happiness is observed. Possible explanations for the disparity between happiness and economic and political systems are considered.",0
68,2,"The impact of demographic variables and economic and political performance variables on happiness or subjective well-being has been studied extensively. However, the influence of political and economic systems and their institutions on SWB has been neglected until recently. Frey and his colleagues discovered that SWB varies according to the degree of direct democracy in Swiss cantons, while Helliwell found that citizens are happier in nations with a constitution establishing presidential systems and some form of proportional voting.",0
68,3,"There has been little scholarly analysis on the relationship between economic systems and happiness. Two vague arguments are often presented in the media: left-wing commentators claim welfare states like the Nordic nations promote greater happiness, whereas right-wing commentators argue laissez-faire capitalism leads to the greatest potential and happiness. Some suggest that people view economic systems instrumentally and are more concerned with their performance than the system itself. However, the economic performance of capitalist systems studied in this note is similar, suggesting no significant difference in happiness among countries with different systems.",0
68,4,"The three main motivations of this study are to investigate whether the correlation between political system and happiness can also be applied to economic systems, in order to establish a general fact that can guide future theoretical economic analysis. Additionally, the study aims to identify which economic institutions are responsible for this relationship once it is established, and to experimentally test the two ideological conjectures discussed earlier in the article.",0
68,5,"The upcoming section addresses three methodological concerns, specifically the measurement of happiness, sample selection, and the definition of economic systems. After that, there is a survey of 53 potential determinants of happiness at a national level, which is reduced through principal component analysis to make it more manageable. The following section presents the outcomes of the regression analysis that aims to connect the economic system to the level of happiness. The second-to-last section addresses the objections to this type of analysis. Finally, the last section summarizes the results and delves further into why political systems have more of an impact on SWB than economic systems.",0
68,6,"Numerous surveys seeking public opinion utilize questions like the one below to assess SWB or happiness (I use both words interchangeably): Considering all factors, how content would you say you are, on a scale ranging from zero to ten? Although the query is occasionally phrased in terms of life satisfaction, the conclusions are essentially identical (Veenhoven, 2000, especially pages 268-273). The outcomes of these polls have been standardized and condensed in the World Database of Happiness.",0
68,7,"The tabulated answers regarding SWB raise several questions about their meaningfulness, including the honesty of respondents, comparability of scores across individuals and cultures, consistency of answers over time, and potential cultural biases. However, extensive research on happiness suggests that in industrial nations, the survey responses do reflect a significant reality independent of cultural variations, and can be compared meaningfully across different countries.",0
68,8,"After excluding four nations, we are left with 21 countries that are part of OECD and possess diverse economic systems. Despite the differences, all these nations are democratic and share many political traits. Furthermore, they have almost similar developmental status. This similarity in cultural and political aspects ensures that any variations in their happiness level are not caused by these factors. Even though the sample size is small, utilizing regression analysis with a focus on statistical significance of estimated coefficient supports the validity of derived conclusions.",0
68,9,"An economic system is a collection of interdependent organizations and institutions that directly impact resource allocation. Unlike a political system that emphasizes political power, economic institutions prioritize property relations and the production and distribution of goods and services. Although some economic organizations have political features, such as government regulation, defining an economic system focuses on how regulations influence resource allocation rather than how regulators are chosen or respond to popular demand. As a result, both economic and political systems may focus on the same issues, but from different perspectives.",0
68,10,"Although economic systems are often categorized based on only one or two institutions, this essay takes a more comprehensive approach by considering 40 different institutions. These institutions are measured using quantitative indicators that represent various aspects of the market for goods and services, the labor market, the production and business sector, the government sector, and the financial sector. Examples of these indicators include product market regulation, barriers to starting new businesses, coverage of collective bargaining agreements, protection of jobs, concentration of corporate ownership, shareholder rights, government's share in total investment, share of employment in government owned enterprises, central bank independence, and bank concentration.",0
68,11,"The cluster analysis involved 40 institutional variables to identify groups of countries with similar institutional configurations. Using a two-dimensional example in Diagram 1, the institutions of government expenditures to GDP ratio and national vs. industrial wage bargaining were plotted on the axes A and B. Each country was represented by an x, forming institutional clusters enclosed by solid lines that define the economic systems Q, R, and S (Figure 1).",0
68,12,"The utilization of 40 institutional variables resulted in the identification of four clusters of economic systems, which are Anglo-Saxon, Nordic, Western European, and Southern European. This classification of the OECD nations' economic systems is not surprising as other economists have also arrived at a similar classification using alternative methods and standards.",0
68,13,"The average level of happiness is fairly consistent across different economic systems, with only the Nordic and Southern European nations showing significant differences (at a 0.05 level of significance). When we control for the possible influence of per capita GDP by adding its logarithm to the regression, none of the systems variable is found to have a significant association with happiness.",0
68,14,"The sample size is considerably smaller than the number of potential determinants, leading to disagreement among cross-national studies on the most important factors affecting happiness. There are 53 potential determinants proposed by others that merit examination, including achievement motivation, materialism, and subjective health ratings among others. These indicators reflect performance outcomes and cultural conditions and attitudes. However, none of these are included in the institutional variables that define the economic system. With a sample size of 21 nations, it is impossible to examine and statistically test all 53 determinants at the same time.",0
68,15,"To address the issues mentioned earlier, one can use principal component analysis to reduce the number of potential determinants. This approach involves identifying combinations of determinants that are closely correlated, thereby eliminating multicollinearity problems. Each determinant's effect is calculated and removed, and a new principal component is calculated from the remaining data. The result is a set of combined variables (principal components) that can be analyzed for their potential causal impact on happiness.",0
68,16,"The correlation of the first three principal components with the 53 determinants is presented in Table 2, with each determinant's relative importance indicated by the correlation coefficient. These components have eigenvalues exceeding 3.6 and collectively explain 54.1% of the variance. Although understanding a single component can be challenging, their significance lies in their ability to unify the many determinants that contribute to happiness.",0
68,17,"The outcomes of the regressions with only one principal component and the economic system are unremarkable. They exhibit a notable variation between the Nordic and Southern European economic systems for the third component, keeping the other factors constant. However, when all three components and economic systems are considered, none of the economic systems seem significantly distinct from the Nordic nations.",0
68,18,"The possible causal variables have various derived components which serve as the other explanatory variables. It is important to determine whether happiness is affected by individual economic systems, which can be measured through the calculated coefficient in the multiple regressions. The first three regressions analyze the relationship between happiness and each of the principal components and dummy variables that represent different economic systems. The fourth and final regressions consider all the principal components and economic systems, or only the principal components and economic systems combined.",0
68,19,"Based on the previous discussions on regressions, it appears that the economic system has no notable influence on the SWB of the population. Despite certain beliefs, the happiness of the individuals in the Nordic's mild economic system demonstrates no significant difference from those residing in the fierce Anglo-Saxon economic system, with all other factors considered. Nevertheless, there may be two potential arguments against this finding.",0
68,20,"By examining the correlation between the four individual economic systems and the three calculated components of the determinants of happiness, it can be determined whether there are significant relationships. Out of the 12 regressions, eight show no significant relationships. The Nordic and Southern European economic systems are significantly positively and negatively related to the first principal component, respectively. Similarly, the Anglo-Saxon and Nordic economic systems are, respectively, significantly positively and negatively related to the second principal component. These results suggest that in these cases, multicollinearity between the economic system and the principal component might have some impact on the results in Table 3, which affects the relationship between happiness with the economic system and component variables in one third of the cases. However, this impact appears to be minor.",0
68,21,"The potential counterargument to the assertion that the economic system has no impact on happiness pertains to the factors that shape the various economic systems. In a previous study (Pryor, 2007), I provided evidence that people in countries with comparable economic systems hold similar economic values and beliefs, which differ to some degree from those in other countries with equivalent levels of economic development but different economic systems. If these underlying economic beliefs and values that govern the economic systems are closely associated with the economic values that drive the three primary factors influencing happiness, then multicollinearity could be the reason for the lack of significant t-scores for the economic systems.",0
68,22,"The impact of the political system on people's lives is more immediate and visible than that of the economic system, which is comparatively more abstract. A referendum, for example, is a direct aspect of the political system that people are well-aware of. The nature of the political system, which deals with decision-making, makes it easier for the population to comprehend. On the other hand, the economic system comprises diverse and apparently disparate institutions, so the whole system remains less discernible, and individuals participating in it may not be acutely aware of their involvement in an economic system.",0
68,23,"People may feel they have little impact on changing the economic system compared to the political system, where voting and participating in activities can pressure the government for reform. Change in the economic system is rarely linked to individuals and is often deemed impossible except during revolutionary circumstances or economic crises. Thus, expectations of possible change play a significant role in happiness, and when these expectations are habitually low, people simply adapt to the unalterable economic system. This aligns with the findings in the happiness literature that individuals who have experienced major accidents eventually adapt to their circumstances and have similar levels of happiness as before.",0
69,1,"Drawing upon the current literature, this article explores the correlation between economic transition and corruption, highlighting how economic transition is a key contributor to the proliferation of corruption in China's transitional economy. The paper dissects economic transition into four segments, scrutinizing diverse avenues through which corruption arises. Utilizing statistical analysis on 594 significant cases of corruption, it pinpoints sectors at the highest risk of corruption and reveals some concrete evidence substantiating the existence of these paths.",0
69,2,"Corruption has plagued human society for millennia and is present in almost every country, regardless of its level of development or antiquity. In China, corruption has grown rapidly alongside the country's transition from a centrally planned economy to a socialist market economy. This has not only hindered economic development but also undermined social stability. The underlying causes of corruption in transitional China and its relationship with economic transition must be examined.",0
69,3,"At present, the widely accepted theory for explaining the spread of corruption in a country is the 'modernization theory' by American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington. However, this theory has faced difficulties in explaining corruption in Eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union during the transition period. Although scholars have linked corruption in transitional China to economic transition, few have provided empirical results. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to provide empirical evidence and enhance Huntington's theory. The discussion could also raise awareness of institutional involvement in combating corruption in China.",0
69,4,"Samuel P. Huntington (1989) developed a theory which stated that modernization causes corruption, based on his observation of corruption in the United States in the nineteenth century and in the UK in the eighteenth century. According to his theory, the level of corruption is linked to rapid social and economic modernization. Huntington identified three ways in which modernization affects corruption: firstly, modernization leads to a change in societal values; secondly, it creates opportunities for wealth and power, which can incentivize corruption; and lastly, changes in the political system as a result of modernization can accelerate corruption.",0
69,5,"Huntington's theory is commonly cited as an explanation for fluctuations in corruption levels across countries. However, research by Larrain and Tavares in 2000 suggests that economic development is also a significant factor in reducing corruption. While Huntington's theory works well for many countries, it fails to account for the rise of corruption in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union during their economic downturns. Some scholars propose that a balanced social structure can help to control corruption, while others argue that increasing the wages of public officials or implementing stricter punishments for corruption may be effective solutions.",0
69,6,"In the early 1980s, scholars began focusing on corruption and economic transition in China. China had adopted a gradual transition strategy characterized by the dual-track system. Scholars like Hao and Johnston noted that this reform greatly increased corruption opportunities and incentives. Wu used rent-seeking theory to analyze the root causes of official profiteering, while Gong argued that corruption was inevitable in the reform era. Lu analyzed corruption in the transition period and attributed it to the administrative system reform. Other scholars like Girling, RoseAckerman, Kaufmann, Siegelbaum, Fisman, and Pei found impacts of institutional revolution in other countries' experiences, such as enormous opportunities for corruption during democratization, privatization, and decentralization.",0
69,7,"Economic transition, as used in this paper, pertains to the shift from a centrally planned economy to a market economy. China underwent economic reform before undergoing economic transition starting in 1978. The reform focused on improving the existing centrally planned economy, while the transition introduced a new economic system to replace the old one. Although economic reform and economic transition are distinct concepts, they are collectively referred to as economic transition for convenience in this paper.",0
69,8,"China's economic transition is divided into four areas - economic liberalization, decentralization, privatization, and economic globalization, with each area corresponding to one of the five characters of the centrally planned economy system. Economic liberalization involves reducing the government's interference in economic activities and the rise of market economy's percentage in the economy. Decentralization of power refers to the central government empowering local governments and state-owned enterprises, including administrative and fiscal decentralization. Privatization highlights the increase of private enterprises in the economy, and economic globalization encompasses the growing international economic interplay, including FDI, international trade, and personnel exchange. These four areas constitute the main contents of China's economic transition since 1978, and although not implemented simultaneously, they were interconnected.",0
69,9,"Economic liberalization has the potential to foster corruption in two manners. Firstly, during the dual-pricing reform, certain public officials abused their authority for rent-seeking purposes. They transferred limited resources from the centrally planned economy to the market, resulting in significant and immediate profits. Secondly, some officials controlled market entry and demanded bribes during administrative approval processes. They frequently collaborated with emerging economy participants (primarily private enterprises) to safeguard their illicit actions.",0
69,10,"Privatization has the potential to encourage corruption through two methods. Firstly, a few businessmen may have intentionally undervalued state-owned properties by offering bribes, and consequently purchased them at a low price. Next, private enterprises that prospered during the period of economic transition may have lacked political support and therefore, attempted to secure protection by bribing officials. This resulted in an increased demand for corruption.",0
69,11,"Corruption is a sensitive issue and often concealed, making it hard to determine the extent of the problem. To understand corruption, researchers typically analyze known cases and investigate how they were carried out. However, simply looking at the number of cases annually does not give a comprehensive view, since the circumstances leading to each case may be vastly different. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying corruption, researchers must delve into the details of each case and examine statistical patterns. Using such an approach, this paper examines corruption in transitional China by applying the corruption case statistical analysis method proposed by Guo in 2008.",0
69,12,"Due to the delicate nature of corruption, no nation would disclose all data related to its corruption cases to the public, and China is not an exception. As a result, a trustworthy, exhaustive, or representative statistical analysis of all corruption cases uncovered and penalized during China's reform period remains impossible at present. However, we can resort to a viable alternative, which is to utilize corruption cases that have been published by authorized documents, publications, and media reports as research subjects and conduct statistical analysis.'",0
69,13,"Both Database A and Database B have their own shortcomings. While Database A provides a scientific sample of corruption cases involving senior officials discovered and punished from 1978, it has limited samples and is susceptible to political influences. On the other hand, Database B does not cover all cases discovered and punished during China's transition period involving middle level officials and is not selected randomly. However, it has a higher number of samples which helps in analyzing the distribution of corruption-prone areas more convincingly. By comparing these two databases, we can identify the differences in corruption patterns between officials at different levels.",0
69,14,"After analyzing the two databases, we examined the public officials' corrupt activities based on the public interests they concerned. Our analysis led us to conclude that corruption was caused by administrative approval, personnel management, administrative meddling, government procurement, and conflicts of interests. We further categorized the cases in the databases into subtypes according to their intention, resulting in the calculation of the number of corruption cases involving public officials in Table 2 for both Database A and B.",0
69,15,"According to Table 2, corruption cases involving public officials commonly occur in the areas of loan distribution and guarantee, personnel promotion, and contracting out construction projects, which is consistent with the findings of China's anti-corruption authorities. Administrative examination and approval and conflict of interests are also associated with economic activities resulting from China's economic transition. However, the former involves public servants seeking rent through abuse of power without direct participation in economic activities, while the latter involves public servants personally running businesses or supporting their family members. Corruption in administrative interference is a remnant of the planned economy system and has become even more prevalent due to China's decentralization of power.",0

14,1,"The prognostic assessment of breast cancer is based on factors that determine a patient’s relapse risk, and together with predictive factors (e.g., estrogen-receptor status), it is used to make optimal therapeutic decisions regarding adjuvant systemic therapy [1]. Such decisions provide a balance between the potential benefit and associated costs and side effects of treatment [1]. Therefore, it is necessary to have sensitive and specific prognosticators to accurately define risk category for breast cancer.",1
14,2,"Currently, the most significant prognosticator for women with breast cancer is axillary lymph node status [1-4]. For node-positive patients, there is a direct relationship between the number of involved axillary nodes and the risk for distant recurrence [4]. However, despite the usefulness of lymph node status, recommendations for systemic adjuvant chemotherapy are not entirely straightforward. For example, five-year survival rates show that approximately 15% of all node-negative patients with larger tumor sizes (>1 cm) may benefit from systemic adjuvant therapy, but about 85% would survive without it [5]. Furthermore, approximately onethird of node-positive patients are free of recurrence after local-regional therapy [6-8].",1
14,3,"Other major prognostic risk factors, especially for node-negative patients, are tumor size and histological tumor grade [1-4,9,10]. For node-negative patients, tumor size is a powerful prognostic factor that is used routinely to make adjuvant treatment decisions [6,11], and tumor grade is primarily used to make decisions for cases in which the tumor sizes are borderline [1,2,5]. Although tumor grade has prognostic value, significant inter-observer variation in grading still exists [12-14]. as pathologists are assessing complex histological characteristics in a semi-quantitative manner.",1
14,4,"It is known that invasive breast cancer (a malignant neoplasm) demonstrates partial or complete lack of structural organization and functional coordination with surrounding normal tissue [15]. The idea central to this study is that this loss of structural organization and functional coordination manifests itself in the form of an increase in morphologic complexity of the epithelial components at the sub-cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular levels, and the degree of this complexity can be quantified and related to patient outcome. A method that lends itself particularly useful for quantitatively characterizing complex pathological structures at different scales, is based on fractal analysis [16,17]. In this study, we assess the prognostic value of a recently developed novel technique [18] to measure the fractal dimension of segmented histological structures of breast tissue microarray (TMA) cores stained with pan-cytokeratin to highlight the morphology of epithelial architecture.",1
14,5,"A total of 408 patients with primary invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast were selected retrospectively from the Calgary Regional Hospitals after appropriate ethics approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB). It should be noted that the IRB did not require patient consent for this study as it was a retrospective study in which many of the patients were deceased and the risk of exposing patient confidentiality was extremely low. Of these, 379 patients had at least one of three TMA cores that was sufficiently stained for fractal analysis. The age range of these patients at diagnosis was 34 to 95 with a mean and median age of 65 and 66, respectfully. Stage information was available for 375 of 379 patients with the following frequency distribution: 225 (60.0%) patients were Stage I, 99 (26.4%) were Stage II, and 51 (13.6%) were Stage III. All patients selected had received adjuvant tamoxifen treatment between 1988 and 2006. Cases were identified with Alberta Cancer Board records of patients who had received tamoxifen treatment without chemotherapy. In summary, the inclusion criterion was any patient who had adequate tissue for TMA construction, and had received adjuvant tamoxifen treatment but no adjuvant chemotherapy.",1
14,6,"Whole sections stained with Hemotoxylin and Eosin (H&E) were used to select tumor areas for the TMA cores. Fourteen breast TMA blocks containing an average of 94 tissue cores were constructed from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, previously untreated breast cancer tissue. To ensure there was no selection bias, three 0.6 mm cores were chosen randomly from cancerous areas of each donor block to construct the recipient TMA core block, and the Leica RM2235 microtome (Leica Microsystems Inc.) was used to cut 4 μm thick sections from each TMA donor block. In a previous study with prostate cancer specimens, we showed that fractal analyses of specimens stained with pan-cytokeratin provide greater classification performance (benign versus high grade) than serial sections of the same specimens stained with H&E [18]. The reason for this is that pan-cytokeratin isolates and highlights the morphology of epithelial components and excludes structures that do express pathological relevance in the form of morphologic complexity (i.e., connective tissue components). Hence, we stained all the TMA sections with pancytokeratin. This staining was performed using Ventana Benchmark LT. Protease 1 antigen retrieval was used followed by Ventana pre-diluted pan-cytokeratin (cat. No. 760-2135) antibody with an incubation time of 32 minutes.",1
14,7,"Microscopic images of the TMA cores were acquired with an AxioCam HR digital camera (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) mounted on an optical microscope (Zeiss Axioscope) at a magnification of 10 × objective. The AxioCam HR has pixels of size 6.7 μm × 6.7 μm, which are 1.06 μm × 1.06 μm in apparent size at the combined magnifications of 10 × objective and 0.63 × C-mount optical coupling (optical interface between the microscope and digital camera). The images were taken at the camera’s native resolution of 1300 × 1030 pixels, and saved in tagged image file format (tif).",1
14,8,"Unlike our intuitive notion of dimension (i.e., topological dimension), fractal dimension can be a non-integer value, and the greater the morphologic complexity of an object, the higher its fractal dimension relative to its topological dimension (Figure 1). Fractal dimension quantifies the level of structural complexity by assessing the variation in the level of detail in a structure as the structure is examined at different scales [19]. Hence, it lends itself naturally to characterizing irregular structures that maintain a constant level of complexity over a range of scales.",1
14,9,"In this study, we applied an automated fractal analysis technique we developed in previous work [18] to quantify the morphologic complexity of breast epithelium, a pathologically relevant histological feature. In summary, this technique involves the following steps:",1
14,10,"1. Application of a histological stain to tissue specimens in order to highlight and isolate the histological structures of interest. In this case, these structures include the outlines of the epithelial components comprising the multi-cellular structures (gland formations), cellular structures (individual cell shapes), and sub-cellular structures (distribution of keratin within the cells and nuclear shape).",1
14,11,"2. Image acquisition and background correction of stained specimens. The background correction was done by acquiring a “blank” image (under the same imaging conditions used to acquire the TMA images), and using this “blank” image to subtract the non-uniform background luminance [18]. The resulting background corrected images are converted to grey-scale (Figure 2).",1
14,12,3. Application of a series of intensity thresholds to convert the grey-scale version of the image specimen into a series of binary images from which histological morphology outlines are derived (Figure 2). Figure 3 shows a sample magnified region of Figure 2A to illustrate the segmented morphology outlines in more detail.,1
14,13,4. Application of the box counting method [19] (with appropriate spatial scale range - 10 to 50 μm) [20] to compute the fractal dimension of each outline image obtained from step 3.,1
14,14,5. Identification of the global maximum from a plot of fractal dimension versus intensity threshold. This maximum corresponds to the fractal dimension of the pathological morphology.,1
14,15,"In previous work, we showed that our method of finding the fractal dimension is independent of changes in microscope illumination setting or stain uniformity and intensity [18]. Also, it should be noted that fractal dimension is not affected by magnification as long as the field of view of the specimen image still contains the scale range of the structures of interest over which the fractal dimension was found to be constant.",1
14,16,"Our automated fractal analysis method was applied to a total of 1224 TMA cores (3 cores for each of the 408 patient samples). For each patient, the TMA core with the maximum fractal dimension was used for the statistical analysis in this study. The rationale for choosing the maximum fractal dimension from the sampled tissue cores is to reduce the possibility that the other TMA cores from a given patient contain only benign or more highly differentiated tissue. That is, it is expected that the TMA core with the maximum fractal dimension is representative of the malignant neoplasm that has deviated most from normal cellular/glandular breast morphology, and therefore it is the most probable indicator of abnormal and/or aggressive tumor growth with metastatic potential.",1
14,17,"For 379 of the 408 patients (92.9%), fractal dimension was successfully measured in at least one of the three TMA cores generated per patient, and it could not be determined for the remaining 29 patient specimens due to insufficient staining (i.e., less than half of the specimen being stained) or specimen folding. Eight of the 29 patients could not be assessed because all 3 of their TMA cores resulted in a “blank” slide. The breakdown of the number of patients for which the TMA cores were sufficiently stained for fractal analysis was as follows: 36 patients (9.5%) had one evaluable core, 105 patients (27.7%) had two evaluable cores, and 238 patients (62.8%) had three evaluable cores.",1
14,18,"For purposes of analyses, it is often useful to convert a measured variable to a categorical variable so as to place patients into graded risk strata. As the particular fractal analysis technique we developed is novel, there are no established cutpoints available. Although several methods exist to determine cutpoints, namely biological determination, data-oriented, and outcome-oriented, there is no single method or criterion to specify which approach is best. For the present analyses, we used a data-oriented approach to select two cutpoints. The first cutpoint was chosen to correspond to the upper quartile (75th percentile) of the fractal dimension data, and the second cutpoint was chosen as the median of the remaining lower threequarters of the data. Two cutpoints, rather than one, were chosen to assess whether there was a graded relationship between fractal dimension and patient prognosis.",1
14,19,Associations between categorized fractal dimension scores and clinicopathological variables were assessed for statistical significance using a chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate 10-year disease-specific and overall survival rates and the logrank test was used to compare the curves for statistical significance. Disease-specific survival was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of death from cancer or date of last follow-up. Overall survival was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of death from any cause or date of last follow-up. The above analyses were repeated using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling to assess whether any of the clinicopathological variables influenced the findings. The proportionality assumption was assessed for all covariates using Log-Minus-Log Survival Plots and none violated the assumption. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute Inc).,1
14,20,"The prognostic accuracy of fractal dimension in predicting death from breast cancer and death from any cause was quantified by the area under the curve (AUC) from a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Values of AUC range from 0.5 (chance accuracy) to 1.0 (perfect accuracy), with the following intermediate benchmarks: 0.6 (fair), 0.7 (good), 0.8 (excellent), and 0.9 (almost perfect). For the analysis, the predicted probability of outcome from a Cox regression model was considered as a continuum. The actual occurrence of outcome was used as the comparative standard.",1
14,21,"A split-sample cross-validation was performed to assess the generalizability of the results [21]. The process consisted of splitting the original sample of 379 patients into a training set of 190 patients and a validation set of 189 patients using random sampling. A regression equation was derived in the training set and the AUC between the observed and predicted response values was calculated. The regression coefficients from the training set were then used to calculate predicted values in the validation set. The AUC between these predicted values and observed values in the validation set was calculated, and is called the cross-validation coefficient. The shrinkage coefficient was calculated as the difference between the AUCs of the training and validation sets. The smaller the shrinkage coefficient, the more confidence one can have in the generalizability of the results. Although there are no clear guidelines regarding the magnitude of shrinkage, except that smaller is better, values less than 0.10 indicate a generalizable model. Given a satisfactory shrinkage coefficient, the data were combined from both sets and a final regression equation was derived based upon the entire sample.",1
14,22,"Out of 379 evaluable patients, several had missing data: 15 (9.0%) tumor grades, 4 (1.1%) lymph node status, 15 (4.0%) estrogen-receptor status, and 12 (3.2%) HER-2/neu status. Rather than excluding these patients from the analyses and reducing the sample size, missing data were imputed using the predicted mean approach in SOLAS 3.0 software (Statistical Solutions, Ltd.). Imputation bias was assessed by re-running all the analyses and excluding any patient with missing data. As the estimates were similar, the results are reported with the imputed data.",1
14,23,"Fractal dimension scores ranged from 1.08 to 1.97, with a median of 1.62, lower quartile 1.49, and upper quartile 1.75. There was moderate level of relatedness (intraclass correlation = 0.51) among the cores. Using the data-oriented approach to select two cutpoints, fractal dimension values < 1.56 were considered low (N = 141), 1.56-1.75 as intermediate (N = 148), and > 1.75 as high (N = 90). Figure 2 shows representative TMA cores from these fractal dimension categories. One can see from this figure that the classification of TMA cores into low, intermediate, and high fractal dimension categories (A-C) corresponds to the increasing complexity of outline morphology.",1
14,24,"The baseline patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Higher fractal dimension was significantly associated with traditional indicators of poor prognosis, including older age, larger tumour sizes, higher tumour grade, and positive lymph node status. However, fractal dimension was not associated with either estrogenreceptor status or HER-2/neu status.",1
14,25,"The median patient follow-up was 5.2 years. The 10-year disease-specific and overall survival rates for the entire group of 379 patients were 52.5% and 42.5%, respectively. Patients with higher fractal scores had significantly worse disease-specific survival than those with lower scores (25.0% versus 56.4% versus 69.4%, p < 0.001; Table 2 and Figure 4A). As well, patients with higher scores had significantly worse overall survival (14.2% versus 39.9% versus 67.4%, p < 0.001; Table 2 and Figure 4B). The AUCs for fractal dimension were 0.66 and 0.67 for univariate disease-specific and overall survival, respectively, indicating good levels of prognostic accuracy. As expected, older age, higher grade, and positive lymph node status were significantly predictive of worse outcome, but not the size of the tumour, estrogen-receptor status, or HER-2/neu status (Table 2).",1
14,26,"Tumour grade was derived from the original pathology reports that included between 10 and 30 board-certified cancer pathologists. In contrast to the distinct separation of the disease-specific survival curves for the different fractal dimension categories (Figure 4A), the disease-specific survival curves for grade 1 and 2 tumours virtually overlaped each other over the entire 10-year follow-up period (Figure 4C). Also, there is virtual overlap in the overall survival curves of tumour grades 1 and 2 for the first 4-year period (Figure 4D). These results suggest that tumour grades 1 and 2 do not discriminate patients with respect to 10-year outcome.",1
14,27,"Results from Cox proportional hazards regression showed that fractal dimension remained statistically significant even after adjusting for all clinicopathological variables (Table 3). This result implies that fractal dimension is a strong prognostic factor, even though the multivariate hazard ratio (Table 3) is smaller than the univariate hazard ratio (Table 2). The AUCs for the 7factor regression models were 0.73 and 0.75 for diseasespecific and overall survival, respectively. These AUCs increased by only 0.07 and 0.08 when six clinical-pathological factors were added to fractal dimension in the multivariate regression model. The small increase in AUCs incidate that the other clinical-pathological factors contribute little to the prognostic accuracy beyond fractal dimension. It is also worth noting that even with the comparison of grades 1 and 2 as one category versus grade 3 tumours, both disease-specific and overall survival were more strongly and significantly associated with fractal dimension than tumour grade.",1
14,28,"The generalizability of the aforementioned results was assessed by split-sample cross-validation as described in the statistical analysis section. The results, shown in Table 4 are congruent, not only with each set but also with the results of the entire sample shown in Tables 2 and 3. Specifically, the frequency distribution of low, moderate, and high fractal dimension is similar, as are the 10-year disease-specific and overall survival rates in these three categories. Even with smaller sample sizes, both the training and validation sets still show a pattern of doubling of hazards with higher levels of fractal dimension. The shrinkage coefficients for disease-specific and overall survival were -0.01 and -0.05, respectively, both indicating that fractal dimension is generalizable and that combining data from both sets in the analyses was justified.",1
14,29,"We previously developed a fractal analysis method to quantitatively measure the morphologic complexity of epithelial architecture [18], and showed a direct association between fractal dimension and breast tumour grade, suggesting that it may be a good surrogate measure of tumour differentiation [22]. In this study we examined the prognostic value of fractal dimension by analyzing 379 specimens from patients with invasive breast cancer, and found that with the exception of nodal status, fractal dimension showed a stronger association with disease-specific survival than standard clinical prognosticators. The potential clinical implications of these results are substantial because to our knowledge, this is the largest and only study of its kind investigating and demonstrating a positive association between the morphologic complexity of breast epithelial architecture (via the fractal dimension metric) and patient outcome. The potential advantages of fractal dimension over conventional tumour grading is that it is a quantitative and reproducible indicator that would be able to provide pathologists with rapid and cost effective high volume analysis from as few as three tissue microarray (TMA) cores per patient.",1
14,30,"Ideally, a study investigating the value of a potential prognosticator should only involve patients that have not received any form of adjuvant systemic therapy. However, as noted by Mirza et al. [5], such studies are becoming increasingly difficult to perform because systemic therapy is recommended for an ever-widening range of breast cancer patients. Although none of the patients in this study were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, they were all treated with adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, including the 24 ER-negative patients (note: cases selected for this study where from as far back as 1988 when tamoxifen was occasionally administered to patients with ER-negative tumours). However, even though the patients received a form of adjuvant systemic therapy, the same form of treatment was received by all of the patients leading to the expectation that fractal dimension will be independent of the predictive factor related to tamoxifen therapy (i. e., ER-positive status). Indeed, this appears to be the case, since approximately the same percentage of ERpositive patients are in the low, intermediate, and high fractal dimension groups (Table 1), which likely indicates that tamoxifen therapy has put all of these ERpositive patients on an equal footing.",1
14,31,"Previous studies have examined the application of fractal analysis for characterizing cancer [23,24] and have shown that fractal dimension can describe the complex pathological structures seen in some cancers; [18,22] however, to our knowledge, our results represent the largest and sole study relating fractal dimension of epithelial architecture to patient outcome. Although we did not use an external patient validation set in this proof of principle study, we employed a data-oriented approach to minimize bias in the selection of cutpoints, as well as, conducting a split-sample cross-validation analysis. This analysis suggests that the results are generalizable, whereby higher fractal dimensions are associated with poorer outcome. This observation demonstrates the high potential of fractal dimension as an image-based prognostic marker, and it is congruent with the notion that malignant breast neoplasms associated with poorer outcome demonstrate partial or complete lack of structural organization and functional coordination with surrounding normal tissue [15]. Furthermore, it implies that changes in the morphologic complexity of architectural components of the neoplasm (i.e., the epithelium) that arise from changes in the functional status of cells in malignant neoplasms can be quantified with fractal analysis.",1
14,32,"In summary, the results of this retrospective study show that fractal dimension is a promising image analysis marker for the prognosis of IDC of the breast. However, its’ prognostic value needs to be confirmed in external validation studies, and ultimately in the context of controlled prospective clinical trials. As a step in this direction, in future work, we will investigate the prognostic value of fractal dimension for defining risk category for Stage I (i.e., lymph node-negative and tumour size ≤ 2 cm in maximum diameter), IDC, ER-positive breast cancer patients that have not received any form of adjuvant systemic therapy. Such a study would be especially valuable because in current clinical practice it is still difficult to identify this subgroup of patients that would benefit most from adjuvant chemotherapy. Also, in future work we will investigate the prognostic and predictive value of combining fractal dimension, a morphological index, with a quantitative analysis of mitotic count, which is a cellular proliferation index that has been shown to be a significant prognostic indicator for node-negative breast cancer [5]. These investigations would provide validation of the significance of morphologic complexity of epithelial architecture in node-negative breast cancer, and explore the possible synergy between morphologic complexity and cellular proliferation.",1
16,1,"Tooth loss, one of the indicators of periodontal disease [1,2], has been reported to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia [3,4]. Individuals with clinical dementia have an increased deterioration of their dental health [5], and tooth loss may induce nutritional deficits [6]. Reductions in the number of pyramidal cells [7] and acetylcholine levels [8] in the hippocampus due to the decrease of masticatory function caused by molar loss have been found in animal models. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized [9] that periodontal disease-derived inflammatory molecules, bacteria, and bacterial products enhance brain inflammation [10,11].",1
16,2,"Among individuals with mild memory impairment (MMI), 21.2% progressed to illnesses with dementia, including AD (10.6%), vascular dementia (4.8%), or other types of dementia (5.8%), over a period of 5 years [12]; therefore, they represent a high-risk population for dementia. MMI was defined as [13]: (1) no impairment of the activities of daily living (ADL); (2) normal general cognitive function, as determined by a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≥ 24 [14]; (3) objective memory impairment, assessed by the MMSE three-word delayed recall test (Recall test) (low score: 1 or 0); and (4) absence of dementia or depression, diagnosed by geriatric neuropsychiatrists according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3 rd edn., revised (DSM-III R) criteria [15].",1
16,3,"We hypothesized that tooth loss may also be associated with the preclinical stage of AD and dementia. To investigate our hypothesis in a community-based survey, subjects with MMI or a low MMSE score (23 or lower) [16] and elderly controls were identified operationally by using the MMSE and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) short version [17]. Data on the number of remaining teeth, the length of the edentulous period, health-related lifestyles, and medical history were collected. Blood pressure, height, and body weight were measured, and fasting venous blood samples were also obtained. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to compare the number of remaining teeth and the length of the edentulous period in subjects with MMI or a low MMSE score with those in elderly controls.",1

The MMSE was carried out by clinical psychologists or interviewers who majored in psychology in graduate schools and were formally trained by a psychiatrist.",1

The GDS was included in a self-administered questionnaire survey.",1
16,8,"A dental examination was carried out by two dentists calibrated as to the techniques, with the dentist and the subject in a sitting position under artificial lighting. The number of teeth was recorded for each subject. The remaining teeth were defined as healthy, carious, or treated teeth (including crowned, inlay, and abutment teeth for bridge work), inclusive of completely erupted third molars. Root tips and very loose teeth that were indicated for extraction were not included as remaining teeth. The age at which edentulous individuals had lost all of their teeth was also recorded. The Community Periodontal Index (CPI) code [18] was recorded. The upper and lower teeth were divided into six prescribed segments, and each segment was subjected to further examination if it contained two or more remaining teeth that did not require extraction. The prescribed 10 representative teeth in the 6 segments (tooth position: 11, 16, 17, 26, 27, 31, 36, 37, 46, and 47) were examined. Each segment was assigned to one of five code levels (code 0, healthy; code 1, gingival bleeding after probing; code 2, calculus present in the periodontal pocket; code 3, periodontal pocket 4-5 mm deep; and code 4, periodontal pocket at least 6 mm deep), or an ineligible segment (a segment with one or no remaining teeth).",1

Each subject was interviewed to record the presence or absence of severe visual and hearing impairment, impairment of the basic (eating, dressing, bathing, toileting, and walking) and instrumental (use public transportation, shop for daily necessities, pay bills, and handle one’s own banking) ADL, and any history of disease (cancer, cerebrovascular disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension). After sitting quietly for more than 5 min, their blood pressure was determined twice at an interval of 30 s using an automatic blood-pressure manometer (ES-P2100; TERUMO Co., Tokyo, Japan) that displayed the values determined by the Korotkoff method.",1
16,10,"Examinations of the differences between the control and MMI groups, and between the control and low MMSE score groups were performed at the level of significance set for multiple comparisons based on the Bonferroni test, after the chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests were used. A trend test to detect the increased prevalence of MMI or a low MMSE score status according to the number of remaining teeth and CPI was performed using the Mantel-extension method [19]. Logistic regression analysis (by the forced entry method) was carried out with MMI and a low MMSE score as dependent variables. Depressive symptoms, sex, age, length of education, and other variables were used as independent variables. The number of remaining teeth and the length of time after the subjects became edentulous were used as continuous variables in one model and categorical variables in the other model. Goodness of fit was performed based on the technique of Hosmer and Lemeshow [20]. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 17.0; SPSS Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan).

16,13,"Figure 2 shows the prevalence of MMI or a low MMSE score. The number of remaining teeth (range: 0-32) was categorized into 3 equal categories (22-32, 11-21, and 0-10 teeth). No significant dose-response relationship was found in a trend test between the number of remaining teeth and the prevalence of MMI in the 65-74 years or 75 years or more categories, although the prevalence of MMI was higher in subjects with 0-10 remaining teeth than in those with 22-32 remaining teeth. The prevalence of a low MMSE score was 2.7% in subjects with 22-32 remaining teeth, 5.0% in those with 11-21 remaining teeth, and 6.8% in those with 0-10 remaining teeth in the 65-74 years category, and 4.0%, 8.0%, and 11.0% in the 75 years or more category, respectively. Significant increases in prevalence were found in a trend test in both age categories (P < 0.001) (upper panel, Figure 2).

16,14,"To analyze whether the presence of fewer remaining teeth was independently related to MMI or a low MMSE score status, we calculated the multivariateadjusted odds ratios (Table 2) using those factors with a calculated P value < 0.05 between the control and MMI groups or between the control and low MMSE score groups in Table 1. After the variables in the full models were adjusted, we observed significant relationships between the number of remaining teeth (per 1 decrease) to MMI (odds ratio: 1.021, 95% CI: 1.001-1.041) and a low MMSE score (odds ratio: 1.039, 95% CI: 1.0231.054). Furthermore, the odds ratio of 0-10 remaining teeth to 22-32 remaining teeth was 1.679 (95% CI: 1.073-2.627) for MMI and 2.177 (95% CI: 1.510-3.140) for a low MMSE score.",1

After multiple variables were adjusted (Table 3), the odds ratios of “per 1 year increase” and “15 years or more” for a low MMSE score were 1.058 (95% CI 1.014-1.103) and 3.102 (95% CI 1.432-6.720), respectively.",1
16,16,"This community-based survey revealed that the prevalence of a low MMSE score was significantly increased in association with the decrease in the number of remaining teeth (Figure 2). After adjustment for other explanatory variables (Table 2), a significant relationship between the decrease in the number of remaining teeth and a low MMSE score was observed. These results are consistent with those of previous reports demonstrating that tooth loss was associated with decreased cognitive function [21,22]. We also revealed that a decrease in the number of remaining teeth was associated with the risk of MMI.",1
16,17,"Four limitations of the present study merit consideration. The principal limitation was that the data were derived from a cross-sectional study; thus, we can only hypothesize for the biological credibility of the effect of tooth loss on MMI and a low MMSE score. Second, we did not investigate when tooth loss started or its causes. We also did not investigate markers of inflammation in the gingival crevicular fluid or alveolar bone loss measurements, by which the severity of periodontal disease can be evaluated more precisely than with the CPI code. Third, our criteria for identifying subjects with MMI were different from Ishikawa’s criteria [13] as we identified the absence of dementia or depression using the MMSE and GDS screening tests; however, the prevalence of MMI in our study (2.9%: 121/4,206) was similar to the prevalence of Japanese community-based mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [23,24] identified using the criteria of Petersen et al. [25]. Therefore, the MMI subjects in this study are considered to approximate individuals with MCI. Fourth, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping was not examined. Individuals with dementia had a higher frequency of APOE ε4 compared with nondemented individuals in Japanese-American men [26].",1
16,18,"The basis of the relationship between tooth loss and a low MMSE score was considered as given below. Older adults with a low MMSE score do not regularly use dental services [27]. In addition, older adults with dementia have increased plaque accumulation [5]. There may be other biological bases separate from the deterioration of dental health induced by cognitive impairment among tooth loss, MMI, and a low MMSE score, considering that a significant relationship was also found between tooth loss and MMI subjects who maintained the basic and instrumental ADL.",1
16,19,"Four further plausible biological explanations for the relationship between tooth loss and cognitive function can be proposed. First, periodontal disease, which is the cause of approximately 50% of all extractions in the elderly [28], may be associated with cognitive function through systemic inflammation. It has been hypothesized that inflammatory cytokines induced by periodontal disease can enter or influence the brain [9,29]. Second, genetic risk factors related to periodontal disease and cognitive function may be present; an interleukin 1 gene polymorphism has been reported to be associated with the severity of periodontal disease [30] and the risk of AD [31]. Third, a decrease in the number of periodontal mechanoreceptors due to tooth loss [32], which are sensory receptors, may result in a memory learning disorder. The functional deterioration of the cholinergic neuronal system in the parietal cortex has been observed in molar-loss rats [33]. In addition, the number of high-affinity tyrosine kinase B mRNA-positive cells in the hippocampal CA3 area was negatively affected by the duration of tooth loss and the number of teeth extracted [7]. However, these findings are based on animal models, and further investigations will be needed.",1
16,20,"Among edentulous subjects, a significant relationship was found between the length of the edentulous period and the risk of a low MMSE score after adjustment for their age at the baseline examination and other variables (Table 3). A history of “lost all teeth or lost half of teeth before age 35” was a significant risk factor for AD [3]. We observed a higher prevalence of individuals who were edentulous for 15 years or more in the MMI group (50.0%) than in the control group (34.4%), although no significant relationship was found; therefore, tooth loss may have a cumulative detrimental effect on the brain.",1
16,21,"While there was a significant relationship between the number of remaining teeth with the risk of MMI and a low MMSE score, no significant relationship was found between the CPI code, MMI, and a low MMSE score (Table 1 and Figure 2). The CPI is a marker of the current status of periodontal tissue, and it appears to underestimate the relationship between cognitive function and the cumulative burden of periodontal disease. We consider that tooth loss or periodontal disease may be associated with cognitive function because the prevalence of “Ineligible for CPI” was higher and the prevalence of “Code 0, 1, or 2” was lower in the MMI and low MMSE score groups than in the control group.",1
16,22,"Significant relationships were found between the number of remaining teeth, the length of the edentulous period, and cognitive function. Within the limitation of no APOE genotyping data, this cross-sectional study suggests a significant relationship of tooth loss to MMI and cognitive impairment. Further studies are needed to investigate the specific causes of this relationship.",1
18,1,"Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women and poses a threat to women’s health. Al-Hajj’s research in 2003 has shown that breast cancer stem cells (ESA+CD44+CD24-/low, BCSCs) possessing the stem cell properties of self-renewal and multi-directional differentiation are the most fundamental contributors to drug resistance, recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer [1]. Previous studies in both breast cancer cells and tissues have shown that breast cancer stem cells are cells with an ESA+CD44+CD24-/low phenotype [2,3]. We based this study on the previous findings on breast cancer stem cell phenotype and finally proved it. Research focusing on BCSCs is likely to bring revolutionary changes to our understanding of breast cancer; however, a multitude of unresolved issues remain with regard to the molecular basis of carcinogenesis. For example, what is the full nature of the involvement of BCSCs in the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis? Are microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in the function of BCSCs? If so, how are they involved?",1
18,2,"As an important class of regulatory noncoding RNAs, miRNAs have been shown to play important roles in the committed differentiation and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells [4]. The current release (10.0) of miRBase contains 5071 miRNA loci from 58 species [5]. miRNAs can act as oncogenes or anti-oncogenes and are involved in tumorigenesis, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, paediatric Burkitt’s lymphoma, gastric cancer, lung cancer and large-cell lymphoma [6-8]. In Homo sapiens, miRNAs (1048 sequences in miRBase 16, Sep 10th, 2010) regulate more than one-third of all genes, bringing hope to studies of cancer stem cells http://www.mirbase.org/. Thus, the identification of cancer stem cell-related miRNAs would provide valuable information for a better understanding of cancer stem cell properties and even the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated the miRNA expression profiles of ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/low BCSCs from the MCF-7 cell line.",1
18,3,"The human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen, America). Cells in log phase were digested with 0.25% trypsin (Gibco, America) and washed with PBS, then stained with FITC-conjugated anti-ESA, APC-conjugated antiCD44 and PE-conjugated anti-CD24 (BD PharMingen, America). After 30 min incubation, the cells were washed three times, and FACS (MoFlo, America) was performed to isolate the ESA+CD44+CD24-/low cells.",1
18,4,"The isolated ESA+CD44+CD24-/low lineage- cells were suspended in MEM supplemented with 1% FBS and washed twice with the same medium. The medium was then replaced with EpiCult™-B medium (Stemcell technologies, Canada) supplemented with 5% FBS. Subsequently, 1 × 10^4 BCSCs were seeded onto 2 × 10^4 irradiated NIH/3T3 feeder cells in 24-well plates. The mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line NIH/3T3 was cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen). As feeder layer cells, NIH/3T3 cells in log phase were exposed to 60 Co at 50 Gy. The medium was replaced again with serum-free EpiCult™-B medium at 24 hr after seeding, and the cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37°C. The cells were supplied with fresh medium every 3 days, and colonies were observed under a microscope after 7-10 days.",1
18,5,"Eight-week-old female NOD/SCID mice were given 2.5 Gy of 60Co radiation, and tumor cell injections were performed 1 day after irradiation. The tumor cells were suspended in 0.2 ml of IMDM containing 10% FBS and injected into the mammary fat pad at the left armpit. The mice in the test group were injected with 0.5 × 10^3, 1 × 10^3, 5 × 10^3, 1 × 10^4 or 5 × 10^4 ESA+CD44+CD24-/low cells isolated by FACS, whereas the mice in the control group were injected with 1 × 10^4, 5 × 10^4, 1 × 10^5, 5 × 10^5 or 1 × 10^6 MCF-7 cells. Three mice in each group were inoculated with the same amount of cells. The mice were observed for tumor growth every 10 days over 8 weeks and then sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Single cell suspensions were obtained according to our previously published protocol [9]. Subsequently, ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/low cells were isolated from the xenograft tumor cells by FACS and injected into the mammary fat pad as described above. All animal procedures were carried out with the approval of the Animal Ethics Committee of the Third Military Medical University.",1
18,6,"Tumor tissue slides were prepared for immunohistochemistry. Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and smooth muscle actin (SMA), markers of luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells, respectively, were used for immunostaining according to our previously published protocol [9]. Rabbit polyclonal anti-EMA or anti-SMA antibodies (dilution 1:500; Santa Cruz, CA) were used.",1
18,7,"Both miRNA microarray fabrication and hybridisation were performed as described previously [9]. Our miRNA microarray included 517 mature miRNA sequences and 122 published predicted miRNA (Pred_miR) sequences [10]. For each sample, two hybridisations were carried out, and each miRNA probe had three replicate spots on the microarray. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM, version 2.1) was performed using a two classunpaired comparison in the SAM procedure.",1

18,10,"The expression of ESA, CD44 and CD24 in MCF-7 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. A 1-2% frequency of ESA+ CD44 + CD24 -/low lineage- cells was observed, and the cells were isolated by flow cytometry (Figure 1A). Using FACS sorting, this subpopulation of cells was highly purified (98-99% purity). To assess the clonogenic potential of these BCSCs, the cells were seeded into 24-well plates on top of irradiated NIH/3T3 feeder cells. At day 3, the number of adherent cells increased, and three to five epithelioid colonies formed. At day 6, the colonies continued to expand and spread stereoscopically. After 10 days in culture, most of the colonies contained more than 50 cells and were surrounded by floating or dead NIH/3T3 cells. Under an inverted phase contrast microscope, the ESA+ CD44+ CD24-/low cells were observed to grow into globular colonies (Figure 1B). These cells showed no special morphological changes, however, compared with MCF-7 cells.",1
18,11,"We injected isolated ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/low cells and MCF-7 cells (as a control) subcutaneously into the armpits of NOD/SCID mice. After 8 weeks, the MCF-7 cells gave rise to new tumors when ≥5 × 10^5 cells were injected but failed to do so at lower doses (1 × 10^5 cells). In contrast, the ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/low cells formed tumors in three of three, three of three and one of three animals when 5 × 10^4 , 1 × 10^4 , and 5 × 10^3 cells were injected, respectively. Tumor specimens were retrieved and subsequently passaged into recipient mice. At 8 weeks after inoculation, three of three, three of three, and two of three recipient animals formed tumors when 5 × 104, 1 × 104 and 5 × 103 cells were injected, respectively. Tumors were also observed in one of three animals in the control group when 5 × 105 cells were injected; however, 5 × 104 -1 × 105 cells failed to form tumors in the control group (Table 1 Figure 1C). These data indicate that ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/low cells are tumorigenic and have up to 100- to 1000-fold greater tumor-initiating capability than MCF-7 cells.",1
18,12,"In addition, we tested ESA+CD44+/CD24- subpopulation variability in the murine model by FACS analysis. ESA+CD44+/CD24- subpopulation in unsorted MCF-7 xenografts remained to be 1-2%, showing little change. By contrast, ESA+CD44+/CD24- subpopulation in sorted MCF-7 xenografts were significantly enriched to 4-5%.",1
18,13,"Tumor tissue slides were prepared for H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining. The tumors in the BCSCs group were positive for both EMA and SMA, indicating that they were included of both luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. On the other hand, the tumors in the MCF-7 control group were positive for EMA, but negative for SMA, indicating that they were included of luminal epithelial cells, but not myoepithelial cells (Figure 2).",1
18,14,"For each cell type, the hybridisation reaction was repeated twice. The internal control U6 snRNA spots on all of the microarrays showed consistent signal strength, and the signal intensity of all of the detected spots on the replicate microarrays indicated high correlation coefficients (R = 0.9747 ± 0.0304), highlighting the reproducibility of hybridisation between the replicate microarrays(Additional file 1 Figure S1). There were 147 miRNAs in the MCF-7 cells and 102 miRNAs in the BCSCs, including predicted miRNAs (PRED_MIR), which gave a signal value above 800. The previously reported miRNA expression profile of MCF-7 cells (Ambion, USA) included 41 miRNAs (signal value ≥++). Among those miRNAs, 34 were also detected in our study, indicating a concordance rate of 82.9% (Additional file 1Table S1 S2 & S3). We compared the miRNA expression profiles of BCSCs and MCF-7 cells using a normalisation factor and clustering. A miRNA was defined as differentially expressed when a value of p < 0.05 was obtained. We identified 25 differentially expressed miRNAs that fell into two groups (fold change ≥ 4).",1
18,15,"We performed real-time RT-PCR for 10 miRNAs: miR122a, miR-188, miR-200a, miR-21, miR-224, miR-296, miR-301, miR-31, miR-373* and miR-200C. As a negative control, miR-200C did not show obvious difference in our study. The experiments were repeated three times each. Eight of the ten miRNAs tested gave realtime RT-PCR results that were concordant with the microarray data, with miR-296 being the only exception, indicating a concordance rate of 88.89%. The electrophoretogram showed clear and specific bands for all of the real-time RT-PCR reactions, and all the amplification curves in the PCR reactions were distinct (Figure 3A). Part of amplification curves for miR-188, miR-200a miR301 and miR-31 are shown in Figure 3B. The Q-RT-PCR results for the 10 miRNAs tested were 6.344 ± 0.402, 0.226 ± 0.513, 0.086 ± 0.514, 0.071 ± 0.503, 14.175 ± 2.033, 0.334 ± 0.587, 0.066 ± 1.008, 2.816 ± 0.328, 6.684 ± 0.548 and 0.345 ± 0.531 (expressed as the relative ratio between the Q-RT-PCR results for BCSCs and MCF-7 cells ± standard deviation). Despite little difference in the microarray results, the expression of miR-200c was found to be no more than three times lower in BCSCs than in MCF-7 (Figure 3CTable 2). Thus, the miRNA expression profiles of the BCSCs were confirmed by Q-RT-PCR.",1
18,16,"Chromosome localisation, sequence analysis and target prediction of the miRNAs were carried out using online software programs. Potential tumorigenesis-related miRNAs and their possible targets were analysed. Most of these targets were oncogenes, anti-oncogenes or regulatory genes involved in miRNA processing, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, apoptosis regulation and stem cell function and maintenance, etc. For example, there were 161 potential targets of miR122a, including RAD21, G3BP2, CDC42BPB, SP2, GPR172B, GPR172A, MAP3K3, DR1, KHDRBS1, MAP3K12, CCNG1 and DICER1. These potential targets included oncogenes, transcription factors and genes related to DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, miRNA processing and signal transduction. The gene encoding miR-21 was located on chromosome 17, and there were 175 potential targets of miR-21, including PLAG1, PDCD4, SKI, BCL2, STAT3, PITX2, HBP1, ELF2, E2F3, SPRY1, CDC25A, N-PAC, EIF1AX, EIF2C2, RAB11A, RAB6A, RAB6C, RASGRP1, RHOB, RASA1, TPM1, TGFBI and TNFSF6, which exist exclusively in humans, mice, dogs, chimps and chickens. These potential targets included pleiomorphic adenoma genes, transcription factors, oncogenes, anti-oncogenes, and genes related to miRNA processing and signal transduction (Additional file 1 table S4).",1
15,1,"In recent years, there has been a significant amount of research conducted on corticomuscular synchronization while isometrically compensating for static forces. Monkey studies have reported beta-range (15-30 Hz) corticomuscular coherence (CMC) between motor cortical neurons and muscles, while studies on humans have shown CMC between sensorimotor cortex and muscle activity (EMG). The studies mentioned range from 1 to 14 in number.",0
15,2,"Gamma-range CMC was investigated in relation to corticospinal interactions and motor tasks, with different subranges associated with different tasks. For example, 40-70 Hz CMC was correlated with readiness to respond in a simple reaction-time task, while 35-60 Hz CMC occurred mainly for submaximal and maximal forces. The high gamma subrange (61-100 Hz) showed significant ECoG-EMG coherence during phasic movements. A lower gammasubrange (30-45 Hz) reflected the integration of proprioceptive, visual, and cognitive information required for motor command in a visuomotor isometric compensation task. Gamma-range CMC was found to not be modulated by the amplitude of the modulated force, prompting the question of whether it is modulated by various frequencies.",0
15,3,"During a visuomotor task, we examined the CMC, cortical motor spectral power, and motor performance. Subjects compensated isometrically a force that was periodically modulated at 8% MVC with three frequencies, namely 0.6, 1.0 and 1.6 Hz.",0
15,4,"Based on our previous findings that the CMC shifts from beta to gamma range during compensation of static and periodically modulated force, we tested the prediction that the CMC would shift towards higher frequencies with an increase in frequency modulation. This shift was expected to facilitate the integration of sensorimotor information.",0
15,5,"Recent research has shown that when individuals perform rhythmic hand movements, there is an increase in beta-range corticomuscular coherence (CMC) which is accompanied by a peak in CMC at the frequency of the movement or muscle contraction. This led to the prediction of CMC peaks at frequencies of modulated force and the speculation of stronger low-frequency CMC peaks for more difficult tasks and higher frequencies.",0
15,6,"According to our study, the modulation of force frequencies did not affect beta- and gamma-range CMC and cortical motor spectral power during isometric compensation at 8% MVC. However, a distinct bilateral CMC peak at 1.6 Hz was observed in the five gamma-range CMC subjects. Based on this, we suggest that the frequency range of CMC is influenced by various factors such as task parameters, individual differences, and behavioral strategies.",0
15,7,The study involved 8 female participants who were all right-handed and had no prior neurological issues. Their average age was 28 with a standard deviation of 10 years. Hand dominance was determined using the Oldfield questionnaire. Three of the participants had previously taken part in comparable experiments within the same laboratory. All participants gave informed consent and followed the guidelines set out in the declaration of Helsinki as well as receiving approval from the local ethics committee.,0
15,8,The participant was situated in a room that was electrically shielded and had low lighting. They had their right arm secured by a splint and were directed to place their hand on a sphere while positioning their right index finger in the ring of a custom-made manipulator (refer to Figure 1B).,0
15,9,"The device called manipulandum was created to exert vertical forces on the finger at the metacarpophalangeal joint level. A tooth belt drive controlled by a computer generated a force that varied on the ring. The participant had to isometrically counteract the force produced by the manipulandum to keep the ring in its original position, indicated in Figure 1B. Meanwhile, the subject received visual feedback about the ring's position, displayed on a 19'' monitor 100 cm away. The screen showed two concentric circles, with the green outer one at the centre representing the reference position of the ring, and the white inner one indicating the actual position of the ring, changing as the subject adapted to the manipulandum's force. The goal was to align the white circle with the green one, which required the subject to generate a force opposite to the one applied to the ring, in this case, flexion. The sensitivity of the feedback was 2 mm on the screen for a 1 mm displacement of the ring.",0
15,10,"The force generated had four phases as shown in Figure 1D. The first phase was a ramp phase with a rising cosine function that ensured a smooth start of the force, and the force level or ramp amplitude for all experimental conditions remained constant at 8% MVC. The second phase lasted for 3 seconds and was a static force period (T0) that allowed time for stabilizing the force at the ""0"" position. The third phase was a sinusoidally modulated force period with 8% MVC peak-to-peak amplitude that lasted for 15 seconds. Finally, a downward ramp phase with a cosine function was implemented to ensure a smooth end of the generated force.",0
15,11,"The recording session investigated three experimental conditions as shown in Figure 1D. The first condition, labeled W1, had a frequency of 0.6 Hz for the force modulation (shown in the left panel). The second condition, labeled W2, had a frequency of 1 Hz for the force modulation (shown in the middle panel). The third condition, labeled W3, had a frequency of 1.6 Hz for the force modulation (shown in the right panel).",0
15,12,"The frequencies W1, W2, and W3 were chosen to be equidistant on a logarithmic scale, satisfying the relationships W2 = 5/3 × W1 and W3 = 8/5 × W2. W2 is thus approximately the geometric mean of W1 and W3, and this choice aligns with the logarithmic discrimination abilities of humans. Additionally, no single frequency overlapped with another frequency's harmonics on the frequency spectrum to minimize crosstalk. This information can be found in [28] and [29].",0
15,13,"Before the test began, we monitored the resting EEG of participants for 5 minutes while they focused on a small white circle and relaxed their right hand on a sphere with their right index finger positioned in the manipulandum's ring. The manipulandum did not apply any pressure during this resting phase, allowing the index finger to stay still in its initial position. Next, we gauged the force equal to their individual MVC. The experimental session involved five different recording series, with each series consisting of 18 trials. The experimental conditions (W1, W2, W3) were presented in a pseudo-random order within each set of 18 trials, ensuring that each frequency was featured six times in one recording series. Consequently, each subject completed a total of 30 trials for each of the three frequency conditions. To prevent muscle fatigue, we included rest periods of 7 to 12 seconds between trials and about 5 minutes between series.",0
15,14,"The subjects were instructed to focus on the time pattern of the applied force and adjust their finger muscle contraction accordingly in order to maintain consistent performance and avoid distractions during trials. They were then asked to verbally identify the force frequency as either slow, middle, or fast, corresponding to 0.6 Hz (W1), 1 Hz (W2), and 1.6 Hz (W3) after each trial.",0
15,15,"The participants were directed to refrain from making any other movements and to focus on the concentric circles exhibited on the monitor. Prior to the beginning of the recordings, the participants underwent some trials to acquaint themselves with the assignment.",0
15,16,"The international 10-10 system was used to record electrical potentials from 58 scalp positions at a bandpass of 0-200 Hz and a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The reference was set to Cz, with the ground at FzA, and electrode impedances were kept under 5 kOhm. To exclude trials contaminated with eye movements, the electrooculogram (EOG) was recorded at the same bandpass and sampling rate as the EEG. Electromyographic activity (EMG) was also recorded using a belly-tendon montage from three muscles: FLE, FDI, and EXT, all at a bandpass of 0-200 Hz and a sampling rate of 1000 Hz.",0
15,17,"The recorded finger position was divided into 30 epochs of 24 seconds each, commencing 2 seconds prior to the beginning of the trial. The mean finger position's temporal profile was ascertained for each participant by averaging the 30 epochs, and the finger position's grand average was calculated across all participants. T0, T1, and T2 were identified based on the finger position's grand average, with T0 representing a three-second static force period, T1 corresponding to a period distinguished by significant transient fluctuations of the finger position, and T2 representing a period in which the finger position reached a steady state and remained stable until the conclusion of the force modulation.  (Figure 1E illustrates this.)",0
15,18,"The analysis only included data from two periods, T1 and T2. During each trial, the data recorded during the 15-second sinusoidal force modulation was separated into two sets, T1 (3 seconds) and T2 (12 seconds). These sets were further divided into 1-second segments with a 50% overlap for spectral analysis. Eye movement-contaminated segments were excluded from the analysis using visual artifact rejection. The EEG signal was transformed into the reference-free current source density distribution using the spherical spline interpolation method. For each subject, 100 segments were obtained from T1, and 400 from T2.",0
15,19,"The EMG signals were subjected to fullwave rectification, as this method is suitable for power and coherence analysis and provides the temporal pattern of grouped firing motor units [32]. Each segment was then subject to a discrete 1000 points Fourier transform.",0
15,20,"Figure 1D displays the desired force profiles for W1, W2, and W3. Despite the conditions, there were fluctuations (~ 3 mm) in the ring position during T0, which refers to the static force that follows the force ramp, as depicted in Figure 1E. However, all participants were able to compensate for the force ramp before T0 ended, allowing the finger to return to the '0' position before the force modulation started.",0
15,21,"The finger positions during 30 trials in all participants for W1, W2 and W3 are displayed in Figure 1E as grand-averages. The oscillation frequency in all three conditions corresponded to the target frequency. It is worth noting that the finger oscillations had larger amplitudes during the initial 3 seconds (T1 period) but became stabilized at slightly lower amplitudes during the T2 period. A steady-state oscillatory performance was observed around the '0' position with deviations of maximally 1.5 mm in both directions.",0
15,22,"Figure 2A displays the average DR values of all participants for the three conditions (W1, W2, and W3). It is evident that participants identified the frequency of force accurately in more than 90% of the 30 trials. The DR increased from around 90% to approximately 95% as the frequency of force modulation increased, with the highest DR observed for W3. The majority of the participants exhibited this trend, indicating that they were more aware of the temporal force profile as the force modulation rate increased. Nevertheless, the Friedman test did not show any significant difference among the three conditions in terms of DR values.",0
15,23,"There was a significant difference in performance errors (PE) between the two periods T1 and T2, with higher fluctuations in finger position during T1. This was supported by statistical comparison (F(1,7) = 95, p < 0.001) and reflected in the grand-average of finger position (Figure 1E). Additionally, PE increased significantly at higher frequencies (F(1,7) = 10.7, p < 0.01, Figure 2B) with a linear effect (p = 0.02) underpinning the increase rather than a quadratic effect.",0
15,24,"The highest coherences between EEG and EMG were witnessed in the opposite sensorimotor cortex (C3 or C1). Figure 3 and Figure 4 exhibit coherence curves of the 0.6 Hz, 1 Hz, and 1.6 Hz conditions of eight individuals during T1 and T2 times, respectively.",0
15,25,"During the initial phase T1, the CMC spectra displayed a number of sharp peaks with random patterns scattered across the range of 15-45 Hz (as illustrated in Figure 3). Subsequently in phase T2, where motor performance became comparably consistent, the CMC spectra exhibited consistent coherences resolved from beta (15-32) to gamma (25-45 Hz) bands (as seen in Figure 4). The statistical analysis of three-way ANOVA corroborated the enhanced CMC in T2 as a principal source of variation, with considerably greater values (F(1,7) = 21, p < 0.001).",0
15,26,"Based on Figure 4, the majority of the five subjects displayed broad-band Coherent Motion in gamma-range (25-45 Hz), while three of the subjects exhibited it in beta-range (15-32 Hz). The factor Subject had a significant main effect on the Center of Gravity (CoG) which led to the categorization of the subjects into more beta- and more gamma-group. However, some subjects showed peaks in both beta and gamma-range. For example, subjects S4, S5, and S6 displayed lower peaks in beta-range. The purpose of grouping subjects into beta- and gamma-groups was to capture the major differences in the CMC pattern.",0
15,27,The frequency of the modulated force did not have a significant effect on either the CMC amplitude or the CoGs according to the results of the statistical analysis.,0
15,28,"The study searched for significant CMC values between 0-5 Hz range that peaked at the frequencies of force modulation or their harmonics. All five gamma subjects demonstrated a low-frequency CMC peak at 2 Hz, which matched the frequency modulation W3. This peak was consistently observed in the 1.6 Hz condition and was observed over both sensorimotor areas. Low-frequency CMC peaks at 2 Hz were only observed in electrodes above sensorimotor areas and none of the beta-group subjects had this peak. The results are shown in Figure 4 and 5.",0
15,29,The ANOVA did not find any significant main effect or interaction for the three factors tested in relation to the amplitude of cortical motor SP. There was no increase in spectral power in the same frequency range among subjects with increased CMC in beta or gamma-range.,0
15,30,"There were no differences in beta and gamma power between subjects in the beta and gamma ranges during rest, as observed from their cortical spectral power.",0
15,31,"The objective of the study was to investigate the interactions of corticospinal during isometric compensation while altering the frequency of force modulation. The results revealed that a stable CMC and performance could only be achieved after the force was adjusted to the modulation frequency in the transitory phase. Sharp peaks in the 15-45 Hz range were observed in the CMC spectra during this phase, indicating a transitory regime of corticospinal circuits functioning. During the stationary phase, CMC occurred in five of the eight subjects in gamma-range and three of them in beta-range. The study found that force modulation frequencies did not modify the gamma or beta-range CMC. Additionally, a sharp CMC peak at 2 Hz was noticed solely during the highest frequency of force modulation, indicating that corticospinal circuits resonating at the force frequency have a crucial role in the task of isometric force compensation.",0
15,32,The focus of our research was to examine CMC in slow and precise natural movements that usually take place between 0-2 Hz frequency range. The results demonstrated that there was no alteration in the beta- and gamma-range CMC's amplitude or frequency range when the force modulation frequency was increased in this range.,0
15,33,"Any conclusions drawn from this outcome should consider the following constraints. The frequency of the force may actually affect corticospinal oscillations, but our experimental setup's specific frequency range of interest (0.6 - 1.6 Hz) could have masked this effect. We decided to limit this range due to concerns about muscle stiffness at higher frequencies and the need to perceive the modulated force's dynamic changes. Furthermore, even within this range, force frequency modulation might impact CMC, but EEG or MEG recordings cannot easily detect this due to the scattering of neighboring neural sources. Intracortical recordings are required to address this issue further. Nevertheless, our findings align with the possibility that neither the amplitude nor the frequency of modulated force has any bearing on CMC.",0
15,34,"The difficulty in interpreting the discovery of five gamma and three beta-range subjects becomes apparent considering that there was no significant difference in performance error and awareness of the modulation frequencies between the two groups, as reflected in the DR. Therefore, the variance in the CMC frequency range did not appear to have any correlation with behavioral performance or differences in prior experience. These results imply that there are inherent differences in CMC among individuals, and that they may equally complete the visuomotor task by recruiting different functional corticospinal circuits that resonate in either beta or gamma range. This was previously explained in a study of ours exploring the CMC while using modulated forces at 8% MVC [17].",0
15,35,"However, aside from interindividual differences, other factors should be considered. The beta- and gamma-subjects may have employed different strategies to compensate for the modulated forces. While they were instructed to attend to the force modulations and report the frequency, some may have opted to precisely encode the temporal profile of the force and generate an opposing ""dynamic"" pattern or exert a ""pseudo-static force"" at the 8% MVC level, regardless of modulation frequency. The former strategy may induce corticospinal oscillations in the gamma range to integrate proprioceptive, visual, and cognitive information rapidly, while the latter may rely primarily on the static characteristics of the force profile (the 8% MVC force level) and result in beta-range corticomuscular coherence, which is linked to stable and inflexible regimes of corticospinal interactions.",0
15,36,"The studies conducted previously showed that there was beta-range CMC during isometric compensation for low-level static forces at 4% MVC and predominantly gamma-range (30-45 Hz) CMC during dynamic force compensation. However, in a recent study where different levels of a modulated force (8, 16, 24% MVC) were applied, broad-band beta-range CMC was also found. Hence, beta-range CMC is not restricted to low-level static forces only. The sensorimotor system may employ either beta- or gamma-range CMC to create effective corticospinal interaction for compensating dynamic modulated forces. Both mechanisms represent effective corticospinal interaction and can be selectively used to fulfill different functions.",0
15,37,"The conclusion made by Tallon-Baudry in her review article is that there is no direct correlation between a frequency band and a particular cognitive function. However, our findings show that the same holds true for frequency band and individual motor function as well.",0
15,38,"At the highest investigated force modulation frequency of 1.6 Hz, an extra CMC peak at the same frequency was discovered. This peak was only seen in the five gamma subjects. Recent studies of corticospinal interaction when participants synchronized rhythmic foot movements or isometric contraction of calf muscles to external periodic events have demonstrated similar CMC patterns over the sensorimotor area. In instances where a CMC peak was linked with muscle contraction or movement frequency, it correlated with corticospinal synchronization processes during dynamic motor output. We perceive the coexistence of a CMC peak at 1.6 Hz (modulated force frequency) and gamma-range CMC as evidence of effective corticospinal interaction. The fact that the CMC peak at 2 Hz was solely found at the highest frequency tested (1.6 Hz) might be explained by larger performance faults, implying increased task difficulty. Prior research has shown that for frequencies exceeding 1.5 Hz, performance difficulties intensify during a tracking task, as stated by Flowers.",0
15,39,"Nesting low-frequency oscillations (theta) with high-frequency ones (gamma) facilitates multiplexing of processes in the same area, according to studies [39,45,46]. Lakatos et al. [47] proposed that slower rhythms create openings for high-frequency oscillations to be activated. The nesting of CMC gamma-range into 1.6 Hz oscillations may assist in managing the increased task demands in our experiment.",0
15,40,"The DR increased with higher force frequencies, exceeding 95% for the 1.6 Hz modulation. This corresponds with previous research that suggests increased awareness of external periodic events occurs with a higher rate of change. Nonetheless, any association between awareness of force frequency and a CMC peak at the corresponding frequency is largely speculative, and requires further assessment through experimental paradigms that explicitly manipulate awareness of the force profiles.",0
15,41,"According to our study, the rate of force modulation does not impact the beta- and gamma-range CMC while performing isometric compensation at 8% MVC. Individual differences may be a factor in the beta- and gamma-range CMC. However, the peak in CMC at 2 Hz during the highest force modulation frequency (1.6 Hz) suggests that corticospinal circuits resonating at the force frequency are crucial for isometric force compensation. Our results contribute to the understanding of global oscillatory processes and provide new insights into the dynamics of neural systems.",0
17,1,"Hypoalbuminemia may result from different conditions such as nephrotic syndrome, heart failure, liver disease, and malnutrition. In hospitalized patients, both acute and chronic inflammatory responses commonly cause hypoalbuminemia. Additionally, low serum albumin levels have been linked with a higher risk of mortality. As such, the serum albumin level is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality among older individuals and acts as a vital prognostic marker.",0
17,2,"Since 1990, we have been performing health screenings on the adult population of X town, located in northern Kyushu, Japan, which has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the country and a liver cancer mortality rate that is triple the national average. According to a study conducted in 1990, the positive rates of antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV), HCV RNA, and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were 23.6%, 17.9%, and 2.6%, respectively. Our findings also revealed that HCV-infected individuals in X town experience extrahepatic manifestations and that there is a natural course and carcinogenesis associated with the infection.",0

17,4,"In 1990, a random sample of 10% (739 people) from the population of 7,389 inhabitants was selected for a study on liver diseases related to HCV or HBV infections. A total of 509 individuals participated in the study and were followed for 12 years. By May 31, 2002, 69 participants had died and 55 had relocated, leaving 385 original residents in the town. Ultimately, 454 residents were studied, with albumin levels categorized as either low (<4.0 g/L, group A) or normal (≥4.0 g/L, group B). There were 25 subjects in group A and 429 in group B.",0
17,5,"In 1990, 454 subjects provided sera for various serological assays including albumin, serum AST, and ALT. The sera were also tested for markers of HCV and HBV infection using CLEIA and CLIA kits. HCV RNA was detected using the Amplicor HCV test. Subjects with abnormal liver function tests and positive for anti-HCV or HBsAg underwent ultrasonographic examination to investigate liver shape and lesions in the hepatic space.",0
17,6,"The criteria for obesity was a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or above. We gathered information on liver diseases, smoking, and alcohol consumption and compared these variables between group A and group B. Total alcohol consumption was estimated based on the reported consumption of various alcoholic beverages. To calculate cumulative ethanol consumption up to 1990, we converted the alcohol intake in each serving of different alcoholic beverages into grams.",0

Group A consisted of 25 individuals whose serum albumin level was less than 4.0 g/L, while Group B was composed of 429 subjects whose serum albumin level was 4.0 g/L or greater. The mean age of Group A was 68.8 ± 14.5 years, and it consisted of 16 men and nine women. Group B, on the other hand, had a mean age of 51.9 ± 15.9 years and 180 men and 249 women.

On the other hand, in group B, six deaths were due to lung cancer, four due to colon cancer, three due to HCC, two due to gastric cancer, one each for esophageal cancer, leukemia, malignant lymphoma, and one unknown cause. The mortality rate due to HCC was 66.7% (6/9 cases) in group A, and 15.8% (3/19) in group B, with a significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.01).

Among the residents suffering from hypoalbuminemia, the mortality rate was 68.0%, which is significantly higher than the rate of 12.1% among those residents who had normal albumin levels. In our earlier study, we revealed that HCV infection and ALT value were connected to deaths resulting from liver cirrhosis or HCC in X town [17]. In addition, our research displays that hypoalbuminemia is a prognostic factor for all-cause mortality.",0
17,17,"Approximately 170 million people globally have HCV, with 1% residing in Japan. HCV leads to serious liver conditions such as cirrhosis and HCC. In Japan, around 80% of HCC cases are caused by HCV, contributing to an increase in HCC-related deaths. This trend is expected to continue until 2015.  Around 16% of HCC cases in Japan are caused by HBV infection.",0
17,18,"Albumin, the main protein in the bloodstream, is produced solely by the liver and is made up of 585 amino acids with a molecular weight of around 69 kDa. Despite albumin being the most abundant plasma protein, 60% of it is found in the interstitial space, and it plays a vital role in maintaining the oncotic pressure within the vascular system. An insufficient albumin level results in lower oncotic pressure causing fluids to leak from the interstitial spaces into the peritoneal cavity, leading to ascites. Albumin is also an essential molecule transporter that binds to various substances such as bilirubin, free fatty acids, drugs, and hormones. Additionally, serum albumin is a widely available, multifunctional plasma protein, commonly known for its ligand-binding and transport characteristics, as well as antioxidant and enzymatic activities.",0
17,19,"A low concentration of serum albumin is an indication of poor liver function, but it does not immediately occur in cases of acute liver failure. The decline in serum albumin levels happens gradually over several weeks due to impaired albumin production. Chronic liver failure caused by cirrhosis is the leading reason for low albumin levels. During the early stages of chronic liver disease, the serum albumin concentration is typically normal until significant liver damage and cirrhosis develop. In advanced liver disease, the serum albumin level can drop below 3.5 g/dl. Clinically, the albumin level is an important predictive factor for patients with liver cirrhosis because low serum albumin levels can lead to ascites and edema.",0
17,20,"Nutritional interventions such as BCAA supplementation have been shown to improve hypoalbuminemia in cirrhotic patients. Kotho et al. found that exercise and protein-rich nutrition in the early stages of cirrhosis may benefit maintaining or increasing muscular volume. Nishiguchi et al. reported that oral BCAA supplementation could help maintain serum albumin in patients in the compensated stage with a lower BTR. Early stage nutritional interventions could improve prognosis and QOL. Additionally, BCAA supplementation using Aminofeel ® has been found to increase serum albumin and zinc levels, and improve sensitivity to different tastes. [Mask]",0
17,21,"""Our findings have shown that the serum albumin level plays a crucial role in predicting the risk of mortality in the people residing in X town.

18,17,"MiRNAs are increasingly found to play a role in mammalian biology and breast cancer. MiR-206 levels have been observed to be higher in ERalpha-negative MB-MDA-231 cells compared to ERalpha-positive MCF-7 cells, while enforced expression of miR-125a or miR-125b leads to suppression of ERBB2 and ERBB3 in the human breast cancer cell line SKBR3. Additionally, MiR-27b expressed in MCF-7 cells may contribute to high CYP1B1 levels in cancerous tissues, and miR-17-5p suppresses breast cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting AIB1 mRNA translation.",0
18,18,"The roles of BCSC-related miRNAs in breast cancer have significant importance, and the isolation of tumorigenic breast cancer cells with stem/progenitor cell properties by Ponti and screening of side population (SP) cells from a breast cancer cell line by Huang highlights this. This study aimed to investigate the miRNA expression profile of the ESA + CD44 + CD24 -/Low subpopulation from the MCF-7 cell line, and the concordant results from real-time RT-PCR and microarray data validate the miRNA expression profiles of BCSCs.",0
18,19,"miRNA expression in BCSCs has been the subject of a few recent studies. According to Shimono's research, 37 miRNAs were either upregulated or downregulated in BCSCs compared to non-tumorigenic breast cancer cells. Human BCSCs exhibited a decrease in three clusters of miRNAs, namely miR-200c-141, miR-200b-200a-429, and miR-183-96182. MCF-7 cells showed overexpression of miR-200c, which resulted in the decline of transcription factor 8's expression and an increase in E-cadherin. Human BCSCs have been previously reported to showcase a downregulation of Let-7 miRNAs instead of miR-200C. Let-7 regulates several breast cancer stem cell properties by inhibiting more than one target. While Let-7 miRNAs reduce in BCSCs, they increase during differentiation.",0
18,20,"The miRNA expression profiles of BCSCs were obtained, providing a solid foundation for investigating the roles of miRNAs in maintaining stem cell features and biological functions of BCSCs. Our findings showed that miR-200C expression was about 3 times lower in BCSCs compared to MCF-7 cells, whilst Let-7 family member expression was mostly unchanged between the two cell types, except for Let-7e. Inconsistencies in Let-7 and miR-200C expression could be due to tumor histology or genetic variations in cell lines. Furthermore, the existence of certain predicted miRNAs in BCSCs was detected, but real-time RT-PCR verification was limited due to lack of accurate miRNA sequences necessary to synthesize precise primers. Future examination of these characteristic BCSC miRNAs will help expand our knowledge on miRNA functions in breast cancer research.",0
18,21,"Bioinformatic analysis and prediction programs have been utilized as the primary methods for investigating the function of miRNAs. The genes possibly regulated by these specific BCSC miRNAs are associated with both tumorigenesis and stem cell maintenance. Despite previous reports indicating that miR-122a is solely expressed in liver tissue, our results indicate upregulation of miR-122a in BCSCs. This was confirmed through Q-RT-PCR as well as the detection of miR-122a in the Ambion dataset. Bioinformatic analysis has shown that several cancer-related genes are potential targets of miR-122a. Studies have further demonstrated that miR-122a likely functions as an important gene regulatory factor in cancer cells, including cancer stem cells. Another example is miR21, which is expressed in embryonic stem cells, neuronal cells, as well as several tumor tissues and has a variety of functions.",0
18,22,"The analysis of miR-21's target revealed two sets of genes with contrasting functions, namely PLAG1 and PDCD4. While PLAG1 is a cancer-promoting gene and aids in the formation of adenocarcinoma, PDCD4 acts as a tumor suppressor gene and restrains neoplastic development. Recent studies have confirmed that PDCD4 is indeed a direct target of miR-21, but it is still unclear whether PLAG1 is as well. Additionally, miR-21 potentially targets other oncogenes like RAB11A, RAB6A, RAB6C, RASGRP1, RHOB, and RASA1, and their mechanisms in breast cancer remain to be explored. These questions remain unanswered.",0
18,23,"The identification of potential targets for different BCSC-related miRNAs suggested that some targets were shared between multiple miRNAs. For instance, PLAG1 was a potential target for both miR-224 and miR-200a, and the expression of miR-200a was lower in BCSCs and higher in MCF-7 cells. Conversely, miR-224 expression was elevated in BCSCs and lower in MCF-7 cells. It is probable that miRNAs differentially expressed in BCSCs might regulate common target genes and assemble a miRNA gene network by cooperating or competing with each other to control the development of BCSCs.",0
18,24,"It has been reported that miR-301, miR-296, miR-21 and miR-373* are expressed in stem cells, including human embryonic stem cells, suggesting that these miRNAs may be involved in maintaining stem cell features. Further research is needed to confirm the potential targets of all the miRNAs associated with BCSCs that were discovered in this study.",0
