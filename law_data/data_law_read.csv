47,1,"This study is an assessment of economic knowledge among students who receive formal economic instruction in their senior year of high school. Our sample was drawn from seven high schools in two large school districts in Orange County, California. Students were enrolled in the compulsory, semester-long economics course, a state requirement for high school graduation. Our key performance measure is the Test of Economic Literacy (TEL). Using a pretest每post-test design, we find that initial knowledge of economics is not strong among the students. After one semester of formal economics instruction, TEL examination scores improve by 12.3 percentage points on average.",1
47,2,"The need for improving economic and financial literacy is now being frequently discussed in the media, a sign that policy makers and educators are more aware of the importance of economic literacy for children, teenagers, and young adults. Evidence of this increased awareness can be found in the public attention given to the second and third National Summit on Economic & Financial Literacy [NCEE, March 2005 and February 2008]. Likewise, the academic literature has long emphasized the importance of economics education in high school [Walstad 1992; Salemi and Siegfried 1999; Walstad and Rebeck 2000; Walstad 2001], and there is a growing body of literature that investigates issues related to the teaching and learning of economics at the high school and college level [e.g., Becker et al. 1990; Harris and Kerby 1997; Lopus 1997; Melican et al. 1997; Allgood and Walstad 1999; Walstad and Rebeck 2001a; Belfield and Levin 2004].",1
47,3,"This paper presents results from our investigation of economic literacy among high school students in Orange County, California. Since 1985, California high school graduation requirements have included one semester of economics. The course is taken by students in their senior year in high school, and it exposes them to the basics of microeconomic and macroeconomic analyses. California is one of only 17 states [NCEE June 2007] that require formal principles of economics instruction at the secondary level. To our knowledge, there is no empirical study to date that focuses specifically on the effectiveness of formal economics instruction in improving economic literacy of high school students in the state of California. This study partially fills that gap.",1
47,4,"Our work contributes to two important policy issues. The first regards the efficacy of high school economics in improving economic literacy. As we discuss below, evidence at the national level supports the view that a high school economics course improves students＊ performances on standardized economics tests. We sharpen the focus on this issue by adopting a single state, single county research design that includes a rich set of control variables from a survey that we designed, and from school records. The second policy issue concerns the effects of gender and ethnicity/ race on economic literacy. The literature, again mainly at the national level, finds significant gender differences in economic knowledge before an economics course is taken, but is inconclusive regarding gender effects on the learning of economics. A relatively scant literature finds differences in economic knowledge by race and ethnicity. We use our research design to study both gender and ethnicity effects on economic literacy both before and after students take their high school economics course. ",1
47,5,"Our focus on a single state and single county has a number of advantages for the empirical investigation. The reasons for variations in student achievement in economics are complex and are likely to be related to funding issues and administrative decisions regarding emphasis placed on economics instruction that vary considerable by state, and by counties within a state. Our research design effectively controls for many of these differences and allows us to better isolate the role of student characteristics on achievement.",1
47,6,"Although, as detailed in the section Study Methodology, Data, and Characteristics of the Sample, practical limitations were externally imposed on our research design, the demographics of Orange County are also important to this study. First, data from the California Department of Education (www.cde.ca.gov) for 2003每2004 show that Orange County had the second largest grade 12 enrollments in the state of California, accounting for over 8 percent of all high school seniors in the state. Second, whereas California is known for its diverse population, Orange County is one of the most racially and ethnically diverse populations in the state, with higher percentages of Asian and Hispanic students enrolled in 12th grade than the corresponding percentages for the state.",1
47,7,"Evidence from the literature supports the view that having students take an economics course is more effective in improving economic literacy than ＆＆infusing＊＊ economic content in the K-12 curriculum [Walstad 2001]. Using a sample of students from the second revision of the Test of Economic Literacy (TEL), Walstad and Soper [1989] report that students enrolled in an economics course scored higher on a post-test than students enrolled in social studies classes with no economic content, and scored higher than students enrolled in classes with some economic content. Becker and Walstad [1990], using the same data set, found that controlling for selection bias increased the marginal effect of the economics class on post-test performance. Walstad and Rebeck [2001a] and Lillydahl [1990], likewise, find that, nationwide, students enrolled in an economics course obtain the highest scores on the TEL multiple choice examination.",1
47,8,"Studies that explore differences in economic literacy by gender have also appeared in the literature. In a frequently cited article, Siegfried [1979] reviews the literature on a gender gap in students＊ performance. He reports that in most cases there is a statistically significant, although often small, male advantage over females in the understanding of economics measured at a specific point in time. More recent works have largely confirmed that a gender gap favoring males exists in students＊ point-intime measures of economic knowledge in high school [Watts 1987; Heath 1989; Walstad and Soper 1989; Evans 1992; Walstad and Robson 1997].",1
47,9,"Siegfried also suggests that strong evidence does not exist on the inferiority of women in learning economics, once other measurable factors affecting economic understanding and knowledge accumulation are considered. When a pretest每posttest design is used to measure improvements in economic knowledge, and therefore learning, often the female initial disadvantage does not increase overtime, implying that males and females learn at similar rates. Similar results emerge from more recent literature. Studies by Jackstadt and Grootaert [1980], Watts [1987], and Allgood and Walstad [1999] find insignificant effects of gender on learning economics. A different result concerning differentials in learning outcomes is obtained by Walstad and Soper [1989] and then replicated in a study by Becker and Walstad [1990]. The authors find that there are indeed statistically significant differences in learning rates favoring males.",1
47,10,"Less attention has been given to the effect of race and ethnicity on test scores. Evans [1992] and Harris and Kerby [1997] control for both students＊ race and ethnicity in their analyses. Evans finds that black students score significantly lower than whites, while Hispanics are at no significant disadvantage. Harris and Kerby find that black students are at a significant disadvantage with respect to white students, and that both Hispanics and Filipinos have significantly lower test scores than whites. Asians students score higher than white students, but the difference is not statistically significant. Walstad and Soper [1989] find that black students perform worse than other students on the TEL. In 2007, the US Department of Education＊s National Center for Education Statistics published results of their first national assessment of economic literacy in grade 12, reporting that a larger percentage of blacks and Hispanics performed below basic level than did whites.",1
47,11,"There are 15 school districts in Orange County, California, all under the auspices of a county superintendent. We contacted the county superintendent＊s office and obtained a complete list of high schools in Orange County, along with contact information for each district＊s superintendent. The assistant superintendent for the county sent a letter expressing support for our project to the offices of the districts＊ superintendents.",1
47,12,"We made repeated appeals to the districts＊ superintendents to enlist their support for the project. In the end, two large school districts, Fullerton and San Juan Capistrano, agreed to work with us. Seven schools from these districts participated in the study, and there were 1,343 students enrolled in the one-semester, senior year compulsory economics courses offered at these schools for Fall 2005. Virtually all the studies done on economic education at pre-college and college level suffer from similar limitations in their sampling procedures, regardless of the size of the sample or the financial resources available to the researchers [e.g., Walstad and Soper 1988, p. 28; 1989, p. 24]. It is also important to note that the 1,343 figure reported above represents the number of students enrolled in the classes surveyed as of the census date. As later explained, the actual number of students who attended classes and for whom we have complete data was smaller.",1
47,13,"Our key performance measures to assess initial economics knowledge and subsequent learning are students＊ scores on the TEL, administered to the students in the sample in the first week of their semester of economics course work (pretest) and again in the last week of the course (post-test). The TEL is a nationally-normed, standardized test developed by the National Council on Economic Education [Walstad and Rebeck 2001b], and it is the accepted standard for testing pre-college economic literacy. The test consists of 40 multiple choice questions on basic core, micro, macro, and international economics concepts.",1
47,14,"To analyze students＊ performance on the TEL examination, we needed information on students＊ characteristics. We gathered demographic, family background, and academic performance characteristics from a student questionnaire that we designed [Appendix A] and from official school records. From the questionnaire we obtained information about students＊ race, ethnicity, and gender, their primary language, hours they work per week at jobs outside of school, the number of hours per week they devote to their studies, and the educational background of their parents. From official schools＊ records we obtained students＊ academic (excluding physical education) grade point averages (GPAs) prior to the start of the Fall 2005 semester.2 From some schools we also obtained students＊ standardized mathematics and reading scores. As mentioned, the pretest was administered to students prior to the start of their mandated economics course. No student had received formal economics instruction prior to taking the pretest. Our survey instrument was administered during the first two weeks of classes.",1
47,15,"Table 1 presents descriptive statistics. The descriptive statistics are based on a sample of 514 students for whom we had complete information on test scores and survey responses to carry out the multiple regression analysis of pretest and post-test scores presented in the section Analysis of Test Scores. The reduction in sample size is caused primarily by students never attending the class, withholding information on individual questions, or by students being absent from class on the day the pretest, post-test, or survey were administered.",1
47,16,"The first column of Table 1 lists students＊ demographic characteristics, family background characteristics and academic performance and work effort characteristics, including pretest and post-test TEL scores. The second column of the table gives frequency distributions for the categorical variables and means and standard deviations for the continuous variables. As shown, our sample contains a larger proportion of females than males (53.9 percent vs 46.1 percent), with about 70 percent of the student population being white, 17.7 percent Hispanic, and 5.3 percent Asian. About 4 percent of the students in the sample report a language other than English for reading, writing, and speaking; 9 percent of our students are foreign born and 10.6 percent of them speak a language other than English at home. Our data indicate that a higher percentage of fathers are college educated than are mothers, and that 73 percent of the students in our sample live with both their mothers and fathers most of the time.",1
47,17,"The last part of Table 1 summarizes students＊ characteristics on academic performance, work effort, and test scores. The mean academic GPA is 3.02, with 65.4 percent of students reporting they took at least one advanced placement or honors class in high school. In addition, 21.2 percent of the students were enrolled in an economics class taught at the advanced placement level. Mean mathematics and reading scores are 246 (out of a possible 300) and 230 (out of a possible 300), respectively.4 Students, on average, devoted a little less than 9 hours per week to their studies and about 10.4 hours per week to work for pay. Finally, the TEL scores indicate that students＊ mean scores increased from 52.9 percent of questions answered correctly on the pretest to 65.2 percent of questions answered correctly on the post-test.",1
47,18,"Since both pretest scores and student characteristics＊ determining pretest scores are included in the post-test regression, we interpret the coefficients for the student characteristics in the post-test regression as the marginal impacts of these characteristics on post-test scores, net of their effects on pretest scores. That is, we are interested in how these variables affect the value-added from economics instruction.",1
47,19,"Table 2 provides information on pretest scores and changes in test scores by race and ethnicity, gender, and academic performance. The first two rows of the table show sample means for students＊ pretest scores and the difference between the pretest and post-test score organized by race and ethnicity. African-American students are excluded from this analysis because we lacked a sufficient number of observations to carry out our tests. Rows three and four, and rows five and six, respectively, provide the same information broken down by gender and by whether students had taken an advanced placement or honors class. Probability values for univariate tests of significance in each case are displayed in the table.",1
47,20,"Table 2 also shows that there are statistically significant, though small, gender differences in pretest scores. On average, male students outscore female students by about 3.5 percentage points. Walstad and Rebeck [2001b] report a 4 percentage point gender gap favoring males among students without formal economic education. Finally, students who reported taking at least one advanced placement or honors class performed better on the TEL than students who had not. Similar results are reported by Evans [1992] and Walstad and Rebeck [2001a, b].",1
47,21,"Turning first to the results on pretest scores in Column 1 of Table 3, we find, consistent with the univariate tests reported in Table 2, that Hispanic and Asian students＊ pretest scores are significantly lower than the TEL scores for whites, the reference category. Yet, in the multiple regression analysis, the white每Hispanic gap in scores falls noticeably (from about 11 percentage points in Table 2 to about 7 percentage points in Table 3). Thus, it appears that the lower performance of Hispanic students compared to white students can be explained in part by differences between the groups in family background, performance and work effort characteristics. Our results show a large negative effect for African-American students (11.12 percentage points), but we view this result and the result for Asian students with caution, as our subsamples of African-American and Asian students are small.",1
47,22,"The gender effects reported in Table 3 tell a different story. Column 1 gives a gender effect of 6.4 percentage points favoring males. This is 83 percent higher than the gender differential reported in Table 2. A likely reason for this result is that males lag behind females in academic performance characteristics, yet despite this disadvantage they outperform females on the TEL. Therefore controlling for academic performance characteristics increases the male每female gap in test scores.",1
47,23,"Additional results indicate that students who report English as their primary language for writing and speaking score about 5 percentage points higher on the pretest, and students who report living with both parents score about 3 percentage points higher. Academic performance is, as expected, an important predictor of success on the pretest: a one-point increase in academic GPA is associated with 9.12 percentage point increase in pretest scores. In addition, students taking an advanced placement economics class score nearly 4 percentage points higher on the pretest. The variable controlling for whether students ever had an advanced placement or honors class is insignificant in the pretest regressions.",1
47,24,"Adding math and reading scores to the pretest regression (Table 3, Column 2) does little to change the estimated ethnicity and gender effects reported in Column 1. A ten point increase in reading scores increases pretest scores by a little over 4 percentage points. Including mathematics and reading scores reduces the impact of academic GPA from 9.12 percentage points to 7.42 percentage points. The impact of being currently enrolled in advanced placement economics, on the other hand, increases from 3.88 percentage points to 5.78 percentage points.",1
47,25,"Our results confirm previous findings on the determinants of student＊s stock of economic knowledge in high school. As we indicated in the section The Literature, Watts [1987], Walstad and Soper [1989], Heath [1989], Evans [1992], all report statistically significant differences by gender favoring males, though, with the exception of Heath, our gender effects are larger. Previous studies also obtained results similar to ours for the effect of variables measuring academic ability, such as GPA or AP courses. Jackstadt and Grootaert [1980], for example, find that grade level, GPA, and holding a part-time job, are all variables that significantly affect students＊ scores. As for the effect of ethnicity on students＊ scores, Harris and Kerby find that both Hispanics and Filipinos have significantly lower test scores than whites (1.47 points and 2.34 points, respectively on multiple choice exams). If anything, our single county focus suggests even larger ethnicity and gender differences in pretest scores than those indicated in most of the previous studies, though we acknowledge that our results for Hispanic students, in particular, may be picking up an effect specific to Orange County.",1
47,26,"For the high school students in our sample, initial knowledge of economics is not strong. As indicated by descriptive statistics, white students obtained the highest pretest TEL scores (55.5 percent), followed by Asians (48.9 percent) and Hispanics (44.1 percent), and males outperformed females by about 3.5 percentage points (54.8 percent and 51.3 percent, respectively). When we analyze the determinants of pretest scores, we find significant differences by ethnicity and gender. For Hispanic students the gap with whites in pretest scores is reduced, but not eliminated, when we control for academic performance and family background characteristics.",1
47,27,"The gender differences we report on pretest scores are intriguing. The overall differences in initial economic literacy favoring males are small, yet the gap widens when we control for academic performance characteristics. Females seem to underachieve in economics relative to their performance in other subjects. One could speculate that more frequent exposure of young girls to the economic way of reasoning at younger ages could make a difference. In general, academic performance, as reflected in GPA and in standardized mathematics and reading scores, is an important determinant of pretest scores.",1
47,28,"Finally, we find evidence that teacher quality may be very important in determining students＊ learning. We show that the teacher-specific effects are, for the most part, large and statistically significant. While we cannot rule out that there may be common unobservable (or observable) student characteristics by classroom that lead to peer effects, we believe that teacher quality plays a significant role in determining changes in students＊ test scores.",1
47,29,"Our results by ethnicity and gender do suggest venues for effective policy intervention. The results indicate that raising the economic literacy of Hispanics to the level of whites has a lot to do with factors affecting the overall academic performance of Hispanics relative to whites. Thus, if the aim is to improve the economic literacy of Hispanics, attention should be given to improving learning for this group in all subjects, including economics, at younger ages. The fact that there is a white每Hispanic difference in pretest scores after controlling for academic performance characteristics leads us to speculate that there may be important differences between whites and Hispanics in early exposure to economic concepts, perhaps having to do with lower income and other background and community characteristics. Similarly, females enter 12th grade with less economic knowledge than their male peers, particularly relative to their overall academic performance.",1
47,30,"To conclude, our analysis of 12th graders＊ entry-level knowledge of economics, although limited in geographical scope, suggests that more should be done throughout the K-11 school curriculum to foster basic economic literacy. Since 1998, the California History/Social Science Standards do include an Economics Strand across the K-12 curriculum, therefore requiring ＆＆infusion＊＊ of basic economic concepts and economic way of thinking over the course of 11 school years, culminating in the one-semester economics course required for high school graduation. Despite the ＆＆infusion＊＊ requirements, we find that economic literacy among young Californians is not strong upon entering 12th grade. On the other hand, we do find that 12th grade formal economic instruction does improve students＊ economic literacy. ",1
48,1,Classical economists attached dominant importance to issues of capital accumulation and growth. It may be no exaggeration to say that this emphasis on growth and accumulation dates from Adam Smith＊s Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. It has been widely observed that in the Wealth of Nations Smith has a highly formal account of economic development in which some economic forces interact and lead a commercial economy to move forward in the dynamic process.,1
48,2,"Yet, this is only part of the story with regard to the issues of economic evolution. In order to understand it we also need to look at the study of history. For Smith, the study of history also remains a basic necessity for the science of man and society. The historical study becomes a tool with which to construct a coherent system of social science. In this regard it should be recalled that Smith provides a historical account of social progress from the rise and fall of feudal society to the emergence of modern European states in Book III of the Wealth of Nations.",1
48,3,"In his essay on the history of astronomy, Smith notes that science seeks to identify mechanisms that give power to event regularities between phenomena. In Smith＊s words, the mission of scientists is to find out ＆the connecting principles of nature＊ or ＆the invisible chains which bind together all these disjointed objects＊ (Smith 1980: 45). The same applies to moral philosophy. It is noted in the Wealth of Nations that moral philosophy is the ＆science which pretends to investigate and explain those connecting principles＊ (Smith 1776: 769). Complying with the task of scientists thus defined, Smith tried to uncover the ＆chains and mechanisms＊ or ＆connecting principles＊ from which it would be possible to draw inferences on events in the social arena. This is why today Smith＊s moral philosophy, which includes natural theology, ethics, jurisprudence, and economics, is often depicted as a system of social science.",1
48,4,"Indeed, this has led a number of commentators to support the view that Smith＊s historical account is to be understood, not as a form of idiographic approach but rather as that of nomothetic approach to history. This means that history is considered less as a body of work that deals with a narrative description based on the collection and arrangement of past events, and more as that which starts from a theoretical framework established in the beginning by which systematic examination may be made of main issues in history. It has been therefore pointed out that Smith＊s historical discourse proceeded ＆from the system to the facts,＊ not vice versa, and the use of historical evidence was made to illustrate and sustain his theory.",1
48,5,"What has been so interesting to Smithian scholars is that this led Smith to state strikingly that the actual course of economic development in Europe was ＆entirely inverted＊ (Smith 1776: 380). Indeed, Smith devoted the remaining chapters from two to four of Book III to accounting for why that divergence happened. This has led some of commentators to argue that Smith failed to reconcile historical experience with his theoretical argument in history.",1
48,6,"However, it is now important for the present purpose to observe that the theoretical history of progress depicted in the first chapter of Book III is built upon a kind of economic theoretical modeling with a set of institutional, legal and political conditions given or assumed as constant.",1
48,7,"There may be another, rather extended dimension to Smith＊s theoretical history of economic progress. That is to say, we may suppose that the nomothetic mode grounded in an economic modeling may be extended to a politico-economic modeling, in which the set of principles (such as the structure of legal rules and incentives) to be considered at the level of the polity can be introduced, thus allowing the interplay with economic forces. In our view, this is what Smith attempts through most of Book III and Book IV of the Wealth of Nations, although at a glance such a story of the theoretical history of economic change does not clearly come into view.",1
48,8,"Firstly, it needs to be recalled that, for Smith, political economy is not a subject that concentrates on purely economic questions with no political activities working on them. According to him, it was ＆a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator＊ (Smith 1776: 428) or the theory of natural jurisprudence that may be named today as a theory of the state. Natural jurisprudence was thought to be ＆a theory of the general principles which ought to run through and be the foundation of the laws of nations＊ (Smith 1759: 341).",1
48,9,"This observation implies that Smith may have a politico-economic model in economic history, where Smith＊s theories of the state and positive economics act as a subtheory respectively. As Smith＊s historical account of the actual progress in Europe shows, the politico-economic model tells us that while the polity and the economy interact in the system, any governmental actions, and legal institutions set up by public policy will surely affect economic performance, whether or not favorable or unfavorable.",1
48,10,"It should be borne in mind that Smith was well aware that there are a number of forces at work that will have effects on the stagnation and progress of wealth in the real historical process. Therefore, he often indicates that defense, culture, climate, terrain, and even chance might be factors that influence economic performance and social change.",1
48,11,"As it is well known, the principle of self-love or ＆the desire of bettering our condition＊ is especially noted as ＆a desire which, though generally calm and dispassionate, comes with us from the womb, and never leaves us till we go into the grave＊ (Smith 1776: 341). Smith therefore argues that this principle of human nature is the engine driving humans to bring about savings at the individual level and capital accumulation at the aggregate level, so that it helps lead to the higher employment and national income.",1
48,12,"Second, it ought to be observed that Smith incorporates into his account of economic history an analysis of institutional factors such as political rules, property rights and contracts, which are altogether run and enforced by the state. Actually, human institutions managed by the state are formal constraints to everyday life and so act as a primary agent of human interaction. For instance, a type of polity and a structure of property rights positioned in a just and proper way may allow individual actors to enjoy security for industry or have an incentive to economic activities, and thus seek a more productive use of limited resources.",1
48,13,"From Book III, Chapter 2 of the Wealth of Nations onwards, Smith describes the progress of wealth and the transition to the modern economy, which really happened in Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire. Smith states that what happened at that time was to see an agricultural stage. Therefore Smith＊s historical description starts from the evolutionary process of agriculture.",1
49,1,"This study aims at assessing to what extent institutional environment is responsible for worldwide differences in economic growth and economic development. To answer this question, we use an innovative approach based on a?new concept of the institutionsaugmented Solow model which is then estimated empirically using regression equations. The analysis covers 180 countries during the 1993每2012 period. The empirical analysis confirms a?large positive impact of the quality of institutional environment on the level of economic development. The positive link has been evidenced for all five institutional indicators: two indices of economic freedom (Heritage Foundation and Fraser Institute), the governance indicator (World Bank), the democracy index (Freedom House), and the EBRD transition indicator for post-socialist countries. Differences in physical capital, human capital, and institutional environment explain about 70每75% of the worldwide differences in economic development. The institutions-augmented Solow model, however, performs slightly poorer in explaining differences in the rates of economic growth: only one institutional variable (index of economic freedom) has a?statistically significant impact on economic growth.",1
49,2,"There are many factors that affect the pace of economic growth and the level of economic development, both from the theoretical and empirical perspective. Using one of the classifications, the factors can be divided into two groups: the demand-side and the supply-side determinants. The first group encompasses the components of aggregate demand, i.e. investment expenditures, government spending on goods and services, and net exports (consumption may be omitted because it is not an autonomous factor due to its direct dependence on output). The second group of factors includes the supplyside determinants which affect potential output; among these variables one may include physical capital, human capital, labor, and technology. Of course, both demand-side and supply-side variables can be more disaggregated, including various types of investments or government spending, or many more types of capital. All these factors (both demandside and supply-side) can be called direct ones because they immediately transform expenditures or inputs into output.",1
49,3,"Economic growth and economic development both depend, however, not only on these direct determinants but also on deep factors of production. Deep factors affect direct determinants and in this way they influence macroeconomic performance. Deep determinants are institutions that allow for interactions between output and measurable inputs.",1
49,4,"The role of institutions in the process of economic growth and economic development is enormous. However, when assessing the impact of institutions on economic growth, the following questions or problems arise: first, which institutions are the most important growth factors; and second, how to measure institutions quantitatively in order to include them in empirical studies. The difficulty in answering these questions implies that there is still much room for theoretical and empirical studies that examine the relationship between institutions and economic growth.",1
49,5,"The term ＆institution＊ is very broad. There are a? huge (perhaps almost infinite) number of variables that represent some kinds of institutions. For example, Sulejewicz [2009] provides many different concepts of institutions. Persson [2010] states that institutions are the rules of the game; some are upheld by law, others by mutual and spontaneous consent and a?few by the (brute) force of privileged elites. Some institutions are informal, such as trust and commitment, while others〞the limited liability corporation for example〞needed coordinated action by lawmakers to get established. Rodrik [2007] points out that markets require institutions such as property rights, regulatory institutions (regulating conduct in goods, services, labor, assets, and financial markets), fiscal and monetary institutions for macroeconomic stabilization, institutions for social insurance, and institutions of conflict management (e.g. rule of law, a?highquality judiciary, representative political institutions, free elections, independent trade unions, social partnerships, and institutionalized representation of minority groups).",1
49,6,"Research hypotheses and the objectives of the paper refer to the following aspects. The first aim of the paper is to extend the neoclassical growth model to include institutions. Second, the study aims at assessing empirically the impact of institutions on economic development of the countries in the world. Third, the paper examines the empirical impact of institutions on the worldwide level of economic growth. Our fourth goal is to estimate the production function based on these results.",1
49,7,"Since it is impossible to include in one empirical analysis all the possible types of institutions, it is necessary to introduce some constraints as to the number and the type of institutional indicators. Hence, the study focuses on the following indices that represent various areas of institutional environment: index of economic freedom, governance indicator, democracy index, and transition indicator. Economic development is measured by the level of GDP per capita at PPP while economic growth is its growth rate. Our study covers 180 countries but the particular models may be estimated based on a?lower number of countries, depending on data availability.",1
49,8,"The paper is composed of five points. In the following point, which appears after the introduction, we present the methodology by providing a?concise description of the Mankiw-Romer-Weil model and the institutions-augmented Solow model, and we review the literature, describing other selected empirical studies on institutions-growth nexus. The next section describes the data used. Then, the results of the analysis are presented and discussed. The last point is the conclusion.",1
49,9,"In this section we compare the Solow model extended for human capital, i.e. the Mankiw-Romer-Weil (MRW) model, with our own concept of the institutions-augmented Solow model. For the sake of conciseness, only the most important assumptions and implications are presented here; some issues are examined more deeply by Pr車chniak [2013].",1
49,10,"Equation (21) shows that, according to the institutions-augmented Solow model, economic growth depends on institutions as well as standard factors. The better institutions are, the more rapid is economic growth. Estimating equation (21) using linear regression allows us to check empirically the impact of institutions on economic growth. Of course, some assumptions as to the specification of the regression model and the methods of estimation have to be imposed. For example, Bia?owolski, Kuszewski, and Witkowski [2010] assume that all the macroeconomic relationships are linear.",1
49,11,"This way of finding economic growth determinants, namely the estimation of the regression equation, is not the only way of finding the variables that affect economic growth. Another type of research aiming at verifying growth determinants is the growth accounting exercise. Growth accounting is an empirical exercise aimed at calculating how much economic growth is caused by changes in measurable factor inputs (such as labor, physical capital, or human capital) and in the level of technology. The unexplained part of economic growth, measured as a?residual, is called the Solow residual and it is interpreted as the proxy of technical progress or the increase in total factor productivity (TFP). Estimation of the regression equation and carrying out the growth accounting framework involve different econometric methodology and they cannot be directly compared because based on this study, we cannot easily state which portion of the Solow residual is attributed to institutions and which to elements other than institutions. For the studies in which a?growth accounting exercise is carried out, see e.g. Rapacki and Pr車chniak [2006].",1
49,12,"Since there is no unique method to measure institutions, in the literature we find a?lot of empirical studies that analyze the relationship between institutions and economic growth (or economic development). There number of these studies is too high to discuss even a?small portion of them in one paper. For the sake of conciseness, we limit ourselves to presenting a?brief comparison of selected empirical studies in Table 1. In the quoted studies, the authors analyze the impact of institutional environment on macroeconomic performance. Most of the institutional indicators are related to economic freedom, the level of democracy, and political stability.",1
49,13,"The literature review shows a?huge diversity of the methods of analysis, including various theoretical models, various institutional indicators, various samples of countries and time periods, as well as various ways of econometric modeling. Despite the fact that some clear tendencies appear (such as the positive impact of economic freedom on economic growth), some other questions are not yet resolved (e.g., whether the impact of institutions on growth is linear or nonlinear). Hence, there is still much room for the empirical studies on the relationship between institutions and economic growth. In this paper we would like to test the appropriateness of the institutions-augmented Solow model in explaining differences in the rates of economic growth and in the levels of economic development and, based on these results, to estimate the macroeconomic production function.",1
49,14,"In this section, we verify the validity of the institutions-augmented Solow model to explain the differences in economic development and economic growth between the countries. We begin the analysis with the determinants of economic development. Then we switch to the analysis of economic growth determinants.",1
49,15,"The data in Table 2 indicate that the institutions-augmented Solow model performs extraordinarily well in explaining worldwide differences in income levels. Regardless of the institutional indicator, all the regression equations have very high R-squares while estimated coefficients, in terms of their sign and significance, correspond to our expectations and the theoretical analysis. For example, variant A?indicates that differences in physical capital accumulation, human capital accumulation, population growth, and the scope of economic freedom (measured by the Heritage Foundation index of economic freedom) explain about three-fourths of worldwide differences in economic development. All the explanatory variables are statistically significant (but the sign for population growth is, contrary to the theory, positive). If we use another index of economic freedom as the institutional indicator, compiled by Fraser Institute, the results are similar in terms of explaining worldwide income level differences (R-square is about three-fourths); physical capital, however, becomes an insignificant variable, but human capital and institutions retain their significance. In variant C, in which the institutional variable is the world governance indicator compiled by World Bank, the results are similar to those in variant B (high R-square, significant explanatory variables except physical capital which is completely insignificant).",1
49,16,"According to the theoretical analysis, the relationship between the rate of economic growth and the initial GDP per capita level should be negative. Such a? phenomenon confirms the existence of convergence. The appearance of the catching-up effect leads to diminishing income differences between countries. As regards the other economic growth determinants, the impact of physical capital and human capital accumulation as well as that of institutions on the rate of economic growth is positive while the relationship between population growth and output dynamics should be rather negative.",1
49,17,"Hence, our analysis shows that the Solow model extended for institutional variables is better in explaining worldwide differences in economic development than differences in economic growth rates. This results from the fact that the institutional environment as well as the other two variables representing inputs (investment rate and human capital accumulation) are related to the supply side of the economy and influence potential output to a? large extent. Indeed, the theoretical analysis of the Solow model associates output with potential output. Meanwhile, economic growth rates of the countries in the world, in our opinion, are influenced by many demandside factors as well as the other forces implying that they do not well reflect fluctuations in potential output. Hence, our institutions-augmented Solow model better explains differences in economic development than in the rates of economics growth. Another explanation refers to the fact that institutional variables exhibit rather long run effects. The current level of economic development is the result of a? long run behavior of a? given economy and that is why institutional variables may explain it well. Conversely, economic growth, even averaged over a?number of years, does not reveal long-run tendencies and that is why institutional variables may provide a?weak explanation.",1
49,18,"When interpreting the results, the theoretical causal relationship between explanatory variables and the level of economic development is assumed to be as follows: past values of explanatory variables affect the current state of development. In reality, many macroeconomic relationships have mutual causality, which is partly caused by the fact that some variables are endogenous by nature. For example, rich countries may also have greater opportunities to save, to invest in human capital, and to have friendly regulations and institutions just because they are rich. An endogenic approach requires, however, more in-depth analysis, with more advanced econometric techniques, which could be a?subject for further research.",1
49,19,"The above formulas seem to yield slightly contradictory results. The first one emphasizes a?significant role of human capital in the process of economic development while the latter one gives more importance to physical capital accumulation. This outcome may be explained by the fact that the former formula was obtained based on the determinants of economic development. In explaining differences in economic development, human capital is more important. The level of economic well-being is the result of the long-term process of economic growth which depends to a?large extent on human capital accumulation over the past decades. Therefore, the countries which are human capital abundant achieve higher levels of economic development.",1
49,20,"On the other hand, in the process of medium-term economic growth physical capital seems to be more important. It is investment in physical capital rather than investment in human capital which leads to an immediate acceleration of economic growth. The effects of human capital accumulation take more time and that is why in the process of economic growth physical capital is a?more significant variable. This view is also shared by some models of economic growth (e.g. the Uzawa-Lucas model) which states that the pace of economic growth of a?given less-developed country depends on whether this country is physical capital scarce or human capital scarce.",1
49,21,Our results imply that institutions are important in forming GDP regardless of the model. Institutional elasticity of output equals 0.55 or 1.05 on average indicating that institutions are one of the most important factors determining output. Most of the individual models also confirm this view.,1
50,1,"An economic man, i.e., the leading role in economic ethics, has been deeply investigated in our study considering a human being＊s economic behavior and the hypotheses for an economic man in traditional economics based on M. Weber＊s and S. N. Bulgakov＊s Christian economic man. Among various channels to study business ethics and economic ethics, we chose the definition of an economic man given by Weber and Bulgakov to review a hypothesis about a rational economic man in economics and discussed L. von Mises＊s and A. Sen＊s contentions for an economic man＊s substantive freedom and innermost being. The issue deserved to be further investigated by scholars who concern business ethics and economic ethics consists in reconciling egotism and altruism commonly embedded in an economic man＊s heart and boosting more altruistic economic men.",1
50,2,"In the late 19th century, China faced the capitalist powers of Europe and America and the challenge of Western civilization. China first took note of the West when it was unable to counter its military might in the form of ships and guns. It then observed the advantages of laws and institutions of the Western capitalist countries, and finally started to realize how it would affect its own cultural heritage and civilization. Therefore, Neo-Confucianism reinvents the concept of ＆＆external enrichment＊＊ of traditional Confucianism, and by understanding its transitional process from the ＆＆internal tradition＊＊ to ＆＆external enrichment＊＊ proposed by Confucianism, it hopes to harmoniously blend Confucianism, capitalism, and democracy. Similarly, when Peter the Great westernized Russia, the amalgamation of Russian and Western civilizations was an important issue for the Russian educated circles. In the early 20th century, Russia chose the path paved by Lenin＊s Bolsheviks, and the issues of the ＆＆westernized＊＊ 21st century Russia (how to properly reconcile Western civilization and the inherent Russian culture and thus create a more efficient and moral capitalist market economy) and the mature and incorruptible democracy had yet to be proposed by Russia. Such a study is well worth the attention of academia.",1
50,3,"In 1950s, Pye (1982), Mead (2001), Almond and Verba (1963), Lipset (2001), McClelland (1987), and others had made significant contributions to the foregoing research approaches. From 1970 to 1980, several Asian countries became influenced by Confucian culture, especially after the economic take-off of the Four Asian Tigers (i.e., Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan). Confucian ethics and culture in economic development played an important role in national schools and attracted scholars such as Landes (1998), Fukuyama (1995), Huntington (1993), Porter (1990), Radelet and Sachs (1998), and so on, resulting in the accumulation of considerable research data. Since the 1990s, culture and economic development and culture and political development have been topics of considerable research. As Confucian ethics is a major source of Chinese culture, Russian culture is also heavily influenced by religious culture and ethics of the Eastern Orthodox Church. However, there have not been many studies on the impact of and the interaction between the Russian Orthodox ethics culture and economic development. It is interesting and worthy of more research to observe the operation of Russian-style capitalism influenced by the Eastern Orthodox Church culture rooted in ethical considerations.",1
50,4,"Therefore, this study hopes to utilize Amartya Sen＊s economic ethics theory as an analytical tool in order to develop Russia＊s capitalist market economic ethics based on the comparative economic ethics of Protestantism and the Eastern Orthodox Church. The culture and tradition of the Russian Orthodox Church has in fact made a profound impact on the development of Russia. A. Leroy-Beaulieu devoted a third of his classic ＆＆The Empire of the Tsars and the Russians＊＊ to the influence of the Eastern Orthodox Church on Russian history (Leroy-Beaulieu 2000). J. F. Hecker spoke about the ＆＆soul＊＊ of Russian people in his ＆＆ Religion under the Soviets＊＊ where he called Russians the ＆＆apostles of God＊＊ (Bogonostzy) and ＆＆those who yearn for God＊＊ (Bogoiskately) (Hecker 1994, p. 30).",1
50,5,"Furthermore, this study mainly focuses on the economic system of the Russian capitalist market and the Eastern Orthodox Church＊s ethical considerations in business management. It also extends Max Weber＊s ethical reflections on the capitalist economic system in his masterpiece ＆＆ The Protestant Ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism＊＊ , a s well as examines the relationship between the religiousrooted cultural phenomenon, economic development, and business operations.",1
50,6,"In addition, Bulgakov mentioned in his ＆＆Eastern Orthodox Church〞The Orthodox Dogma＊＊ the inevitable branding of ＆＆economic man＊＊ in religions, where an internal relation within religions and economic activities exist in the human soul, and that such relations are indeed the most interesting topic in Economics. He furthermore pointed out that the types of economic man in Christianity can be divided into Puritan economic man, Lutheran economic man, Reformed economic man, the Quakers, and other innovative types of economic man, as well as discusses about the Eastern Orthodox Church type of economic man. Therefore, it is essential in this study to examine the relationship between the Eastern Orthodox Church economic man and the development in the capitalist market economy, and the differences to the other types of economic man.",1
50,7,"In ＆＆The Development of Economic Ethics and Sen＊s Claim of Economic Ethics＊＊ section, economic ethics and economic system are reflected from perspectives of Sen＊s human substantive freedom, capability development, and lifestyle options. There among Sen＊s words are implied meanings of an economic man based on his statement of freedom an economic man based on his statement of freedom. As the concept economic man links up the paper, it is discussed again in the concluding section.",1
50,8,"In contrast to other theologians, Bulgakov was not only a contemporary well-known Russian Orthodox theologian but an economist having taught in both the Lomonosov Moscow State University and the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv and specialized in Marxist economics but gradually inclined Orthodox theology and become an Orthodox priest in 1918. In 1922, Bulgakov expelled by the Soviet government was exiled to Paris, France, founded the Institute Saint-Serge, and served as a professor teaching dogmatics until 1944 when he passed away. As an economist and a theologian, Bulgakov investigated various issues such as Orthodox ethics, alternative economic system, and economic development based on M. Weber＊s Christian economic ethics. His ideology enlightened modern business ethics and capitalist economic ethics. In this course for capitalist economic ethics, we will present Bulgakov＊s lifetime, academic courses, and ideological and theoretical contributions hereinafter.",1
50,9,"As a pious Orthodox Christian since childhood, Bulgakov who was born in a hereditary Russian Orthodox priest＊s family gradually became an atheist and a Marxist in an ordinary high school after leaving the original missionary school. He was generally recognized as a typical specialist of Marxism because of his monograph, ＆＆Production in a Capitalist Market＊＊, published in 1896. In virtue of effects of I. Kant and F. W. J. von Schelling, Bulgakov returning from Western Europe in 1901 had profoundly reviewed Marxist economics, investigated the issue that the rule of concentrated production in Marxist economics contradicted the rural production in his Master＊s thesis, ＆＆Capitalism and Agriculture＊＊, and further proselytized himself that the human life or a society was based on absolute values, i.e., true, good, and beautiful, rather than material. Accordingly, he published the monograph, ＆＆From Marxism to Idealism＊＊ to elaborate his ideological change in 1903. In this book, Bulgakov confessed he was a pure social scientist in the beginning of his academic career but had no choice but to explore righteousness and truth in the human society and further existence of the God during investigating foundation of the social system. Against this background, the relationship between Christian ethics and economy or society became one major issue in his research (Lossky 1952, pp. 192每195).",1
50,10,"Bulgakov continued the concept of man-God and investigated properties of pseudo-Christianity in materialistic atheism and Marx＊s socialism, for example, the prophecy for development of socialism and destiny of capitalism appeared to be eschatology in Christian theology, the called proletariat on a special mission was like the God＊s chosen people possessing vocations, and the capital was Satan, in his two assays, ＆＆Pristine Christianity and Last Socialism＊＊ in 1909 and ＆＆Apocalypse and Socialism＊＊ in 1910 (Lossky 1952, pp. 200每202). In the purport of economic ethics, Bulgakov argued Marx＊s socialism or the so-called atheist pseudo-religion was based on self-righteous man-God, who analogized oneself to the Christ or a saint but was hostile to Christianity as well as God-man saints, and this man-God was contrary to Christian economic man with unique personality and soul.",1
50,11,"The human economic behaviors were also investigated in Bulgakov＊s dissertation, ＆＆Philosophy of Economy: the World as Household＊＊, in addition to the concept of an economic man. Bulgakov considered correlation between labor and the realistic world as the object of economic activities: economy was one bridge rigidly joining a person and the realistic world in which a living person consumed and was involved but not reached by a dead who lost capability to communicate with the world; a person＊s renaissance and immortality in Christian view implied resumption of capability to consume in the realistic world; production was labor rights and responsibilities fulfilled by one person in the realistic world (Bulgakov 2000; Valliere 2000, pp. 253每278).",1
50,12,"In terms of discussions about economic ethics for the whole economic system and operation following the concept of Christian economic man, those issues hereinbefore were further elaborated by Bulgakov in assays, e.g., ＆＆The Soul of Socialism＊＊ (1932每1933) and ＆＆Social Teaching in Modern Russian Orthodox Theology＊＊ (1934) and the monograph, ＆＆The Orthodox Church＊＊ i n ＆＆ Orthodox Church and Economic Life＊＊ for the doctrine of the Russian Orthodox Church (1935). With the identity of an economist and a Russian Orthodox theologian, Bulgakov was known as a Christian socialist investigating correlation between Christianity and socialism and devoting himself to Orthodox Action by cooperating with Berdyaev in Paris and contended socialism was soulless (Williams 1999, pp. 229每236). In Bulgakov＊s thinking pattern of a Christian economic man, an economic man＊s properties in Christian implications followed by the Orthodox style and then the foundation of economic ethics in socialist as well as capitalist economic systems by Christian view were discussed sequentially. ",1
50,13,"The examination of economic growth in Economics in fact stems from Adam Smith＊s ＆＆An Inquiry into the Nature and Cause of the Wealth of Nations＊＊, and J. M. Keynes＊ ＆＆The General Theory of Employment, Interest and the Money＊＊ further inspired and intensified academia＊s reexamination of economic growth. R. F. Harrod, E. D. Domar, R. M. Solow, N. Kaldor, J. Tobin et al. examine economic growth based on labor production, capital increase, and advances in production technology.",1
50,14,"On the other hand, the Supply-Side School emphasizes on the lifting of government control, lowering of taxes, and the curbing of inflation to improve the aggregate supply function in order to enhance economic growth rate. However, the research on economic growth has shifted after Amartya Sen won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1998, and further attracted academic attention to the ethical and moral factors associated with economic development.",1
50,15,"Sen stressed that economic development was based on the elevated state of substantive freedom entitled to man, so economic development could only be possible when any factors that jeopardized free will were eliminated (Sen 2000, pp. 3每4). He also advocated critical thinking in the nature of Economics, for it＊s the contributions of economists such as Sir William Petty, Leon Walras, Francois Quesnay, David Ricardo, Augustine Cournot, etc., who tackled Economics with logics and engineering awareness that kindled the beginning of engineering analysis. Similarly, the association between Economics and ethics was only established when ethical issues were heavily weighted in the economic works of people like Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, and Francis Edgeworth (Sen 1987; Evensky 2007, pp. 253每282).",1
50,16,"The issue of man＊s ＆＆freedom＊＊ has been greatly valued by Christianity and its various divisions, namely the Eastern Orthodox Church, Catholicism, Protestantism, and others. Questions such as ＆＆who is man?＊＊ and ＆＆what is the relationship between man and God?＊＊ surface whenever human freedom comes to mind. Christianity usually uses ＆＆Imago Dei＊＊ from Chap. 1 verses 26每27 in ＆＆Genesis＊＊ of the Old Testament to explain who man is (Ott and Otte 2005, p. 145). So some of human＊s inherent characteristics, such as rationale, free will, and morality, are used to explain man＊s mirror image of God and the special relationship between man and his creator. In this case, man is the reflection, interlocutor, and contracting agent of God (Ott and Otte 2005, p. 145). Catholic theologian Karl Rahner considered man the receiver of Word of God ＆＆Ho ?rer des Wortes＊＊ as to describe the relationship between man and God (Rahner 1969; Rahner and Rahner 1962). However, can man＊s mirror image of God, after it was destroyed by Adam, only be restored through salvation? Or although man is a sinner, can man＊s mirror image of God remain intact and still be used as a link to God＊s grace through salvation? Or did man＊s mirror image of God only come into existence after the Original Sin, parts damaged, and parts intact? ",1
50,17,"Under the uncertainty and dilemma of such ＆＆limited freedom＊＊, Luther talked about Christians＊ virtue in having faith. Their faith leads to Christians believing in their own salvation, and thus having the freedom to complete what they supposedly need to do within their environment without coercion in performing sacred deeds for the mere purpose of pleasing God or gaining his recognition. Those without faith are deemed worrisome, troubled, and unhappy (Althaus and Schultz 1972, pp. 37每39). Therefore, salvation is only achieved by waiting for God wholeheartedly and completely trusting in God, as well as abandoning all self-directed activities (Althaus and Schultz 1972, p. 55; Brendler 1991; Hummel 2003). It is thus at the end of his life and after he is redeemed that man can be free to serve God.",1
50,18,"The uniqueness of Eastern Orthodox Theology lies in the fact that Orthodox theologians are constantly reminding the West that a large number of Christian religious rites and beliefs are derived from the East, because most of the early churches were located in the East, ＆＆Ex Oriente Lux＊＊ ! Second, the Greek language accurately expresses Christian doctrine, and they believe that the Latin terminology cannot master the subtle differences in concepts expressed in Greek theology (Pelikan 1974, pp. 19每25; Geanakoplos 1966, pp. 1每2; Rogosh 1948, pp. 24每26; Baum and Dietmar 2003, pp. 7每10).",1
50,19,"Sen developed a theory of economic development that embarks upon the relationship between human freedom and development. When man is in possession of true freedom, he is able to access and develop his talents in order to become a member of a certain group, profession or status, such as doctors, soldiers, volunteers, and so on. Sen defined this status and identity as ＆＆being＊＊ (Dai 2008, p. 53) which is different from the extensive religious concepts of ＆＆calling＊＊ or ＆＆Beruf＊＊ proposed by Weber. Weber mentioned the desire of Calvinist Puritans to become Berufsmenschen in order to reach the Kingdom of God, with which they answer God＊s calling by following asceticism and re-shaping the world. Weber believed that when an employer faces these voluntary workers with such high productivity, he can effectively put to use this capitalist ＆＆labor productivity＊＊. However, after the capitalist mode of production has replaced humans with machines, and the Enlightenment has inherited asceticism, the concept of Calling (Beruf) was translated into economic impulses and the pursuit of wealth, without ethical religious implications or spiritual associations (Weber 1958, p. 124). Therefore, after asceticism had given birth to capitalism, it collapsed itself slowly again in capitalism.",1
50,20,"Since Bulgakov considered man the Logos and the creator of this economic world, and that Christian religion holds the characteristics of asceticism, he proposed a merger between the role of Logos man plays in this world and asceticism, as well as between the responsibility of governing and abandoning the world. The new economic man motivated by this new labor mechanism could increase labor productivity (Bulgakov 1995, pp. 111每116). So, the distinction between Bulgakov＊s ＆＆homo economicus＊＊ (economic man) and Calvinist ＆＆Berufsmench＊＊ (man work in a calling) is evident. While ＆＆homo economicus＊＊ possesses ascetic nature, the man of ＆＆homo economicus＊＊ exists only in the identity of Logos, who collaborates and bonds with the Holy Spirit to help with the deification of the world. Man is an intimate partner of God, he assists the sacrament of God and governs the world after Creation. The ＆＆Berufsmensch＊＊ assumes the profession of ＆＆Beruf＊＊ (calling), he is dedicated and hardworking, and believes himself to be the chosen one who will be rewarded with an eternal life. He believes labor and diligence are his duties to God, and regards his work as a lifetime mission bestowed by God upon him.",1
50,21,"The Eastern Orthodox concept of the new economic man defines man as the Logos of the economic world. Man is assigned by God to govern and to create, he is endowed with labor rights and obligations to participate in God＊s mission of world divinization. In this scenario, the ＆＆instrumental freedoms＊＊ which give way to economic convenience and freedom, as well as basic human rights and economic rights to free trade in the market seems advantageous. So, if the Russian government can fully utilize the development strategy proposed by Sen＊s five ＆＆instrumental freedoms＊＊ to create a good environment and safeguard our freedom, etc., it should be most beneficial to Russia, including to its overall economic development.",1
50,22,"Referring to Bulgakov＊s Christian economic man, we studied the correlation between human substantive freedom or human economic behavior and an economic system in Sen＊s arguments. In addition, we investigated other concepts such as human freedom in theology; the God＊s calling to human beings, predestination, justification, mysticism, deification, and economic ethics of one economic system while researching Weber＊s man working in a calling under Lutheranism and Calvinism.",1
50,23,"As to Weber＊s ＆＆The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism＊＊ published in ＆＆Archiv f ? ur Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik＊＊ from 1904 to 1905 (Parsons 1958, p. ix), Williams (1997, p. 501) argued that Bulgakov＊s attitude to reject Marxism was elaborated in his statements for the economic man from 1903 to 1911. In fact, Bulgakov＊s dissertation, ＆＆Philosophy of Economy: the World as Household＊＊ (1912) and other essays including ＆＆The Unfading Light＊＊ (1917) and ＆＆The Soul of Socialism＊＊ , ＆＆ Social Teaching in Modern Russian Orthodox Theology＊＊ , and ＆＆The Orthodox Church＊＊ (1932每1935) referred to the concept of an economic man, particularly his concept of a Christian economic man undoubtedly inspired by Weber. In this regard, Bulgakov also gave ideas of various Christian economic men as regards Catholicism, Orthodox Church, Puritan, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Quakers. Weber＊s man working in a calling could be referred as to Bulgakov＊s Christian economic man. However, this viewpoint categorized in theology did not attract much attention in contrast to the economic man defined in traditional economics. As such, it can be said that a new research domain is activated because of this new concept about the economic man defined with new significance.",1
50,24,"Sen＊s research transiting a rational and self-interested economic man to a free economic man still did not reach an economic man＊s soul or innermost being which was specified in von Mises＊s analyses for a human being＊s economic behavior at Chap. 1 and free will at Chap. 3 and considered as an essential ingredient in analyses of a human being＊s economic behavior (von Mises 2006). In this regard, von Mises＊s economic man got close to Bulgakov＊s Christian economic man or Weber＊s man working in a calling which was referred to as a Calvinist economic man from Bulgakov＊s viewpoint.",1
50,25,"The correlation between an economic man in an economic system and religious ethics attracted much attention from Bulgakov and Weber: Weber emphasized effects of Calvinist economic ethics on an economic man, which was further upgraded to an economic man in Christianity by Bulgakov. Both Bulgakov and Weber referred to the soulless economic man: Bulgakov believed a materialist economic man in Marxism would be soulless; Weber argued there was no man working in a calling except soulless ones losing Protestant ethics in the last stage of capitalism.",1
51,1,The purpose of this paper is to clarify the presuppositions implied in a recent debate about the possibility of economic planning using computing models and to provide additional arguments relevant to the economic calculation debate.,1
51,2,"The paper provides additional arguments supporting the thesis that computation in a planned economy implies computation with infinite uncountable domains. In addition, this paper rejects the objections raised by some earlier researchers in 2007 in response to Murphy＊s theses.",1
51,3,"The possibility of computation and calculation in an economic system is of great practical importance. Institutional settlements and policies are not indifferent to the economic calculation problem. Different institutional settings can hinder the very possibility of economic calculation and rational allocation of resources. From this perspective, the conclusions of economic calculation debate are crucial. The economist＊s and philosopher＊s criteria used to define institutions and policies must take into account this important question of the possibility of computation and calculation in an economic system.",1
51,4,"Computability in an economic system deals primarily with the question whether economic problem can be solved in the framework of the computability theory. Modern computing devices often seem to possess infinite capacity for calculation, and sometimes we assume that, given enough time and resources, we might use computers to solve any problem, including the economic problem.",1
51,5,"The economic problem can be briefly described as the problem of the rational allocation of resources in an economic system. Each person, even if he/she has autarchic existence, has to deal with the problem of the rational allocation of the resources, mostly because in almost all cases there are much more needs or desires than resources available to satisfy these needs or desires. The most suggestive example is the problem of the rational allocation of time. The time is a scarce resource for all of us and the rational allocation of this resource means to allocate the time according to the importance of the objectives we have.",1
51,6,"In his argument, von Mises sustains that in an economic system based on collective forms of property, even if the planner has all the relevant information[2], the economic calculation is still impossible. For the sake of the argument, von Mises presupposes that the planner holds all the technological knowledge available in his period and a complete inventory of the production factors. Also, a number of experts give him reports with complete information, and, miraculously, all the individuals from the society agreed upon their ultimate common ends. But even in these conditions, the planner has an insoluble problem: how to decide between the infinite variety of projects and means that can be employed for the fulfillment of the chosen ends in the most advantageous manner[3]. For example, if the planner wants to build a house, there are multiple methods to do that, and each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages regarding the final result, the consumed resources, and the period of production. How to choose the appropriate method? In order to do that, he/she has to compare very different things, such as the time for production, the consumed resources (possibly more useful for other alternative projects), the productivity of the different tools and machines, the quality of the building materials, labor, and so on. ",1
51,7,"In a complex economy, the production methods are extremely varied. The means of production are neither completely specific, nor absolutely non-specific. If all the means of production were either specific, either non-specific, the decision about the method of production and about the means to be utilized would be a purely technological problem, not an economic problem (von Mises, 1998, pp. 207-8). From this point of view, even in a simple economy, a rational choice between heterogonous means and methods of production would be possible only with some limits[4]. In the case of a complex economy, the main difficulty is not to decide about the final goods to be produced. Even in a socialist economy, this problem is not so complicated. It can be decided approximately if 1,000 hl of wine are better then 800 hl of wine or if, instead of 500 hl of oil, 1,000 hl are to be preferred. After this decision is taken, from this point onward, the real, insoluble problem (for the planned economy) occurs: choosing the most advantageous means and methods of production in order to fulfill the ends (von Mises, 1990, p. 13).",1
51,8,"The importance of the market prices (i.e. the expression of the goods value in terms of a common exchange medium) is that they make possible the rational decision regarding the means and methods of production, given the multitude of available variants. Therefore, the monetary calculation based on market prices formed in a system of private property, where entrepreneurs bids for the goods they need (final goods and intermediate goods) is finally, from this perspective, the solution of the economic problem of the rational allocation of resources.",1
51,9,"Abba Lerner and Oskar Lange recognized that market prices are very important in economic calculation, but they rejected the idea that free market based on private property is a necessary condition for economic calculation and sustained that planners could mimic any market outcome. Lange (1936, 1937) developed an argument in favor of market socialism. He stated that there are three kinds of data, necessary for calculation: individual preferences, prices and knowledge about available resources. An important difference between von Mises and Lange is the conception about prices. For Lange, the determination of the prices is possible knowing the preferences of the individuals and the amount of available resources. He sustains a trial and error procedure or a t? atonnement solution for finding ※correct§, equilibrium prices of goods. For von Mises, the determination of the prices can take place only in a private property based system, in a market economy.",1
51,10,"According to the revised version sustained for example by Lavoie (1981), von Mises＊s critique of socialism is not invalidated by the advocates of the market socialism. Basically, Lange presupposed, when settled down his solution, the Walrasian model of static general equilibrium. Instead, von Mises and Austrian outlined the entire problem of economic calculation in a different framework: the dynamic adjustment and discovery in the face of continuously changing conditions (technologies, preferences). According to Lavoie, von Mises never denied that in static conditions the economic calculation in socialism could work, but this is irrelevant for the real world. From this perspective, economic calculation in an economy based on collective forms of properties is not possible in principle and the computation argument is downplayed. The problem is not that there are too many equations to be solved, but that the equations could not be set up from the beginning (Lavoie, 1981, 1985).",1
51,11,"In the next section, we will analyze a recent debate about the limits of computability in an economic system based on central planning and collective forms of property. Robert Murphy, that adopted the revised version position in economic calculation debate, formulated a new argument in order to support the thesis that, in principle, economic problem cannot be solved using computational models (Murphy, 2006). Cottrell et al. (2007a, b) adopted the standard version position concerning economic calculation debate and contested Murphy＊s argument.",1
51,12,"Murphy＊s argument is not formulated in one stroke. First, he stresses the fact that, in the market process, entrepreneurs innovate continuously. Therefore, the list of goods to be produced is always an open one. So, if the central planning unit has to mimic the market processes, it is necessary to take into account all possible future goods and commodities that can appear on the market (all possible fiction books, movies, services and also all the intermediate goods). Therefore, the central planner must have the corresponding lists of the prices of all final goods and also implicitly of all intermediate goods necessary for producing the consumer goods.",1
51,13,"In order to show why the number of prices is uncountably infinite, it is useful to consider beforehand an application of Cantor＊s diagonal argument in proving the existence of an uncountable set (Hunter, 1996).",1
51,14,"Cottrell et al. (2007a, b) that R. Murphy does not succeed to prove nor that the set of market prices is uncountable, neither that it is infinite. Their thesis is that the number of all commodities is necessarily countable, because ※every commodity is produced from a discrete and finite amount of other commodities, and base commodities (typically raw materials) are composed of finite numbers of atoms.§ Every commodity could be represented by some archetype, giving it a unique integer identifier, based on aG ? odel number composed from the number of atoms of each element it contains. Finally, they concluded that since there are only a finite number of elements, all possible finite combinations and also all possible commodities can be enumerated. It follows that the set of the commodities is finite and countable. Therefore, if the set of commodities is countable, so is the set of corresponding prices (Cottrell et al., 2007a, b).",1
51,15,"However, Cottrell et al. (2007a, b, p. 3) raised an interesting question: even if the number of prices is infinite uncountable, in the market economy individuals do not work on an infinite domain: they do not need to take into account all possible prices when they act; otherwise, they will not be able to solve the problem of economic calculation either. So, why Murphy insists that the central planning unit must take into account all possible prices, all possible goods and services, even if they were not invented yet?",1
51,16,"Murphy＊s possible answer could be that this requirement of taking into account all possible prices is not motivated only by the innovation problem per se. In a private property regime, that is in a market economy, the individuals express their preferences in relation with the properties they posses. The preferences of the individuals are expressed in the exchanges they make on the market. But they cannot make an infinite number of exchanges, because they posses only a definite amount of things that can be exchanged. From this perspective, the set of preferences of the individuals on the market is a finite set. In a society based on collective forms of property, the preferences of the individuals are not really limited. They may express how many preferences they want to, and central planning unit must take into account all these preferences, because, from the hypothesis, its role is to deduce the prices from the two kinds of data available: individual preferences and the total amount of resources. Therefore, if the planner or central planning unit is to mimic the market processes, it is bound to take into account all the preferences of individuals (which are virtually infinite). Thus, assuming the theory of subjective value, it follows that the resulting set of prices is also infinite. ",1
51,17,"There is one remaining problem: we did not give a straight answer to the first question. Is it really an infinite uncountable list of prices? We only stressed the fact that the potential set of individual preferences is infinite, because there is no limitation for individuals in simply uttering their preferences.",1
51,18,"Using Cantor＊s diagonal argument it is possible to demonstrate that the set of the prices which the planner must take into account is really uncountable, not only infinite. First, suppose that each good and its price are defined in equations using a set or a subset of preferences. Second, we already assumed that the set of all potential preferences of the individuals is an infinite set (p1,p2 ...pn). Given these two premises, it is possible to define a subset of preferences that differ from all other existing or future subsets of preferences (using the same method of changing on the diagonal each ※Yes§ to ※No§ and each ※No§ to ※Yes§). If somebody is trying to write down the new subset of preferences, on the diagonal will arise a new subset of preferences never listed before and so on. Thus, there is an one-to-one correspondence between the set of all possible preferences and the set of natural numbers but there is not an one-to-one correspondence between the set of all subsets of preferences and the set of natural numbers. Therefore, the number of subsets of preferences by which we assumed to define prices of the goods is an uncountable infinite set (Table III).",1
51,19,"Indeed, the consumer goods market alone cannot solve the general problem of the infinite uncountable set of preferences. Even if we admit that the set of consumer preferences is finite, the problem is not solved, because the set of managers and entrepreneurs＊ preferences is still an infinite uncountable set. On the market, managers and entrepreneurs often supply products that are not specifically requested by consumers. For example, when the Wachowski brothers wrote The Matrix, they were not responding to ※given§ consumer demand (Murphy, 2006). Entrepreneurs＊ investment preferences are limited on the market, because they can invest only the capital they posses. In a planned economy, a central planning unit still has the problem of defining the prices of intermediate goods, and it still must work taking into account an infinite uncountable set of prices for the intermediate goods.",1
51,20,"In the classical debate on economic calculation, Lange (1936, 1937) assumed that the planner must ultimately rely on the market prices for consumer goods. On this basis, he believed that it is possible for central planner to deduce the prices of intermediate goods. von Mises＊s response was that this fact will not solve the problem, because the planner will encounter the same problem at the level of intermediate goods. von Mises (1990) argued that the prices of intermediate goods are not established on the market using a technical method. The production factors are nor entirely specific, neither entirely non-specific. Technically, there are many possible ways to produce final goods using intermediate goods. Even if the prices of intermediate goods are partially relying on the preferences of individuals for final goods, they are ultimately established by entrepreneurs that bid for different amounts of intermediate goods. Market prices for intermediate goods help entrepreneurs to find the most profitable solution. Thus, the planner will encounter the same problem at the level of intermediate goods as encountered at the level of consumer goods.",1
51,21,"In this paper, we refined and reformulated Murphy＊s arguments, using Cantor＊s theorem from the set theories[6]. On this ground, we sustained the thesis that, in a planned economy, a computational model must take into account an uncountably infinite set of equations and prices. If this is correct, the real problem of the central planner would be the impossibility of setting up in the first place all the equations necessary in calculus, rather than the huge number of equations that must be computed. Given these premises of the problem, we sustain the thesis that computational models cannot mimic the market process.",1
51,22,"The conception regarding price formation is fundamental for economic calculation debate. Different theories of value lead to different theories of prices and for this reason the presuppositions regarding value are very important in economic calculation debate. Cottrell et al. raised their objection totally disregarding the real conception of Austrian School of Economics about value and price formation. On this basis, we rejected all important objections formulated by them in response to Murphy＊s (2006) theses.",1
52,1,"The 2008每2009 worldwide economic crisis serves as a backdrop to this study of the dynamics of citizens＊ economic expectations. Economic expectations are identified as crucial for a range of political attitudes. This study is the first to consider how information affects evaluations in times of a severe crisis, as prior research of information effects on economic evaluations took place in more stable economic times. It links citizens＊ news exposure and the content of economic news coverage with changes in prospective economic assessments. Drawing on a three-wave panel study and on a media content analysis between the panel waves, we thus provide a dynamic assessment of media influences on changes in economic evaluations. The results demonstrate that media exposure strongly affected expectations regarding the future development of the national economic situation, while being largely unrelated to personal economic expectations. We furthermore show that media dependency increases the magnitude of the media effect. We discuss the disconnect between personal and national economic evaluations with regard to mass-mediated economic information.",1
52,2,"Citizens＊ economic expectations are (partly) based on information about the economy (Kiewiet, 1983). There are (at least) three ways in which citizens＊ economic expectations may be affected 每 through personal experience, interpersonal communication and through the mass media (Mutz, 1992). In this article, we focus on the latter, information about the economy from the media. We assess to what degree media coverage of economic prospects has an impact on changing economic expectations in times of crisis. We furthermore address the question of which kinds of economic expectations are affected by the mass media. Does new information influence perceptions of one＊s own economic situation or only that of the entire country? (Mutz, 1992; see also, for example, Kinder and Sears (1981) for different outcomes of these types of economic assessments) As the media mostly cover the economic health of a nation or of sizable social groups within the nation, we follow prior studies by focussing on the influence of the media on assessments of the national economy (Mutz, 1992; Shah et al, 1999). We proceed by comparing this to media influence on assessments of personal economic expectations. We pose that evaluations of the national economy are largely influenced by mediated information. ",1
52,3,"The study explains changes in evaluations, thereby conservatively estimating the influence of information between two points in time. Finally, we take from literature in political communication that media effects are likely to differ in strength for different segments of the audience (see, McLeod et al, 2002). By closely linking indicators of media coverage to different types of economic assessments through an integration of media content and survey data, and by considering a potential moderation of media effects through news dependency, this study refines the understanding of the relationship between economic media coverage and citizens＊ evaluations.",1
52,4,"The literature on citizens＊ economic expectations in established democracies is mostly based on data collected at times when economic developments were relatively stable. Thus, this study is among the first to deal with economic perceptions at times when economic prospects rapidly and unequivocally deteriorated. Talk about the economic crisis is likely to make people uncertain about their economic prospects, and to alleviate this uncertainty they engage in information-seeking behaviour (Berger and Calabrese, 1975). This, in combination with heightened media attention for economically bad times (Fogarty, 2005), potentially renders mass-mediated economic information in times of crisis even more important.",1
52,5,"Rational choice theorists point out that it is not rational for citizens to be permanently fully informed about the state of the economy, just as they are ＆rationally ignorant＊ about current affairs in general (Downs, 1957). Yet, there is empirical evidence that many citizens have, in fact, quite some knowledge on economic matters such as their country＊s unemployment rate, in particular at election times (for example, Paldam and Nannestad, 2000). This is not to say that the perceptions or expectations that citizens have always accurately reflect the state of affairs. There are several reasons why citizens＊ perceptions would deviate from reality (for example, Hetherington, 1996). A first explanation holds that different citizens use different criteria in their evaluation of how well the economy is doing (Kinder et al, 1989). A second explanation is associated with partisanship (for example, Kramer, 1983), holding that citizens perceive economic conditions as more favourable if their preferred party is in power than if it is not (Wlezien et al, 1997; Van der Eijk et al, 2007). A third explanation 每 at the core of this study 每 is that citizens receive varying information from different sources about the state of the economy and form their evaluations accordingly. The role of the mass media as central information providers is discussed next.",1
52,6,"The subjective economy, that is, citizens＊ perceptions and evaluations of the economy, features prominently in studies on the political impact of the economy. Early interest in the mediating role of the mass media in the economic voting model (for an overview, see Key and Cummings, 1966; Lewis-Beck and Stegmaier, 2000) stems from the observation that subjective assessments of the economy rather than objective indicators were successful in explaining voting behaviour and/or election outcomes and that therefore there must be a distortion between the subjective and the real economy (for example, Sanders, 2000; Sanders et al, 2001). Hetherington (1996), for instance, showed the US economy to recover before the 1992 US Presidential elections, while mass-mediated information about the state of the economy was continuously negative. On the basis of this information, he argued that Clinton＊s victory in this election was more based on a perceived economic situation than on reality. Similar observations have been made regarding the 2001 UK General election (Sanders et al, 2001) and the 1998 German Bundestag election (Donsbach, 1999).",1
52,7,"Research about media influences on economic assessments is mostly based on macro-level analyses. In his time-series study, Mosley (1984) finds media estimates of the economic situation to be a far better predictor of economic assessments than official economic indicators. Relying on a similar design, Sanders et al (1993) and Goidel and Langley (1995) find the tone of economic news coverage to be affecting public assessments, in addition to the impact of real-world factors, in the United Kingdom and United States, respectively. The latter, however, show that only negative news coverage affects public evaluations, which is in line with Soroka＊s (2006) more recent analysis (see also Ju, 2008). Others come to different conclusions based on macro-level analyses, such as Haller and Norpoth (1997) who find little, or Wu et al (2000) who find no impact of economic news on assessments.",1
52,8,"We proceed to argue that these media effects are only likely to occur for assessments of the national economy (sociotropic evaluations), and not for assessments of the personal economic situation (egocentric evaluations). The economy is partly an obtrusive subject (Zucker, 1978) 每 a doorstep issue (Haller and Norpoth, 1997) 每 in that citizens may notice that others in the immediate surrounding lose their jobs, that the cost of living increases, that they themselves lose their job, or that shops in their neighbourhood go bankrupt. However, most developments of national economic scope are not all that easy to observe first-hand; here the economy is an unobtrusive issue. Apart from via the media or from talking to others, how should citizens learn about, for instance, changes in the GDP? Mutz (1992) considers how problem perceptions of unemployment are influenced by media coverage. Distinguishing different information sources and different types of problem assessments, she finds that personal experience with unemployment significantly contributed to perceptions of unemployment as a personal problem, whereas exposure to newspaper coverage about unemployment ＆uniquely identifies perceptions of unemployment as a social problem＊ (p. 496). ",1
52,9,"Finally, we focus on differences in the potential effects of positive versus negative economic news coverage. Psychological studies have repeatedly shown that people pay greater attention to negative information as compared to positive information (for example, Fiske, 1980; Pratto and John, 1991), which makes them more likely to draw on this information when forming an opinion. In fact, prior research in the field of political communication confirms that negative information (also in the form of threat or risk frames) tends to have stronger effects on public opinion dynamics compared to positive information (for example, Schuck and de Vreese, 2006; de Vreese et al, 2011). These observations square well with the prevalence of threats and negativity in classic persuasion studies (for example, Hovland et al, 1953). Accordingly, and paying tribute to recent studies in the field of media and the economy (for example, Soroka, 2006) that argue that people are more likely to pick up negative information about the economy, we expect the impact of negative economic news to weigh stronger than that of positive news.",1
52,10,"The assumption that mass media content affects all citizens equally is somewhat na? ? ve (for example, Delli Carpini, 2004) and political communication research pays increasing attention to the contingency of media effects (McLeod et al, 2002; Walgrave and Van Aelst, 2006). We pursue this approach in our study of media effects on economic assessments. The degree to which individuals rely on the media for understanding and interpreting their surroundings is a key component of understanding the media＊s impact on opinions and evaluations. Media system dependency theory (Loges and Ball-Rokeach, 1993), abbreviated as MD, argues that the degree to which people depend on the news for informational goals matters for whether news coverage affects their perceptions (Morton and Duck, 2001). MD theory thus takes its starting point in the observation that the impact of media messages on audiences is a function of how dependent audiences are on (mass) media: the higher the dependency, the larger the effects. Initial support for the theory (for example, Ball-Rokeach et al, 1984) has been corroborated by experimental research on health communication effects. Morton and Duck (2001) found that the impact of mass communication on both personal and impersonal perceptions was moderated by self-reported dependency on mass-mediated information.",1
52,11,"This study focuses on media influences on changes in citizens＊ economic assessments. We are in particular interested, following the existing literature (for example, Soroka, 2006), in the potential impact of the tone of reporting, in this case mass-mediated future economic expectations, on prospective, sociotropic economic assessments.",1
52,12,"We rely on three-wave panel survey data and a news content analysis between the panel waves to address the expectations formulated above. Respondents reported whether and to what degree they were exposed to outlets that were subject to the content analysis, and media content and survey data were integrated. Relying on such a design allows assessing what kind of economic information respondents were exposed to between different time points and how this information exposure affects changes in their economic outlook.",1
52,13,"Owing to practical constraints, we relied on a more limited selection of media outlets for the second period. However, descriptive results demonstrate considerable similarity across outlets for that period. For instance, two of the three initially most negative outlets remain most negative in the second period (Metro period 1: 2, NRC Handelsblad period 1: 1.78, Metro period 2: 2, NRC Handelsblad period 2: 1.69). Moreover, in the first period nine of the eleven outlets range between 1 and 2 in terms of national economic evaluations, and this goes for seven out of the eight outlets analysed in the second period. Furthermore, a replication of the analyses for the first period that incorporates only those outlets that were also available in the second period yields highly similar results. This makes us confident that our (still broad, but more confined) selection of outlets for the second period suffices.",1
52,14,"We test the hypotheses on the basis of data from a three-wave panel survey of Dutch citizens eligible to vote. From an online panel of 143 809 citizens, 2400 persons over 17 years old were randomly selected, and invited to fill out an online questionnaire. Of these persons, 1394 completed the questionnaire,7 which yields a response rate (RR1) of 58 per cent. When compared to the census data from the Dutch electorate, groups underrepresented in our sample are men (47.0 per cent versus 49.4 per cent), young citizens (30.8 per cent versus 34.2 per cent), and those who had intermediate vocational education (31.3 per cent versus 48.0 per cent).",1
52,15,"In order to assess the hypotheses, we perform multiple OLS regression analyses. We present four models for sociotropic and four models for egocentric expectations, regressing economic expectations at t2 (second wave) and t3 (third wave) on the variables introduced above, while controlling for economic expectations at t1 (first wave) or t2 (second wave), respectively. The use of a lagged variable puts a focus on change of the dependent variable between two panel waves (for example, Markus, 1979). Moreover, controlling for prior economic assessments decreases the likelihood of our models being underspecified, as predictors of static economic evaluations are taken account of by including the lagged term.",1
52,16,"Furthermore, and interestingly, our results show that whereas personal economic circumstances did not affect changes in sociotropic expectations, household income was to some degree related to changes in egocentric expectations. Household income can be considered a proxy measure for information about peoples＊ personal economic situation. The findings thus provide some suggestive evidence that citizens rely on different information sources (personal experience versus the mass media) when forming the different types of economic expectations.",1
52,17,"The egocentric expectations on the aggregate level did not significantly change during the time of our study. In the midst of the worst crisis in over half a century, people＊s outlook on their personal financial situations was, on average, unaffected. Most people still believed that their personal financial situation would not be endangered, even if they predicted that the national economy would go down the drain within the coming year. We do not only see such a pattern for the Dutch case, but also more generally. All over Europe it seems that assessments of personal and national economics have diverged (Eurobarometer 71). Perhaps, this is a result of a lack of experience with a severe economic crisis. Perhaps, this is a more general psychological phenomenon of people＊s disbelief that any major misfortune might happen to them. Perhaps, this is because the crisis takes time to eventually affect a mass of individuals. Especially the latter explanation might have extra mileage because economists agree that it takes time from national economic developments to translate into individual pocket book considerations. In any case, it seems that citizens generally do not link the abstract world of macroeconomic figures to their personal situation.",1
52,18,"Whereas prior studies established a negativity bias in media effects on economic perceptions (for example, Soroka, 2006; Ju, 2008), our data did not confirm such a bias (not supporting H2). This is likely due to the fact that news coverage was univocally negative in our research period, whereby a heavier weighting of negative news did not change much of the variance in the independent variable. We, however, also note that the negativity bias was so far only established in macro-level time-series studies, and not at the level of the individual. It might be that micro-level dynamics work differently than those at a macro-level, in particular in times of economic crisis when the news environment may be unusually negative. Furthermore, we cannot empirically assess how our findings compare to a situation in which the economy is flourishing and characterized by an overall positive economic news climate. Prior macro-level research suggests that news effects are stronger in times of economic crisis (Wu et al, 2000), but future studies on the individual level should address this potential difference in the strength of media effects on economic assessments.",1
52,19,"This study further adds to existing research by taking into account the conditionality of news effects. Our findings corroborate research showing that media dependency is an important moderator of media influences. We indeed find that the more people depend on the news, the stronger the impact of exposure to positive versus negative economic information in the news on economic expectations becomes (supporting H3).These outcomes square well with the research by Ball-Rokeach et al (1984), who found that the strongest effects of media on attitudes and behaviours were among those individuals whose dependencies were more intense. Future research should focus on factors exogenous to the current model, so as to better chart the antecedents of motivations and dependency on the media for information. The fact that the interaction term was only significant in the first period, and that in the second period media dependency had a direct effect on changing expectations suggests that outlet-specific exposure was less important for those who heavily depend on the media in the second period.",1
52,20,"Notwithstanding these shortcomings, we believe to have added to the understanding of the dynamics of economic evaluations, in part as a function of economic news coverage. Knowing that media coverage can drive changes in economic evaluations bears implications for politics. If a positive economic outlook results in a higher likelihood of voting for a government party (for example, Lewis-Beck and Paldam, 2000) and vice versa, then media-induced negativity in economic expectations can be risky for those in power. Moreover, one can envision a spiral effect on economic conditions, if people who are more negative about future economic developments are likely to consume less (for example, Van Raaij, 1989) and thereby affect economic conditions. Although this study was conducted in a unique economic context, the dynamics bear relevance beyond the economic crisis under investigation.",1

53,1,"A knowledge economy still produces goods and services, although by the important use of knowledge. Therefore, economic models are relevant to understanding how a knowledge economy should properly work, particularly the financial system in a knowledge economy. When finance fails, all knowledge stops. Cross-disciplinary approaches to societal models of a knowledge economy are necessary and useful, because societies are more complex than can be seen by any single social science discipline. This was dramatically demonstrated in the first decade of the twenty-first century by the major failure of mainstream economic theory, as a basis for financial regulation. The surprising thing was that the economic discipline as a whole did not take this empirical opportunity to rethink economic theory, to build together a new and valid theory. Instead, the schools of economics continued to argue with one another. We take this historical case of scholastic conflict to reexamine economic theory, but within a cross-disciplinary framework. We use the modeling that had been accomplished in the two conflicting economic schools〞exogenous and endogenous schools. Each modeled parts of an economic system, production subsystem (exogenous school) and financial subsystem (endogenous school). ",1
53,2,"Going back in time from 2012 to 2010 to 2009 (the recent years following the financial crisis of 2008), one can find the historical evidence of theory failure and also of a continuing failure of the discipline to agree upon how to construct valid theory. In science, of course, when theory fails to explain empirical reality, then theory is changed. But matters were not so straightforward in the recent history of the economics discipline. Instead of immediately rushing to change economic theory, there continued a contentious debate among economists. Was a market empirically perfect or only ideally perfect? Mainstream economic theory had constructed an economic model of supply每demand每price equilibrium, which was based upon the assumption of a perfect market. But fact was that the financial market had been far from perfect. For example in 2012, one economist, Howard Davies, then a professor at Sciences Po in Paris wrote: ※In an exasperated outburst, just before he left the presidency of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet complained that: ＆as a policymaker during the crisis. I found the available models of limited help; in fact, I would go further. In the face of the crisis, we felt abandoned by conventional tools.＊§ (Davies 2012).",1
53,3,"Previously Davies had been the Director of the London School of Economics and earlier was the Chairman of Britain＊s Financial Services Authority and even earlier the Deputy Director of the Bank of England. Professionally as an economist, Davies was both an economic academician and practiced as a banking authority. His view about the how contemporary economic theory had been useful to practice was negative: ※Our approach to regulation in the past was based on the assumption that financial markets could to a large extent be left to themselves, and that financial institution and their boards were best placed to control risk and defend their firms. These assumptions took a hard hit in the crisis, causing an abrupt shift to far more intrusive regulation. Finding a new and stable relationship between the financial authorities and private firms will depend crucially on a reworking of our intellectual models.§ (Davies 2012).",1
53,4,"Earlier in 2010, Chris Giles had reported: ※Many of the world＊s top academic economists agreed on Friday (April 9, 2010) that the financial and economic crisis had exposed fatal flaws in their subject and ideas were urgently needed to keep economics relevant. While this represented an unusual consensus, the eminent economic brains lived up to their stereotype by disagreeing on what policies, if any, should be adopted to prevent a repetition.... The participants were speaking at the inaugural conference of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, a think-tank sponsored by George Soros, the billionaire financier. They included five Nobel prize-winners (in economics). Held at King＊s College, Cambridge... the conference participants could neither agree on the cause of the crisis nor the necessary remedies. One disagreement hinged on whether asset price bubbles lay at the heart of the crisis. Those who thought so argued for tighter regulation... (Others, such as) Michael Goldberg, of the University of New Hampshire, said it was wrong to suggest the price swings were necessarily a bubble and that they were more likely to be fundamental to the beneficial forces of capitalism.§ (Giles 2010).",1
53,5,"Another economist, Charles J. Whalen, had written: ※The financial crisis that ran from late 2007 through early 2009 did more than traumatize the world economy; it drew widespread attention to some major shortcomings of conventional economics. Paul Krugman pointed out those weaknesses in a number of public lectures and in the pages of The New York Times, but he was not alone. Forced to confront the reality of the Great Recession, a number of prominent scholars and policymakers also joined the chorus.§ (Whalen 2012).",1
53,6,"Back in 2009, Paul Krugman (a Noble prize economist) analyzed his discipline: ※It＊s hard to believe now, but not long ago economists were congratulating themselves over the success of their field. Those successes〞or so they believed〞were both theoretical and practical, leading to a golden era for the profession. On the theoretical side, they thought that they had resolved their internal disputes.... And in the real world, economists believed they had things under control: the ＆central problem of depression-prevention has been solved＊, declared Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago in his 2003 presidential address to the American Economic Association. In 2004, Ben Bernanke, a former Princeton professor who is now the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, celebrated the Great Moderation in economic performance over the previous two decades, which he attributed in part to improved economic policy making. (But) last year (2008), everything came apart. ... Few economists saw our current crisis coming, but this predictive failure was the least of the field＊s problems. More important was the profession＊s blindness to the very possibility of catastrophic failures in a market economy. ... During the golden years, financial economists came to believe that markets were inherently stable〞indeed, that stocks and other assets were always priced just right. ",1
53,7,"Krugman wrote about this division among economists: ※Meanwhile, macroeconomists (remain) divided in their views. But the main division was between those who insisted that free-market economies never go astray and those who believed that economies may stray now and then (but that any major deviations from the path of prosperity could and would be corrected by the all-powerful Fed). Neither side was prepared to cope with an economy that went off the rails despite the Fed＊s best efforts. ... And in the wake of the crisis, the fault lines in the economics profession have yawned wider than ever.§ (Krugman 2009).",1
53,8,"Why did this fault line persist? Krugman explained this as due to ※aesthetics§: ※As I (Krugman) see it, the economics profession went astray because economists, as a group, mistook beauty, clad in impressive-looking mathematics, for truth. Until the (1930s) Great Depression, most economists clung to a vision of capitalism as a perfect or nearly perfect system. That vision wasn＊t sustainable in the face of mass unemployment. But as memories of the Depression faded, economists fell back in love with the old, idealized vision of an economy in which rational individuals interact in perfect markets; this time gussied up with fancy equations. ... Unfortunately, this romanticized and sanitized vision of the economy led most economists to ignore all the things that can go wrong. They turned a blind eye to the limitations of human rationality that often lead to bubbles and busts; to the problems of institutions that run amok; to the imperfections of markets〞especially financial markets〞that can cause the economy＊s operating system to undergo sudden, unpredictable crashes; and to the dangers created when regulators don＊t believe in regulation.§ (Krugman 2009).",1
53,9,"When the price of a commodity is charted as the quantity of the supply of the product (dotted line) then the price will decrease in an economy as the supply increases. Because of business competition, more goods flooding a market will force prices down. Also, if the demand for a product (solid line) increases, then the price will increase (as more consumers buy a limited amount of product). The optimal pricing of a product (commodity) in an economy will occur when supply equals demand. This is the equilibrium price, as supply and demand meet in quantity. If a market behaves like this, it is perfect. No control over pricing is necessary, as a supply每demand equilibrium in the market sets the optimal price.",1
53,10,"Neo-Keynesians argued that the Neo-Classical Synthesis School economists had too narrowly viewed an economy as only a production system. Ben Bernanke wrote: ※Economists have not always fully appreciated the importance of a healthy financial system for economic growth or the role of financial conditions in short-term economic dynamics. ... During the first few decades after World War II, economic theorists emphasized the development of general equilibrium models of the economy with complete markets; that is, in their analyses, economists generally abstracted from market ＆frictions＊ such as imperfect information or transaction costs. But without such frictions, financial markets have little reason to exist.§",1
53,11,"Minsky argued that a time dimension was important to a model of an economy. In 1936, John Marnard Keynes had introduced a time dimension in an economy〞in order to include ※finance§ as a part of the economic model. ※In the General Theory, Keynes sought to create a model of the economy in which money is never neutral (to pricing). He did this by creating a model... in which the price level of financial... assets is determined in (financial) markets where... the price of money... is an asset whose value is derived from its liquidity. For Keynes, each capital and financial asset yields an income stream, (which) has carrying costs and possessing some degree of liquidity... The price level of assets is determined by the relative value... (of) income... and liquidity...§ (Minsky 1993)",1
53,12,Time dependence in a Keynes model of a financial system lies in the concepts of: a ※present-income§ and a ※future liquidity§ of a ※capital asset.§ A capital asset is an investment which creates income and can later be sold. A capital asset produces an income stream (present-income) but also can be sold in the future (future liquidity) (Minsky 1975). The time dimension is from (T1) of a present-income to (T2) of future liquidity. This present-to-future (T1 to T2) temporal process occurs in a financial system as a transaction of ※credit-debt.§ Minsky wrote: ※Every capitalist economy is characterized by a system of borrowing and lending... The fundamental borrowing and lending act... is an exchange of ＆money-now＊ for ＆money-in-the-future＊. This exchange takes place... in a negotiation in which the borrower demonstrates to the satisfaction of the lender〞that the money of the future part of the contract will be forthcoming.... The money in the future is to cover both the interest and the repayment of the principle of the contract.§ (Minsky 1993).,1
53,13,"This is the time dimension of any financial system〞the yesterday of credit, the today of interest payment, and the tomorrow of paying off the debt. Credit and debt as a financial process is essentially temporal; and this is why models of economic systems must have a time dimension for Keynesians.And a financial market provides liquidity through valuing capital assets: ※In the General Theory, Keynes... created a model... in which the price level of financial... assets is determined in (financial) markets... where ... the price of money... is an asset whose value is derived from its liquidity... For Keynes, each capital and financial asset yields an income stream, (which) has carrying costs and possessing some degree of liquidity... The price level of assets is determined by the relative value... (of) income in the future and liquidity now.§ (Minsky 1993). A financial market makes the credit-debt contracts sellable in the future, as future liquidity. A capital asset must have two temporal features of a current-income and a future liquidity. A financial market provides the capability of future liquidity for a capital asset.",1
53,14,"The Neo-Classical Synthesis School focused upon the production subsystem; in which the present price of a commodity is the key factor of control in a production subsystem. The Neo-Keynesian School focused upon a financial subsystem, in which future price of a capital asset is the key factor of control in a financial subsystem. The modeling challenge is to use both these economic models (theories) in a complementary framework. For this, one can methodologically use a ※meta-framework,§ such as in societal dynamics theory. In the meta-framework for economic system modeling, we use a topological systems model of a society, in which an economy is an economic subsystem; and in the economic subsystem are production and financial sub-subsystems. The development of this societal systems model can be found in (Betz 2011).",1
53,15,"In a societal dynamics topological model of the stasis of a society, the major systems in an industrialized society can be classified into four kinds of subsystems (economic, cultural, political, and technological; and these can be topologically presented as stacked planes, as in Fig. 4). Also traditionally in economics, an economy is composed of production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The production subsystem produces the goods and services from material/energy resources and financed by a financial system. These goods/services are consumed within a market. Thus any economic system can be partitioned into four subsystems of production, market, finance, and resources. Therein, we can now place the exogenous school＊s model of an economy (as a production system) within this larger societal context〞as the production subsystem of the economic system. Also, one can place the endogenous school＊s model of an economy (as a financial system) within this larger societal context〞as the financial subsystem of the economic plane.",1
53,16,"To understand how to connect the partial economic models from the endogenous and exogenous schools, we will next draw upon other models from other social science disciplines, aiming toward a connectable model of a societal economic subsystem〞a cross-disciplinary economic system.",1
53,17,"Because the economics discipline distinguishes micro for macroeconomics, we first add cross-disciplinary partial models for microeconomics. For this we turn to management science for a model of a productive economic agent, which is to say, a business that produces goods or services. This is a standard model in management science, called an ※enterprise model,§ and first popularized by Michael Porter (Porter 1985; Fig. 6). A productive organization can be depicted as adding value to resources and labor obtained from its environment by transforming these into products sold back to the environment as customers. This is an open system model of a firm, receiving inputs of resources and labor from its environment and transforming this into value-added products sold back into the organization＊s environment.",1
53,18,Thus the equilibrium pricing model of supply每demand is applicable only to a specific set of productions (commodity) within a specific sector of an industrial value chain. The first arrow indicates that a firm model belongs functionally to a specific industrial sector; and the second arrow indicates that the commodity supply每demand curve is functionally specific to an industrial sector.,1
53,19,This placement of the exogenous school＊s supply每demand model upon a societalmodel topological plane shows that data must be specific to an industrial chain for the supply每demand model to be empirically real (real supply每demand data in and valid price information out).,1
53,20,"The data for such an aggregate account comes from revenue data reported each firm and grouped by commodities produced. Again, we note that in each partial model, data does not flow necessarily from one model to another but must be gathered independently.",1
54,1,"This paper examines the relative impact of economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights on growth. A system of three simultaneous equations is used to unearth the channels through which these institutional dimensions affect economic growth. These include greater efficiency and enlarged investment in physical and human capital. The sample contains 79 countries and six periods covering the years from 1976 to 2005. The results show that the three dimensions of institutional quality are important for economic growth either through a better allocation of resources or, indirectly, through the stimulation of investment in physical and human capital.",1
54,2,"The factors that determine the economic growth of nations and account for crossnational differences in per-capita real incomes are a main concern of economists. The literature on this matter is abundant, but the empirical research has only been moderately successful at showing what is behind the growth processes and the observed inequalities. For this reason, evermore explanatory variables have been incorporated into growth models until, at the end of the twentieth century, institutional factors were included, complementing the more traditional variables such as labor, physical and human capital, and technology used in neoclassical and endogenous growth models (Olson 1982, 1996).",1
54,3,"In recent years, the incorporation of institutions into growth models has become a habitual practice among researchers (Ak?omak and Weel 2009; Barro 1996; Easterly and Levine 2003; Hall and Jones 1999; Mauro 1995; Rigobon and Rodrik 2005; Stroup 2007; Yang 2008). Most of them have found a positive and significant effect of institutional quality on economic growth, even though the results cannot be considered conclusive. With respect to the different dimensions encompassed by the concept of institutional quality, economic freedom, followed by political freedom, have generated the most interest in the empirical literature (Aixal芍 and Fabro 2009). For this reason, we select these two aspects with the view to analyze their respective impacts on growth.",1
54,4,"Civil liberties and political rights have frequently been conflated under the heading of political freedom, notwithstanding the fact that they are different concepts and, thus, have different implications for economic growth. Civil liberties allow for the freedom of expression and belief, freedom of the press, associational and organizational rights, as well as for the rule of law and personal autonomy. Political rights enable people to participate freely in the political process, including through the rights to vote freely, to compete for public office, to join political parties and organizations, and to elect representatives who have a decisive impact on public policies and are accountable to the electorate.",1
54,5,"In regard to the different concepts of freedom, Milton Friedman (2002) points out the necessity of using three classifications, instead of two, such as economic, civil, and political freedom. Political freedom must be understood as the way the political structure is configured, the right to vote, and the definition of democracy as a society where civil servants are elected through citizens＊ votes. By civil freedom he means freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of expression; in short, what is termed human rights. Hong Kong constitutes an example of such a distinction. Under British rule, while citizens lacked political freedom, as Freedom House would understand it, they did enjoy a high level of civil freedom (i.e., freedom of speech and assembly). Therefore, a country can have a high level of civil and economic liberties without having political freedom. However, it seems difficult to have political freedom without economic freedom. For example, in China the spread of economic freedom should bring about more political freedom.",1
54,6,"Ariel Benyishay and Roger Betancourt (2010) argue that the protection of human rights through the provision of civil liberties is one of the most fundamental indicators of the prevalence of the rule of law in a society. Violation of human rights (through loss of life, imprisonment, or other less dramatic restrictions of capabilities to make choices and enjoy one＊s liberties) deprives individuals of property rights. They believe that civil liberties are important for markets to function at a high level due to their socially contrived nature, suggesting a causal mechanism between civil liberties and long- term economic development.",1
54,7,"With the aim of clarifying the channels through which institutional quality affects economic growth, a second contribution of this paper is the use of a system of three simultaneous equations. In order to analyze both the direct (greater efficiency) and indirect (greater investment) impact on growth, we added one equation of investment in physical capital and another of investment in human capital to the growth equation. We assessed the system using panel data techniques and weighted two-stage least squares. This technique overcomes the problems of heteroskedasticity and endogeneity typically found in studies of institutional quality and economic growth. Research in this line has generally not accounted for possible time that elapses between institutional changes and their impact on growth. With the object of capturing this effect, the third contribution of this paper is to use lags of the institutional variables.",1
54,8,"Growth theoreticians who share ideas of the property rights school as well as some of North＊s contributions point out that economic freedom increases productivity by reducing transaction costs, thereby encouraging accumulation of human and physical capital stocks, strengthening specialization and economies of scale, promoting more efficient organizations, and fomenting business innovation (Kirzner 1973, 1997; Schumpeter 1912). In order for the market to work efficiently, precise and well-defined property rights are necessary since, without them, the costs of negotiation involved in the allocation and distribution of resources would be prohibitive (Tornell 1997). Moreover, the lack of transparent information and the entry barriers for new competitors, as well as for international competition, impose transaction costs on the economy that limit market opportunities. In fact, economic freedom is the institutional characteristic for which the highest consensus has been achieved with respect to its positive and significant impact on growth (Azman-Saini, Baharumshah and Law 2010; Carlsson and Lunsdtr?m 2002; Dawson 2003; De Vanssay and Spindler 1994; Easton and Walker 1997; International Monetary Fund 2003; Justesen 2008; Stroup 2007).",1
54,9,"One of the aspects of economic freedom that has gained special attention in recent years is regulation. Several empirical studies analyze the impact of regulation on growth and conclude that it is negative. In particular, Harold Cole et al. (2005) argue that international and domestic competition barriers are the key to understanding Latin America＊s low total factor productivity (TFP). Stagnant relative TFP is the main determinant of Latin America＊s relative income and labor productivity stagnation. John W. Dawson (2006) argues that reducing regulation has a positive impact on growth through both the investment channel (the indirect effect) and the total factor productivity channel (the direct effect). Enedina Licerio, Thomas Fullerton, and Don Clark (2010) quantify the potential income gains associated with deregulation and conclude that reducing regulatory burdens leads to increases in per capita incomes.",1
54,10,"Robert Barro (1996) promotes the existence of a non-linear relationship between democracy and growth, so that higher levels of democracy encourage growth in countries with lower levels of political freedom mainly because government abuse is limited. At the same time, these high levels of democracy hinder growth when a moderate level of political freedom exists. According to Barro, widening political freedom could slow down growth when a certain threshold is reached. This is partly due to the appearance of redistributive pressures.",1
54,11,"Because of the interconnectedness of all these freedoms, as well as their role as ※instrumental freedoms,§ Amartya Sen (1999) proposes that a satisfactory conception of freedom must be fairly broad, and that its virtues are both intrinsic and instrumental. In general, he argues that political and social freedoms are inherently desirable and conducive to economic growth. Sen further stresses the importance of focusing on economic development as an integrated process of expanding substantive freedoms that encompass economic, social, and political considerations. This broad approach allows the simultaneous appreciation for the vital roles in the development process of many different institutions, including markets and market-related organizations, governments and local authorities, political parties and civic institutions, education programs and forums, and many others.",1
54,12,"The fact that economic freedom fosters growth has been widely acknowledged. Nevertheless, importance must not only be attributed to markets, but also to the role that economic, social, and political freedoms play in improving and enriching people＊s general capacities. Sen identifies five types of freedom, as viewed from an instrumental perspective: political freedom, economic freedom, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and security networks. The promotion of such diverse but interrelated instrumental freedoms can contribute to the success of public policy intended to foster human capacities and substantive freedoms. While development analysis, on the one hand, pursues objectives that would consequently enhance these instrumental freedoms, it must also take into account the empirical connections existing between the various freedoms in order to reinforce their joint importance. In fact, these connections are of vital importance to a wider understanding of the instrumental role of freedom.",1
54,13,"Some empirical papers (Giavazzi and Tabellini 2005; Persson and Tabellini 2006) maintain that liberalizing the economy is an essential first step before the extension of political rights can generate growth. Inchoate democracies operating in closed economies face conflicts of redistribution, while established democracies in open economies are forced to pay more attention to economic efficiency. Furthermore, economic liberalization stimulates the rule of law and better protection of property rights, two prerequisites for democracy to generate growth (Giavazzi and Tabellini 2005).",1
54,14,"Empirical research, as stated earlier, frequently takes civil liberties and political rights globally as indicators of political freedom (Farr, Lord and Wolfenbarger 1998; Helliwell 1994; Wu and Davis 1999). This empirical research also provides results that are diverse and less robust than those obtained in the case of economic freedom, showing the conflict between costs and benefits pointed out by the theory. Some find an overall beneficial effect of democracy on economic growth (Gwartney, Lawson and Block 1996; Hanke and Walters 1997; Rigobon and Rodrik 2005; Rodrik 1999a; Scully 1988; Varsakelis 2006). Others, however, find that this relationship is neither significant nor robust (Alesina et al. 1996; Ali and Crain 2002; Barro and Sala-iMartin 1995; De Haan and Siermann 1995, 1996; Mulligan, Gil and Sala-i-Martin 2004), and even, in some cases, slightly negative (Helliwell 1994; Tavares and Wacziarg 2001).",1
54,15,"An often ignored question in empirical research is the timing of complex causal relations between institutional factors and economic results. Although some of the generated effects may be contemporaneous, others present a lagged structure. For example, economic freedom frequently requires a certain lapse of time before it produces a tangible effect. Credibility then becomes a vitally important factor in growth processes. This is especially true in countries that have historically suffered from unstable and changing policies, and where there is a strong opposition to liberalization policies.",1
54,16,"Further, this paper stresses the necessity to consider the difference between the direct and indirect effects of institutional quality on growth. This difference has often been ignored and, when taken into account, has led to a remarkable lack of consensus. In the case of economic freedom, for some authors (Hall and Jones 1999), the effect is greater on productivity than on the accumulation of productive factors. For others (Ayal and Karras 1998), economic freedom promotes growth by improving both the total factor productivity and the accumulation of human and physical capital. Some believe that growth is encouraged only through greater efficiency in the allocation of resources (Ali and Crain 2002; De Haan and Siermann 1998; De Haan and Sturm 2000), while others emphasize the role of investment (Dawson 2003; Eicher, Garc赤a-Pe?alosa and Teksoz 2006; P??kk?nen 2010).",1
54,17,"In the case of political freedom, some authors claim that democracy could promote growth while fostering human capital accumulation (Mariscal and Sokoloff 2000). For physical capital, the evidence is less conclusive. Authors like Jos谷 Tavares and Romain Wacziarg (2001), Philipp Harms and Heinrich Ursprung (2002), and Matthias Busse (2004) find that democratic countries attract direct foreign investment, while Adam and Filippaios (2007) argue that democracy may reduce private investment. Jos谷 Aixal芍 and Gema Fabro (2009), for their part, point out that while in the case of physical capital investment only economic freedom matters, for human capital investment economic and political freedoms are relevant.",1
54,18,"It is desirable to clarify these channels in order to have a better knowledge of the processes of economic growth. Furthermore, if these indirect channels (accumulation of human and physical capital) are included as explanatory variables in the regressions, it has to be born in mind that the coefficient of the institutional variable does not reflect the total effect on economic growth, and could lead to erroneous conclusions. For this reason, the estimation of models of simultaneous equations is a good option, although it has been rarely used (Alesina et al. 1996; Faruk, Kamel and V谷ganzon豕s-Varoudakis 2006; Leite and Weidman 2002; Rigobon and Rodrik 2005; are some exceptions).",1
54,19,"Institutional change is often a difficult and slow process, because the institutions of a country may be deeply rooted in its history and culture. In addition, it is very likely that those who wish to maintain the status quo will be against comprehensive reforms. Nevertheless, it is sometimes important to incorporate the temporal dimension because the institutional changes occur with remarkable speed, especially in developing countries. For example, the IMF (2003) demonstrated that important rule-of-law progress has occurred worldwide since the mid-1980s, and especially during the early 1990s. Similarly, it pointed to the political and economic reforms in the formerly centrally planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe, where they have caused a generalized institutional strengthening. The IMF also noted the radical changes that have occurred in such ※post-conflict§ states as Kosovo and Afghanistan.",1
54,20,"In this paper we use as institutional data the indices of civil liberties and political rights published annually by Freedom House since the early 1970s. These indices are based on the strict evaluations of regional experts, human rights specialists, academics, journalists, and even political figures. Additionally, we refer to the index of world economic freedom published by the Fraser Institute since the 1970s. This index mainly incorporates quantifiable, objective data, although some of its components are subjectively evaluated by various researchers and experts (see Appendix 1, p. 1077).",1
54,21,"The main reason we chose these indices for economic freedom, civil liberties and political rights, instead of others, is the prestige of the organizations that publish them. In addition, they are good proxies for the concepts they are intended to measure. Moreover, their broad coverage in terms of time and countries is especially appropriate both for the use of panel data techniques and for the introduction of lags in the variable to examine the delay with which these freedoms sometimes affect growth. For the other variables 〞 growth of per capita GDP (PPP), investment in physical capital, rates of enrolment in primary and secondary education (as investment in human capital), trade and initial income 〞 we refer to the World Development Indicators database of the World Bank.",1
54,22,"When institutional dimensions are considered individually, all the traditional variables exhibit the expected signs and are generally significant. In the growth equation, as predicted by neoclassical theory, the initial income shows a negative sign that is significant in eight of the nine estimations carried out, thereby confirming the hypothesis of convergence. The investment in physical and human capital variables have positive and statistically significant coefficients, except for human capital which, in spite of presenting the expected sign in all cases, is not significant in three of the nine equations. For the investment in physical and human capital equations, all the explanatory variables (rate of enrollment in primary education and openness in the first equation, and the lagged rate of enrollment in primary education and initial income in the second) have the expected positive sign and a high level of significance in all the estimations.",1
54,23,"With respect to the institutional variables under study, the most outstanding results give rise to the following considerations: Economic freedom (Table 1) has a significant impact on growth not only by improving the allocation of resources, but also by encouraging investment in physical and human capital, given that in the three equations of the system it has a high level of significance (systems 1 and 2). When two lags are introduced in the analysis (system 3), economic freedom retains its significance in the equation of physical capital investment and the explanatory power of the model improves.",1
54,24,"These empirical results support the ideas of the property rights school as well as some contributions by North (1990) and Olson (1982), which would later be incorporated by growth theory, about the role of economic freedom in promoting the accumulation of physical and human capital and in increasing productivity by reducing transaction costs. Civil liberties (Table 2) and political rights (Table 3) are important for growth because they improve the allocation of resources and investment in physical and human capital (systems 1, 2, and 3). When two lags of the variables are included, civil liberties and political rights retain their significance in the three equations and the explanatory power of the models improves.",1
54,25,"Other research (Gwartney, Lawson and Holcombe 1999; Hanke and Walters 1997; Stroup 2007) supports the view that economic freedom has greater impact on growth than civil liberties and political rights. As seen in Table 4, when current values are used, the results show superior coefficients for this institutional dimension. It is true, however, that in the case of human capital the coefficient for civil liberties is almost as large and when lags are included in the variables economic freedom loses its supremacy.",1
54,26,"This paper endeavored to uncover the relative importance of institutional dimensions like economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights for economic growth. Furthermore, its objective was to differentiate between the direct and indirect effects of these dimensions. First, the results showed that the three dimensions of institutional quality are important for the economic growth of countries either through stimulating a better allocation of resources or, indirectly, by encouraging investment in physical and human capital. Second, with respect to the relative importance of the three dimensions of institutional quality, the results suggest a greater impact of the contemporaneous values of economic freedom although, in the case of investment in human capital, it is closely followed by civil liberties. When lags are introduced, civil liberties and political rights retain their high level of significance, but economic freedom is no longer the most relevant dimension.",1

Economic liberalization consists of reforms in both trade liberalization and financial liberalization. This study contributes to the existing literature by constructing an economic liberalization index using principal component analysis. Our results show, firstly, that economic liberalization reforms have a positive impact on economic growth in the short run. However, trade liberalization is negatively associated with economic growth in the long-run. Secondly, the estimated coefficients through rolling window show that impact of economic liberalization on real GDP is unstable during the selected period of sample.

In addition, financial reforms by way of a sectoral credit allocation should be introduced to further promote the economic growth.",1
55,2,"The link between economic liberalization (EL) and economic growth (EG) has drawn significant attention from researchers after the emergence of new growth theories. In 1980s, many developing countries have put into practice the endogenous growth theory model and started the process of liberalization in order to achieve EG.

However, empirical evidence on the results of financial and trade liberalization are inconclusive.",1
55,3,"Pakistan started the process of financial sector liberalization in late 1980s.

56,1,"The relationship between stock market and economic growth is tested for Portugal (1993每2011), which is a small open economy dependent on bank financing. The relationship between economic growth and bank financing is also appraised. Using Vector Autoregressive (VAR) modeling, Granger causality, variance decomposition and impulse response function are discussed. The physical replacement of the currency, as a consequence of the integration in the European Monetary Union, proves to be an economic regime change. The effect of the subprime crisis was also proved. There is evidence of Granger bidirectional causality between the stock market and economic growth. Meanwhile, there was no evidence of causality running from bank financing to economic growth.",1
56,2,"The relationship between economic growth and the financial system, whose components are stock markets and the banking system, has received considerable attention for decades (e.g. Beck and Levine, 2004; Capasso, 2008; Goldsmith, 1969; Keynes, 1973; Levine, 1991; Schumpeter, 1982). Traditionally, Anglo-Saxon countries use mainly the capital market for corporate financing, while in non-Anglo-Saxon countries the banking system predominates (e.g. Marini, 2005; Lee, 2012).",1
56,3,"The use of long series as well as the control of structural changes might be important in determining the relationship between the financial system and growth. Given that structural changes may have the strongest impacts on a small economy, we will focus on Portugal. This exercise will allow us to verify the interaction of variables during the 1990s and 2000s, a period full of both economic and political change. Considering that Portugal is a non-Anglo-Saxon country, the banking system is expected to play a more significant role in the economy than the stock market.",1

As a result, four indicators can be used to study stock market development (e.g. Demirgu?-Kunt and Levine, 1996): (i) market capitalization; (ii) volatility measured by standard deviation of stock market; (iii) indicators of institutional development; and (iv) regulation indicators. Since the banking system must be included, it can be measured by the ratio of domestic credit to GDP or the ratio of nominal money supply (monetary aggregate M2) to nominal GDP. Other variables are often used for robustness of the model. The most common is inflation (e.g. Bassanini et al., 2001).",1
56,6,"Studies dealing with the financial system and economic growth have been discussed mostly in quantitative terms, through crosscountry (e.g. King and Levine, 1993; Levine and Zervos, 1998)panel data (e.g. Luintel and Khan, 1999; Zang and Kim, 2007)andtimeseries (e.g. Gries et al., 2009; Masih et al., 2009; Wolde-Rufael, 2009). Causal relationships between stock markets and economic growth have been shown (e.g. Adamopoulos, 2010; Nieuwerburgh et al., 2006). Causality could be from stock market to economic growth, from economic growth to stock market (e.g. Shahbaz et al., 2008)orbidirectional(e.gCapasso, 2008; Hondroyiannis et al., 2005; Ndako, 2010; Tsouma, 2009). On the other hand, causality may not be present. The analysis of causality was extended to combine the short and long run, as well as strong causality (Bangake and Eggoh, 2011). The direction of causality could be central for economic policy decision making.",1
56,7,"Financial development, as a result of endogenous growth process, is far from new in the literature (e.g. Bose and Cothren, 1997; Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1990). Indeed, it is expected that all variables will interact with each other causing an effect of an endogenous adjustment, and therefore the use of VAR technique is required. This technique treats the variables as potentially endogenous, evaluating the relationships without the prior need to distinguish endogenous from exogenous variables, as required by the simultaneous equations model. In the analysis of the relationship between developed stock markets and economic growth, this technique was used, for example by Caporale et al. (2004), and Tsouma (2009).",1
56,8,"The results show that, for the analysis of the contribution of stock market on economic growth, the appropriate VAR specification requires considering as exogenous the variables: constant, seasonal dummies, one impulse dummy at second quarter of 2000, and two shift dummies. On the one hand, it is necessary to control for the physical introduction of euro notes and coins/integration in Euronext and, on the other hand, to control for the evidence of the subprime crisis in Portugal (since the last quarter of 2008). Moreover, the results of VAR also indicate the prevalence of the physical introduction of the euro over the integration in Euronext. Indeed, the shift dummy is highly statistically significant in the GDP equation, with a negative signal, and it is equally negative and statistically significant in the stock market equation.",1
56,9,"To carry out the VAR estimation, we proceed by testing the optimal lag structure through the sequential modified LR test, the final prediction error, and the Akaike information criterion. All tests indicate three lags. This short optimal number of lags reveals a parsimonious model, and could be a sign of absence of the omission variable bias. The validity of the estimated VAR model was evaluated through diagnostic tests (see Table 3), namely: normality, by using the Jarque Bera test, autocorrelation through the LM test, and heteroskedasticity by performing the White test (without cross terms).",1
56,10,"This paper focuses on the contribution of two competing systems of financing the economy, stock markets and bank financing, towards economic growth. In designing economic policy for growth, it is crucial to understand this fully. In fact, if economic growth responds differently in face of an innovation in the two systems, then policy makers should focus their action preferentially on the most responsive one.",1
56,11,"The competing systems are proved different in terms of Granger causality, variance decomposition and impulse response function. Actually, an innovation in one brings, as expected, a decrease in the relative weight of the other in the system, as can be seen in Fig. 3. The response of bank financing to an innovation in the stock market is more pronounced and faster than the reverse. In general, bank financing is closed in on itself more than the stock market is. This result is largely unexpected. Indeed, as a non-Anglo-Saxon country, in Portugal the use of bank financing by corporations should be widespread. Accordingly, bank lending ought to play a major role in Portuguese economic growth.",1
56,12,"The results from Table 5 are in line with those obtained from the exogeneity tests. Indeed, all variables reveal dynamic behavior which is a requirement of endogeneity (see Table 5 and Fig. 3). With regard to DLY, after a two-quarter lag, shocks to DLY explain around 85% of the forecast error variance. This impact is reduced to around 59% at the end of the ten-quarter. When comparing the shocks to DLS and shocks to DLB, the shocks to DLS explain a substantially larger percentage of the forecast error variance than the shocks to DLB, i.e., about 15.5% and 3%, respectively at the end of ten-quarter. Shocks to DLI gain strength consistently, and jump from about 2.5% to 5.8% in the explanation of the forecast error variance. As expected, when the focus is on models incorporating financial variables, then the control for nominal effects reveals to be necessary. Indeed, at the end of ten-quarters, shocks to DLP explain around 16.6% of the forecast error variance.",1
56,13,"The effect of the stock market development on economic growth in Portugal (1993每2011), which is a small economy subject to strong impacts caused by structural changes, is analyzed. A comparison of the effects of the two competing systems of financing the economy 每 stock market and bank financing 每 on economic growth is also provided. No cointegration relationship was detected. A VAR model, with exogenous both impulse and shift dummies, was estimated. The VAR model proved to be suitable for handling the analysis of the relative contributions of the stock market and bank financing on economic growth. However, this analysis requires the inspection and posterior inclusion of the Portuguese idiosyncrasies. The absence of these controls could mask relevant causal relationships among variables, leading to erroneous conclusions.",1
56,14,"Regarding the two components of the financial system, two behaviors are observed. On the one hand, a positive causal relationship between stock market development and economic growth was detected, and it is, in fact, bidirectional. On the other hand, it appears that the banking system is not driving economic growth, but is a net beneficiary of that growth. In view of this, economic policies ought to be aware that it is stock market development, and not bank financing, that promotes economic growth. The different nature of these two components of the financial system deserves to be the object of further research, including understanding the transmission channels through which financial markets and their segments interact with economic growth.",1
56,15,"The control variables enabled facts often associated with the Portuguese reality to be proved. On the one hand, investment did not produce significant multiplier effects. On the other hand, the loss of economic price competitiveness is notorious. Also considered were the Portuguese idiosyncrasies, namely: (i) the break in the GDP series in the third quarter of 2000; (ii) the physical change in currency, from the escudo to the euro, which constitutes an economic regime change; and (iii) the subprime crisis. These facts prove to be mandatory for a full understanding of the transmission channels from finance to the economy.",1
57,1,"We look at economic voting during times of financial crisis using individual-level survey data from the 2008 and 2011 Canadian Election Studies. We posit that in times of crisis, the economy＊s impact on incumbent voting can be twofold. There is first an impact that is more traditional in nature and based on retrospective assessments of national economic conditions (which are necessarily bad given the crisis context). There is also an impact that is based on perceptions of the parties＊ competence at managing the economy. Depending on these perceptions, the competence effect can compensate for incumbent vote losses that might be incurred from bad economic times (traditional effect). In more general terms, looking at competence-based issue ownership allows us to add a neglected valence component to the economic voting model.",1
57,2,"From the viewpoint of voting behavior theory, the economy is a classic valence issue (Stokes, 1963). In democratic societies, basically all parties and voters agree that economic growth is a desirable goal. Put differently, neither parties nor voters really differ in their position on this issue since there is a virtual consensus about what should be achieved economically for the society as a whole. What really matters for voters, then, is whether the government actually delivers on that goal. If it does, it stands a greater chance of being reelected at election time. If it does not, then it seriously runs the risk of being voted out of office.",1
57,3,"The latter phenomenon has come to be known as the ＆traditional economic voting＊ expectation (Lewis-Beck, 1988). It forms the core of what can be called a valence model of economic voting (Lewis-Beck and Nadeau, 2011). Voters form a judgment on the government＊s past economic performance and cast their ballot based on that judgment. In other words, they hold the government accountable for the recent evolution of their country＊s economic situation.",1
57,4,"The valence model of economic voting, in its current formulation, is thus mostly concerned with voters＊ retrospective evaluations of economic conditions. While it makes sense to expect voters to react to recent changes in economic circumstances, it seems reasonable as well to assume that voters also take into account the issuehandling capabilities of the different political parties that are competing for their votes. The parties＊ reputation as competent political actors is an important component of the valence model of political choice (for example, Trilling, 1976; Petrocik, 1996; Clarke et al, 2004; B谷langer and Meguid, 2008; Pope and Woon, 2009; Green and Jennings, 2012; Egan, 2013). Following these insights, a growing body of work has started to examine the impact on vote choice of perceptions of party competence at managing the economy (for example, Sanders, 1999; Bellucci, 2006; Butt, 2006; Smith, 2007; B谷langer and G谷lineau, 2010).",1
57,5,"In this article, we wish to integrate these two valence dimensions of economic voting into a single incumbent vote model. So far, the valence model of economic voting has focused almost exclusively on the impact of retrospective economic evaluations, mostly ignoring the second dimension highlighted above, which involves issue ownership (the only exceptions in this regard are: Martinsson, 2009; B谷langer and G谷lineau, 2011). Taking both of these components of economic voting into account seems particularly relevant in the context of an economic crisis. In times of crisis, the economy＊s impact on incumbent voting can be expected to be twofold. There is first an impact that is more traditional in nature and based on retrospective assessments of national economic conditions (which are necessarily bad given the crisis context). There is also an impact that is based on perceptions of the parties＊ competence at managing the economy. Depending on the state of these perceptions, the competence effect can compensate for incumbent vote losses that might be incurred from bad economic times (traditional effect).",1
57,6,"We empirically demonstrate these dual effects with survey-based analyses of the vote for/against the incumbent Conservative Party of Canada in the 2008 and 2011 federal elections. In both of these elections, the Conservatives were reelected despite the economic crisis context, which suggests that the traditional economic voting hypothesis may not be sufficient for explaining the role of the economy as a valence issue in these election outcomes.",1
57,7,"For example, five federal elections have been held in Canada at times when the country was going through, or was still recovering from, a serious economic crisis. In three of these elections (1974, 2008, 2011) the incumbent party managed to get reelected. In the other two elections (1984, 1993) the incumbents experienced crushing defeats. How can we reconcile these different outcomes with the classic economic voting theory that would predict the incumbent＊s defeat in all of these five elections? In this article we offer an explanation that rests on the distinction between two valence dimensions of economic voting, the classic dimension and the issue ownership dimension, and we test it by examining two of these five Canadian elections more in depth. The next two sections present a more elaborate discussion of our theoretical considerations and expectations.",1
57,8,"The hypothesis of a link between the economy and incumbent voting rests on the principle of government accountability: governments are held responsible, at least in part, for the evolution of economic conditions and citizens reward (punish) the governing party if this evolution is positive (negative). The impact of economic conditions on support for incumbent governments has mainly been studied in the United States (Key, 1966; Kramer, 1971; Fiorina, 1981; Kiewiet, 1983; Lewis-Beck, 1988) but a similar relationship has been uncovered in most other Western democracies (for recent comparative studies, see Duch and Stevenson, 2008; Nadeau et al, 2013) with some of this literature having emphasized the conditionality of the relationship between the economy and the vote by taking into account either the role of institutional arrangements or voters＊ level of sophistication (see, in particular, Powell and Whitten, 1993; Anderson, 2007).",1
57,9,"This basic expectation forms the core of what Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011) refer to as the ＆valence＊ model of economic voting. They distinguish this type of economic voting from two other models: policy-oriented economic voting (Kiewiet, 1983; Lewis-Beck et al, 2013) where the economy acts as a positional issue (that is, voters have diverging views about economic policy outcomes and parties are associated with specific economic policies); and patrimonial economic voting (Nadeau et al, 2010; Lewis-Beck et al, 2013) where a person＊s patrimony (in terms of financial assets) influences his/her vote preferences. We agree with Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011) that economic voting can be viewed as a multidimensional phenomenon. What we wish to argue in this article is that the valence model of economic voting can itself be understood as being multidimensional if we integrate a second valence dimension to it, namely that of party competence.",1
57,10,"According to the current valence interpretation of economic voting, when casting their ballot citizens are mostly concerned with the incumbent party＊s economic record over the past year or so. Valence models of political choice (for example, Clarke et al, 2004, 2009) suggest that voters can very much consider the incumbent＊s comparative performance and reputation as well when making up their mind about which party to vote for. In fact, in recent years a growing number of studies about the impact of the economy on the vote have highlighted another dimension of economic voting that is related to the political parties＊ image of competence at dealing with the economy (Sanders, 1999; Bellucci, 2006; Butt, 2006; Smith, 2007; Martinsson, 2009; B谷langer and G谷lineau, 2010, 2011).",1
57,11,"In a context of financial crisis, when the state of the economy does not really give an electoral advantage to the incumbent party, we can expect that the incumbent may try to campaign on an issue other than the economy (Vavreck, 2009) or that it may still campaign on the economy 每 but by framing that issue in a more favorable way, that is, in a way that would allow the incumbent party to project an image of itself that is more positive than that of its opponents (Nadeau et al, 2010). A party＊s economic competence can thus become a key component of its campaign message.",1
57,12,"This second valence dimension of the economy is retrospective in nature. But it differs from the traditional valence dimension in one important respect. While the traditional dimension is solely concerned with the incumbent party＊s economic record, the competence dimension is more comparative in nature. It involves assessments of the incumbent＊s economic performance as compared with other economies. The question that the voter asks becomes: Does the nation＊s economy, despite its difficult situation, nonetheless show a better performance than comparable (for example, neighboring) economies? If it does, then the voter concludes that the incumbent party did relatively well under the difficult circumstances and may decide to support it despite the crisis context and its impact on the national economy. Kayser and Peress (2012) refer to this cognitive process as ＆benchmarking＊ while Duch and Stevenson (2010) conceptualize it as the extraction by voters of signals about the government＊s relative economic competence.",1
57,13,"This dimension thus relates to the competence-based component of issue ownership, which rests on the parties＊ performance at handling specific issues and can be assessed via comparison, and especially via benchmarking in the case of the economy. It must be distinguished from the ＆associative＊ component of issue ownership that mainly involves the history of attention given to specific issues by parties through their policy priorities, and which has less to do with performance per se (on this crucial distinction, see Walgrave et al, 2012). This distinction between valence and policy dimensions of issue ownership mirrors the one that we drew in the previous section between the traditional economic voting hypothesis and Kiewiet＊s (1983) policy-oriented view of economic voting.",1
57,14,"Together with Martinsson (2009, p. 230), we argue that issue ownership constitutes an important factor that helps to account for why incumbents might not be punished for objectively poor economic performances. Other studies having tried to account for this phenomenon have tended to highlight various institutional and contextual factors (see the review in Anderson, 2007); but they have not looked at the parties＊ image of economic manager. We believe issue ownership to be another significant factor of economic voting.",1
57,15,"We expect that such a competence dimension influenced incumbent voting in the 2008 and 2011 Canadian federal elections: perceptions of the incumbent party as being the most competent at managing the economy should increase the likelihood of voters supporting the Conservative Party while perceptions of an opposition party as being the most competent should decrease it. B谷langer and G谷lineau (2011) examined similar effects in the context of a single subnational election (the 2008 Quebec one). Martinsson＊s (2009) study looked at six Swedish national elections, but focused on the specific issue of unemployment. Our own study looks at competence on the economy more broadly defined, for two consecutive Canadian national elections.",1
57,16,"As indicators of retrospective sociotropic economic assessments, we use two measures in turn. We first use the classic measure based on the usual question: ＆Over the past year, has Canada＊s economy gotten better, gotten worse or stayed about the same?＊ (better = +1, same = 0, worse = ?1). This indicator should allow us to capture the traditional economic voting effect. That said, in their own investigation of economic voting in the 2008 Canadian election, Gidengil et al (2012, p. 77) report only a weak effect when using this measure. They go on to argue that the reason for such a modest economic voting effect is that many voters did not blame the Conservative government for the country＊s economic downturn, since the financial crisis had mainly erupted in the United States (Gidengil et al, 2012, pp. 79每82). For this reason, we develop a second measure of retrospective economic evaluations that takes into account responsibility attribution. This ＆economic responsibility＊ measure weights the original variable of economic perceptions on the basis of whether the respondent actually attributes responsibility for good (or bad) national economic conditions to the government＊s policies.",1
57,17,"Our indicator of political parties＊ image as competent economic managers is based on answers to the following question: ＆In your view, which party would be best at dealing with the economy?＊2 Since our dependent variable is dichotomous (voted for the Conservative Party or for another party) we code the competence variable as follows: Conservatives named as competent = +1, another party named as competent = ?1; none are competent, all about the same, don＊t know = 0. (For a similar three-category coding of party competence, see B谷langer and Meguid (2008); B谷langer and G谷lineau (2011)). This question is available in both surveys. However, in 2008 it is asked only to one half of the sample (random split-sample experiment). The question asked to respondents from the other half of the sample refers instead to job creation (＆... would be best at creating jobs?＊). Since the issue of job creation is relevant to the economic crisis context, we also consider this second aspect of economic competence in our analysis as additional evidence of economic voting on the basis of competence assessments.",1
57,18,"The 2008 Canadian federal election was called by Prime Minister Stephen Harper right before the economic crisis erupted in the American housing and financial markets. Canadians went to the polls on 14 October, having in mind this crisis context and being aware that the Canadian economy had started to slow down and was possibly about to collapse, to some extent, over the coming months. According to the CES data, 81 per cent of respondents outside Quebec stated that the issue of the economy was very important for them in that election, with an additional 17 per cent saying that it was somewhat important.3 Not surprisingly given the start of the economic downturn, 46 per cent of respondents thought that Canada＊s economy had deteriorated over the past year, 39 per cent thought that it had stayed the same, while only 14 per cent said that it had improved. The traditional economic voting hypothesis would lead us to expect these negative economic evaluations to have hurt the incumbent Conservatives.",1
57,19,"The regression model presented in Column 2 of Table 1 substitutes the traditional 3-point measure of past economic assessments for this 5-point economic responsibility measure (although keep in mind that both indicators have been standardized to run from ?1 to +1). The results are clear. Economic voting appears as substantial as in the first model when one uses the economic responsibility indicator. This result is in line with Gidengil et al＊s (2012) intuition about the nature of economic voting within the context of the 2008 Canadian election. Certainly, in times of global economic crisis, an incumbent government cannot be held entirely accountable for a country＊s worsening economic conditions; only those voters who blame its policies can be expected to cast a vote against it, which is what the economic responsibility indicator attempts to capture. To be clear, economic voting did occur in 2008 and it hurt the incumbent party since most Canadian voters thought that economic conditions had deteriorated, or at least had not improved. It is simply that it occurred most strongly among the smaller group of people who attributed credit or blame to the government＊s policies, everything else being equal.",1
57,20,"That said, we note that the difference between the two models of Table 1 in terms of model fit is extremely small. This suggests that the contribution of responsibility attributions to the traditional economic voting effect is rather modest. Responsibility attributions do add an important nuance to the effect, but they do not increase the explanatory power of the model by much. As we have argued at the outset of this article, it seems that a focus on retrospective economic perceptions alone can only offer an incomplete account of economic voting, especially in times of financial crisis. As hypothesized, during hard times, perceptions of party competence at managing the economy can have either a counteracting effect or a reinforcing effect.",1
57,21,"How much of an effect do these two valence dimensions of economic voting actually have on the probability to support the incumbent party, everything else being equal? To illustrate this impact in more concrete ways, we convert the results into marginal effects based on our logistic regression results. We do so for the enhanced valence model of economic voting as estimated for 2008 (first column of Table 4) but the results are very similar if one uses instead the 2011 regression results of Table 7 as a basis, or those of the jobs creation model of 2008 (second column of Table 4). We keep all the other independent variables at their mean values while we change the values of retrospective national economic evaluations (the version weighted by responsibility attribution) and party competence on the economy and compute the corresponding change in the predicted probability to vote for the incumbent party. These simulation results appear in Table 8.",1
58,1,"The standard neoclassical approach to economic theorizing excludes, by definition, economic emergence and the related phenomenon of entrepreneurship. We explore how the most economic of human behaviours, entrepreneurship, came to be largely excluded from mainstream economic theory. In contrast, we report that evolutionary economists have acknowledged the importance of understanding emergence and we explore the advances that have been made in this regard. We go on to argue that evolutionary economics can make further progress by taking a more ＆naturalistic＊ approach to economic evolution. This requires that economic analysis be fully embedded in complex economic system theory and that associated understandings as to how humans react to states of uncertainty be explicitly dealt with. We argue that ＆knowledge,＊ because of the existence of uncertainty is, to a large degree ＆conjectural＊ and, thus, is closely linked to our emotional states. Our economic behaviour is also influenced by the reality that we, and the systems that we create, are dissipative structures. Thus, we introduce the notions of ＆energy gradients＊ and ＆knowledge gradients＊ as essential concepts in understanding economic emergence and resultant economic growth.",1
58,2,"Conventional neoclassical economics has at its core the presumption that economic decision making is a matter of cold logic, namely, the application of a constrained optimisation rule. Over the past three decades, this rule has become set, increasingly, in the context of strategic interactions although much of macroeconomics continues to apply it in the context of a single ＆representative agent.＊ Despite the analytical precision that such a rule provides, it can only approximate actual behaviour in historical time when there is either certainty or quantifiable risk, i.e., in ＆simplistic＊ contexts (Foster (2005)). It can only be used to calculate from calculable information. It cannot approximate economic decision-making when there is uncertainty, i.e., the absence of knowledge of the full set of events faced and the probabilities associated with them. Significant technological, organizational or institutional changes occur in states of uncertainty and, furthermore, these changes, in turn, can create new uncertainties in an economic system. This uncertainty does not prevent economic behaviour from occurring. On the contrary, we observe much creative and cooperative behaviour in states of uncertainty and the result is ＆economic emergence＊ whereby new network structures form with characteristics that are irreducible to the elements of which they are composed.",1
58,3,"The school of thought in which economic emergence has been addressed most directly is evolutionary economics. This has been possible because evolutionary economists are concerned with how economic systems are transformed from within; evolutionary theory is inherently a theory of change that reflects not one, but a range of behavioural rules that are adopted and applied by economic decision-makers. For example, Nelson and Winter (1982) stressed the centrality of behavioural routines once it is accepted that decisionmakers have to operate in the reality of historical time, with all its attendant uncertainties. In evolutionary economics, economic agents are viewed as reducing the uncertainty that they face and achieving economic goals by adhering to bundles of rules. Economic emergence occurs as radically new bundles of rules form into capital goods (technological rules), productive networks (organisational rules), contracting systems (institutional rules) and human skills (procedural rules). This is a process of ＆selforganization＊ and it is honed by a process of ＆competitive selection＊ whereby particular technologies, organisational structures, institutions and procedures come to dominate.",1
58,4,"This perspective on economic emergence requires an understanding of both the genetic and culturally acquired drivers of human behaviour, honed in our anthropological history, and how these interface with the energetic requirements of living, dissipative systems. Correspondingly, the institutional rules that humans adopt in their various cultures, and how these change as circumstances change, have to be understood before we can analyse economic behaviour. This does not imply that conventional economic analysis should be rejected since humans clearly attempt to do the best they can within the circumstances that they face. Thus, the issue is not optimisation per se but rather the limits to calculative behaviour and the different ways in which individuals can respond to the information at their disposal. Thus, all evolutionary theories place the diversity of behaviours, rather than uniformity of behaviour, at their cores. So, whether or not behaviour is ＆optimal,＊ by some logical criterion, is very much a secondary question. .",1
58,5,"The remainder of the article is organised as follows. In Section 2 we provide a historical overview of why economists have found it so difficult to capture emergence in economic analysis. For the heterodox economist, this overview is likely to cover material that is familiar but, for the benefit of younger mainstream readers, it seems worthwhile to provide some motivation for what follows. In Section 3, we discuss how evolutionary economists have dealt with economic emergence over the years. Again, this is in the style of an overview of the main points of differentiation with the mainstream rather than a comprehensive review. Section 4 focuses on the key catalyst of economic emergence, widely regarded as pivotal by evolutionary economists inspired by Joseph Schumpeter, namely, entrepreneurship. In Section 5 we seek to grasp why people are impelled to take large entrepreneurial risks in the face of radical uncertainty and to assess how this kind of behaviour can be captured using complex adaptive systems theory Section 6 contains some concluding remarks.",1
58,6,"So economics in the 1950s moved inexorably towards a body of logic in which emergent phenomena could not be accommodated. From a scientific perspective, this was a quite remarkable trend because it meant that what are patently core drivers of economic evolution and growth, came to be ignored in favour of the mathematics of constrained optimisation, cast in a ＆force field＊ representation of a fully connected network system imported from 19th Century physics (Mirowski (1989) and Potts (2000)). Back in the 1950s, it did not look like this kind of economic analysis would come to dominate. The ＆Keynesian revolution＊ had raised fundamental questions concerning the validity of neoclassical economics as an adequate representation of economic behaviour. Although, microeconomics remained firmly in the neoclassical tradition, short, medium and long term macroeconomics took on a distinctly non-neoclassical flavour. For example, the medium term multiplier-accelerator representation of the business cycle became popular and Harrod＊s theory (Harrod (1948)) became the baseline in the field of economic growth, with the related Harrod-Domar representation the preferred analytical basis of development planning.",1
58,7,"Instead of trying to find ways of dealing with technological change in their growth models, neoclassical economists argued that what were required were better ＆microfoundations＊ for macroeconomics. This view had already gained a foothold after Keynes＊ death through the widespread acceptance of the ＆neoclassical synthesis＊ interpretation of the Keynesian model, originally promulgated by John Hicks (Hicks (1937)). So, neoclassical economists found it relatively easy to advance into the fields of business cycle and growth theory in the following decades. The dynamical mathematical representations of the cycle and growth that had emerged were messy, complex, often did not have equilibrium solutions and were very difficult to verify empirically. Neoclassical economists sought to circumvent these difficulties with simple ＆representative optimizing agent＊ analytical foundations that were easy to understand and apply if suitably strong ＆simplifying＊ assumptions were made. In no sense could these advancing theories deal with economic emergence because the representative agent is a uniform agent, so there can be no possible connection to Schumpeter＊s entrepreneur or the ＆Marshallian flux＊ and the differentiated firm (Metcalfe (2007)).",1
58,8,"The economics discipline consolidated its constrained optimisation core in the second half of the 20th century partly because of an anxiety to be recognisably ＆scientific.＊ Samuelson, Arrow and Debreu replaced Veblen, Marshall and Schumpeter at the intellectual core and not only did this disconnect economics from economic emergence but it also made economists reluctant to accept the importance of behavioural traits beyond narrow neoclassical definitions of rationality. This was amply demonstrated recently in the blindness of the majority of economists to the impending global financial crisis in the first decade of the 21st Century (Akerlof and Shiller (2009)). Decades previously, John Maynard Keynes, very perceptively, had argued that business investment was driven by ＆animal spirits＊ and that the resultant waves of optimism and pessimism caused fluctuations in economic growth. But the neoclassical synthesis had eliminated this attempt by Keynes to capture a particular kind of emergence. Instead, the Keynesian story became depicted as one of labour market failure in an otherwise wellfunctioning neoclassical (non-) world. ",1
58,9,"By the early 1990s, endogenous growth theorists would claim that Solow＊s unexplained residual could be explained by introducing ＆knowledge＊ as an additional factor of production with unusual characteristics that yield economies of scale or spill-over externalities. In this neoclassically-based theory, a ＆stock＊ of knowledge is generated by R&D, involving researchers incentivised to discover inventions that can be innovated into new capital equipment to sell to consumer goods producers. As usual, some clever assumptions and functional forms are required to make the theory work and what did it tell us? Only general things we already knew: investment in education and training matters, it is important to promote and facilitate innovation, patents are socially beneficial but mustn＊t be over-protective. By definition, equilibrium endogenous growth theory lacks any explanation of the process of economic emergence, yet it aspires to be explanatory. Most notably, the key agent of economic progress, entrepreneurship is virtually ignored.",1
58,10,"However, the mathematical representation of processes such as competition and innovation does not wholly eliminate their emergent character. In the contemporary lexicon of emergence, they capture ＆weak＊ emergence not the ＆strong＊ emergence that we associate with, for example, Schumpeterian radical innovation and associated entrepreneurship (see Corning (2002)). All emergent processes and the economic growth trajectories that they shadow, must have a deterministic component because of the fact that economic systems are dissipative structures and, as such, have to remain structurally coherent and, to some degree, be irreversible over historical time (Foster and Wild (1999a)). This structural persistence has a mathematical structure that can be estimated parametrically using econometrics. But such quantitative modelling of a growth trajectory remains, necessarily, an incomplete representation of an evolutionary process that involves structural change. By implication, the statistical residuals in a logistic diffusion model that has been estimated econometrically must contain all the nondeterministic components of an emergence process, in addition to normal Gaussian stochasticity (see Foster and Wild, 1999b).",1
58,11,"Thus, there is little doubt that evolutionary economists have been successful in dealing with weak emergence in both their theorising and in empirical applications. They have also understood the importance of strong emergence and recognised that it is the source of economic evolution and growth. Since the seminal contributions of Joseph Schumpeter, it has been accepted that the generation of novelty via entrepreneurship is the pivotal catalyst in economic emergence. But this has been very difficult for evolutionary economists to deal with analytically (Witt (2009b)). Clearly, this is a field in evolutionary economics that requires further development before a full treatment of economic emergence can be delivered.",1
58,12,"Emergence involves, among other things (Harper and Endres (2011), wholes being more than the sum of their parts. This is, of course an old idea (Lewes (1875)) and is recognised in mainstream economics in the context of economies of scale and scope and learning, or experience, curves. However, as noted, these are generally kept outside the constrained optimization body of theory. In contrast, both in evolutionary economics and in business strategy, analysis of these processes is central and tends to centre on the operation of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial individuals or groups in organizations take on the difficult task of: setting up networks of connections between elements, such as machines (embodying physical technologies) and people (embodying skills); using sets of organizational rules (social technologies); and accessing appropriate and affordable energy sources. There have been a number of contributions in this field by evolutionary economists generally adopting either a case study methodology, agent-based simulation or some combination of both (see, for example, Malerba et al (2001) and Foster and Potts (2009)). ",1
58,13,"Historical lock in, because of the complexity of physical, cultural, conceptual and organisational structure that has been built up successfully, is always present and this limits the firm＊s room for manoeuvre. Here there is an evolutionary dilemma - increased efficiency tends to be achieved by creating tighter specialised connections in networks, but specialised organizations are generally less flexible than loose groups of unspecialized individuals, making adaptation in maturity more difficult to achieve. There is always far more adaptive potential in an industry than there is in any individual firm and far more adaptive potential in the economy as a whole. So, again, being overly rational in the neoclassical sense can be a handicap. A common case cited in the field of business strategy is that of IBM which achieved high levels of organisational efficiency but became incapable of adaptation (Foster and Kaplan (2001)). So an entirely separate branch had to be created to innovate and create the personal computer. In complexity theory, it has been long recognised that the optimisation of a whole system generally involves suboptimal behaviour in its individual components.",1
59,1,"The recent moves of the Indian economy towards further opening up of the economy with less government control has brought about changes in its policy structure. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that greater economic freedom leads to higher levels of economic growth in a federal system like India where business regulations, taxation, and government spending differ widely across states. Pooled linear regression model is applied to categorical data containing economic freedom and its three components as independent variables, and growth rates of income per capita and gross state domestic product as dependent variable, for a panel of twenty states for three time periods, 2004/2005, 2006/2007 and 2009/2010. While examining this relationship, the variables like initial income per capita, initial literacy rate, sectoral composition, and inflation rate are taken as control. The results tend to establish the fundamental effects of economic freedom in fostering economic growth. Three individual dimensions of economic freedom namely size of government, strong rule of law, and flexible regulations governing credit, labour, and product markets are likely to exert beneficial impacts on income growth. ",1
59,2,"It is widely established that market-driven reforms foster economic development (Berggren 2003). Market liberalization and building institutions for market are considered as crucial elements of Washington-consensus (World Bank 2002) under which adjustment programmes of international organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank are designed to help free an economy from excessive government intervention. According to the World Bank (2002), market-based institutions help transmit information efficiently, enforce property rights and contracts, and secure competition, thereby influencing economic development (De Vanssay and Spindler 1994; Alesina 1998; De Haan and Siermann 1998; Nelson and Singh 1998). These institutions tend to promote economic freedom and have the credibility to make the growth-enhancing incentives available through low taxation, independent legal system and protection of private property (Murphy et al. 1991; Gwartney 2009). They encourage dynamic and organised economies, where free and fair competitions exist, thanks to effective regulations. Government enterprises are less in number in such economies (Johansson 2001).",1
59,3,"As early as in the late 1980s, the Indian economy evidently witnessed a gradual transformation with trade liberalization, slow but steady deregulation of investment along with output control. Since 1991, with the adoption of new economic reform programmes, the economy has made a clear-cut transition from a state-led development model to a neoliberal paradigm. Consequently, the country has registered a great deal of changes, both internally and externally, while ensuring greater visibility of ＆invisible hands＊ of free and competitive market economy (Ghosh and Chandrasekhar 2007). Growth rates of India＊s national and per capita incomes have been quite impressive during the period of economic liberalization. Subsequent measures towards further opening up of the economy with less government control seem to have brought about changes in the policy structure with respect to the size of government〞expenditures, taxes and enterprises〞, legal structure and security of property rights as well as regulation of labour and business (Debroy et al. 2011).",1
59,4,"Economic freedom implies the degree to which a market economy is in place, where the central components are voluntary exchange, free competition, and protection of persons and property (Gwartney et al. 1996). The primary goal is to characterize the institutional structure as central to economic policy (North 1990). The incentives economic actors (entrepreneurs, innovators, financiers, industrialists, and others) achieve are determined, in large part, by the existence of institutions (North 1990), which may or may not be efficient.",1
59,5,"Economic freedom, as originally defined by Fraser Institute, entails five important components viz. (a) size of government (b) legal structure and security of property rights (c) access to sound money, (d) freedom to trade internationally, and (e) regulation of credit, labour and business (Gwartney et al. 2010). Within these broad components lie many sub-components and 42 distinct variables, each having its own implications. In ＆Economic Freedom of the World Report＊ of Fraser Institute, each component and sub-component is placed on a scale of 0每10 reflecting the distribution of the underlying data. Each sub-component and component is averaged to derive the ratings and economic freedom of each country. A separate index of economic freedom is also brought out annually by the Heritage Foundation in partnership with the Wall Street Journal. However, the philosophical underpinnings, by and large, remain the same in both the indices (Debroy et al. 2011).",1
59,6,"Since the time of Adam Smith, there has been a line of reasoning that economic freedom〞understood in Hayek＊s sense as ＆absence of coercion＊〞has the ability to promote growth and affluence (Prokopijevic 2002). There are strong evidences of a close statistical correlation between economic freedom and growth (Hanke and Walters 1997). As economic freedom entails competition, there can be potent reasons to expect that free economies grow faster than those that are less free (Gwartney et al. 2010). In general, competition leads to higher economic growth. A liberal economy provides greater opportunities for entrepreneurial discoveries and helps channelize private investments toward the areas experiencing higher rate of return (Parente and Prescott 2000). While economic freedom per se is a critical indicator, its individual components are likely to exert varied impacts on the health of the economy (Ayal and Karras 1998; Heckelman and Stroup 2000; Carlsson and Lundstrom 2002; Dawson 2003; Berggren and Jordahl 2006) (Fig. 1).",1
59,7,"There seems to be a broad consensus that security of property rights is crucial for economic growth (Parente and Prescott 2000). Secure and transferable rights over assets and contracts are investment-generating and hence growth-enhancing, as owners are assured of receiving the benefits of their investments. With security of property rights, the allocation of assets also becomes efficient and hence, it becomes growth-promoting (World Bank 2002). Savings can be transferred to activities with the highest expected profits. Security of property rights with a well functioning legal structure may act as a necessary complementary institution to other components of economic freedom (Rodrik 2000).",1
59,8,"Access to sound money is yet another area of economic freedom, which puts thrust primarily on the costs of inflation. There are ample reasons why especially high and volatile inflation will have a negative impact on growth (Briault 1995). However, Akerlof et al. (1996) argue that a moderate level of inflation provides ＆grease＊ to the price and wage setting processes. The economic adjustment of relative prices to shocks can become sluggish in the presence of downward nominal rigidities in wages and prices. A moderate level of inflation provides some real wage flexibility, which reduces the natural or long run rate of unemployment (Loboguerrero and Panizza 2003). The empirical evidences on the inflation-growth nexus is thus somewhat mixed.",1
59,9,"Freedom to trade internationally may indicate that there are efficiency effects from trade liberalization. The interaction with global market through trade liberalization may bring about diffusion of technology. With international competition in the background, free trade enhances the productivity of the domestic firms, if exchange is done according to comparative advantages (Greenaway et al. 2002). The debate on the relationship between trade liberalization and economic growth is, however, still inconclusive (Sachs and Warner 1995; Rodriguez and Rodrik 2001). Some studies (Greenaway et al. 2002) report evidences in support of a positive linkage, while others are skeptical (Yanikkaya 2003).",1
59,10,"Regulation of labour, credit, and business is yet another dimension of economic freedom. There is a broad consensus that less regulation, in general, becomes beneficial to growth (Calmfors and Driffill 1988; Baumol et al. 2007). Unfriendly labour laws and concomitant labour strikes and industrial disputes hamper the business. Lack of adequate infrastructure and raw materials may also hinder control over the business. Higher transaction costs impose constraints on carrying out trade and economic activities, thereby serving as restraints on economic freedom of agents (Debroy et al. 2011).",1
59,11,"For undertaking state-wise analysis in India, economic freedom indices considered are taken from Economic Freedom of Indian states, 2011 (Debroy et al. 2011) for the year 2005, 2007 and 2009. The Indian economic freedom index is based on only three important parameters namely size of government, legal structure and security of property rights, and regulation of business and labour. It considers 20 states for which relevant data are available.",1
59,12,"It may be noted here that the areas for which the India＊s economic freedom index is constructed are derived from the Economic Freedom of the World Report constructed by the Fraser Institute. This ensures that the economic freedom rating for Indian states has measures that are somewhat comparable with those for other countries. However, given Indian conditions and the nature of the sharing of responsibilities between the states and the centre, only above-mentioned three dimensions are found to be appropriate. Evidently, in these dimensions, state governments have been given powers to directly affect conditions and institutions (Table 6). These three areas are designed in a way to measure almost all the major aspects of economic freedom of the respective states of the country. The rating scale of the economic freedom index ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 representing the lowest degree of economic freedom and 1 the highest. In order to find out the impact of economic freedom on economic growth, growth of per capita gross state domestic product (GSDP) and growth rate of GSDP are considered and the data pertaining to that were collected from the Central Statistical Office (CSO), Government of India.",1
59,13,"The present study considers the level of economic freedom index rather than its change, though the letter could have been more useful. Since data pertaining to freedom index in Indian context is available only for 3 years, estimation of changes would reduce the data period to two only, thus reducing the number of observations. It may be noted that studies in the past have also considered the level rather than the change (Ayal and Karras 1998; Heckelman 2000). On the basis of earlier empirical evidences, the present study assumes a priori that economic freedom influences growth, but not the other way round (De Vanssay and Spindler 1994; Ayal and Karras 1998; Heckelman 2000; Dawson 2003). Consequently, the model is not tested for endogeneity and only linear multiple regression model is proposed.",1
59,14,"It may be recapitulated that higher degrees of economic freedom are associated with higher rates of economic growth. The (direct) channel of such association could be the ＆productivity effect＊. Since many of the freedom index variables amount to measures of price distortion, leading to effects on efficiency in the allocation of resources, it is likely that economic freedom exerts positive effects on economic growth (Cole 2005).",1
59,15,"With regard to individual components, it may be hypothesized that a smaller sized government, better legal provisions and security of property rights, and higher flexibility and state intervention in credit and labour market, and business will ensure higher economic growth in India. In the neoclassical growth models of Solow每Swan and Ramsey, an exogenously higher value of the rule of law indicator tends to raise the steady-state level of output per effective worker. Similarly, a higher ratio of (nonproductive) government consumption to GDP seems to depress the steady-state level of output per effective worker, thereby reducing the growth rate. In the former case, the growth rate increases, while in the latter, it decreases, for given values (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004).",1
59,16,"Interference of the government in the functioning of the economy or a larger role of the government as a producer and a provider of goods and services or as a redistributor of resources reduces the level of economic freedom (Debroy et al. 2011). Rise in size of government in terms of expenditure, for instance, may entail distortion of private decisions. These distortions can affect governmental activities themselves and also involve the adverse effects from the associated public finance (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004). This dimension of freedom is intended to capture the idea that the role of the government in a free economy is to provide functions that are protective and productive. Government expenditures beyond these basic functions and transferring the resources between tax payers are considered as impinging on economic freedom (Compton et al. 2011). In essence, small government size is needed for raising economic freedom, while large size reflects more resource reallocation and intrusion into the private market which may lower freedom. In the formulation of freedom index, such non-linear relationship between size of government and economic freedom seems to have been considered in the background.",1
59,17,Flexibility in labour market is the key to the success of any business. It may indicate capacity of the entrepreneurs to adopt changes needed for their enterprises to grow (Altman 2007). Freedom to entrepreneurs to rationalize the labour base and exit market may enhance business capabilities. Entrepreneurs may also fail if there are constraints in terms of infrastructure and raw materials (Debroy et al. 2011).,1
59,18,"Volatility in the money market may lead to uncertainties. Inflation is an indicator of such volatility and it also reflects macroeconomic instability. There are, however, conflicting views on the role of inflation in output growth. Inflation can create two kinds of effects namely ＆grease effect＊ (Tobin 1972) and ＆sand effect＊ (Friedman 1977). While grease effect indicates that inflation can speed up the adjustment to long-run equilibrium, sand effect speculates the possibility of resource misallocation, leading to deceleration in growth. In the empirical literature on developed countries, grease effect plays a predominant role, while in developing countries, sand effect assumes significance (Loboguerrero and Panizza 2003). One point of argument is that high inflation rates tend to distort price signals and relative prices due to inefficient allocation of resources (Akerlof et al. 1996). Real net return on investment seems to decrease in higher inflationary environment. Consequently, investment and economic growth are likely to decline in the long run. Contrarily, it may be argued that as money could act as a substitute for capital, favourable impact of inflation cannot be ruled out (Tobin 1980). With these inconclusive findings, the impact of inflation on economic growth remains an empirical question. ",1
59,19,"Structure of an economy also assumes significance in the context of economic growth. In this respect, sectoral composition, reflecting industry mix, may be considered as a useful indicator. It may be ascertained that structural change in favour of fast-growing sectors may lead to improvement in growth and per capita income (Mourre 2006). While most of the earlier studies have incorporated the share of services into the model to find out the role of such compositional effects, in the context of the Indian economy, the role of manufacturing as an employmentgenerating sector can be considered as crucial as the fast-growing service sector (Padalino and Vivarelli 1997; Kapsos 2005). In order to understand the compositional effects, shares of employment for the secondary and tertiary sectors are taken as two independent factors. The expected sign of each variable is not clear (Garrett and Rhine 2011) and it may depend on the relative size of each sector and the employment dynamics in all other sectors (Elhorst 2003). Hence, the possible impact of shares of industry and services on growth in India remains an empirical question.",1
59,20,"Yet another important determinant of growth is the level of human capital. If more investment is made in human capital, economic growth rates are likely to be higher, at least until the steady state is reached (Galor and Zeira 1993; Piketty 1997). The presence of human capital may relax the constraint of diminishing returns to physical capital and can lead thereby to long-term per capita growth in the absence of exogenous technological progress. Hence, the production of human capital may act as an alternative to improvements in technology and in turn, as a mechanism to generate long-term growth. The growth rates tend to rise with the amount of the imbalance between human and physical capital if human capital is abundant relative to physical capital, but they tend to fall with the amount of the imbalance if human capital is relatively scarce. Accordingly, it may be argued that an economy can recover faster in response to a war that destroys mainly physical capital than to an epidemic that destroys mainly human capital (Barro and Sala-iMartin 2004). Greater availability of human capital can reduce a country＊s costs of adopting sophisticated techniques or, equivalently, raises the return to this adoption (Caselli and Coleman 2001). ",1
59,21,"Since 1991, India has introduced several liberalization measures, both internally and externally. The period since then has witnessed two phases of reforms, often termed in academic circle as first and second generation reforms (Jha 2009; Debroy et al. 2011). First generation reforms put more emphasis on the external sector (where the first flush of reforms was introduced), while second generation reforms pertain more to the domestic economy. Besides, first generation reforms often refer to agendas that are under the purview of the central government (viz. product markets), whereas second generation reforms primarily emphasize on issues falling under the purview of the states (viz. markets for land and labour).",1
59,22,"It is interesting to note that these reforms, in course of time, have brought about significant improvements in the scores of economic freedom, with the values rising from 5.1 in 1990 to 6.4 in 2008 (Table 1). Commensurately, all the individual indicators of economic freedom except ＆access to sound money＊ have shown constant improvements. The individual indices measure the extent of freedom from restrictions imposed by government (Debroy et al. 2011) on different pertinent aspects.",1
59,23,"India is a large country encompassing perceptible differences across its constituent states, possibly due to differences in their socio-political and institutional arrangements. Therefore, the national scenario may not truly represent the scenarios of the states. Moreover, economic reform programmes have not made equal dent across all the states of the country. While some states have been more pro-active towards adopting reforms agendas, some others have been laggards consistently. Consequently, some states are found to be economically freer than others and some states have grown faster than others. The study on economic freedom and growth thus needs to focus on these inter-state differences.",1
59,24,"The key variables of interest in this study are economic freedom and economic freedom indices. The results regarding the effects of overall economic freedom on economic growth are presented in column 1 of Table 2. The coefficient of the overall economic freedom index is positive and significant, indicating thereby that higher levels of economic freedom tend to achieve higher economic growth across the states.",1
59,25,"The results of the economic freedom indices for three different components are shown in columns 2, 3 and 4 of Table 2 respectively. Considering economic freedom index for the size of government, the fundamental assertion is that lesser government intervention, indicating high economic freedom, may lead to higher economic growth. The coefficient of this index is positive and significant, revealing thereby that states with lower government spending as a share of the total, smaller government enterprise sector and lower marginal tax rates are likely to accomplish greater economic growth. The coefficient of legal structure and security of property rights is positive and significant. The primary assertion could be that ensuring law and order, and protecting property is a core governance area. Regulation of labour and business exerts direct impact on economic growth. This area of economic freedom reflects state intervention in labour markets, and bureaucratic and procedural costs, including physical infrastructure. It may be stated that high flexibility in labour market tends to enhance output growth. All the three areas of economic freedom indices are also taken simultaneously to check the robustness of the model (Table 2, column 5) and the results, by and large, remain the same.",1
59,26,"Share of tertiary sector employment directly affects India＊s per capita income growth. However, secondary sector＊s share does not seem to be relevant. The primary motive behind the introduction of tertiary and secondary sector＊s share into the growth model is to examine the net compositional effects on account of shifts of people from low productive agriculture to high productive secondary and tertiary sector (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991). Currently, India＊s growth story is attributed, in large part, to the growth of the tertiary sector, which is evident from the rising share of the tertiary sector to the country＊s GDP. As the tertiary sector＊s growth and employment therein are led by information and communication technology (ICT), the result also indicates the predominant role of ICT in propelling growth in India.",1
59,27,"Literacy rate, considered as a proxy for human capital, also stands out to be an important determinant of economic growth. The coefficient of the initial literacy rate is positive, indicating thereby that the states with higher amount of human capital at the starting point are likely to achieve higher growth. This may signify that human capital may act as complementary to physical capital and hence, it may have the ability to postpone the occurrence of diminishing returns to reproducible capital (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991).",1
59,28,"Interestingly, the growth rate of per capita income of the Indian states is found to be positively related to their initial levels of per capita incomes. This tends to suggest that states with initially high per capita incomes tend to grow faster than their counterparts with low per capita incomes, hence corroborating Rao et al. (1999). This finding is contrary to the predication of the neoclassical growth theory based on a critical assumption of diminishing returns to reproducible capital (Solow 1956). The result rather suggests increasing returns to the reproducible capital and divergence in economic growth across the states of India (Rao et al. 1999).",1
59,29,"The results clearly support the proposition that economic freedom enhances economic growth in India. What is interesting to find out is that all the three dimensions of economic freedom assume significance for the Indian states. It is thus prudent on the part of the nation and its constituent states to diminish the size of government and minimize government intervention in the free play of market forces. Flexible regulations governing credit, labour, and product markets are equally indispensable. The legal structure needs to be strengthened so that a better business-friendly environment is created across the states of India, which, in turn, is likely to foster growth.",1
60,1,"How do economic freedom and culture impact economic growth? This paper argues that culture, as measured by the World Values Surveys, and economic institutions associated with economic freedom are both independently important for economic prosperity, but the strength of their impact can be better understood only when both are included in the growth regression. Our results indicate that economic freedom is more important than culture for growth outcomes, suggesting substitutability between the two. We posit that culture is important for growth when economic freedom is absent, diminishing in significance once economic freedom is established.",1
60,2,"Economic institutions, such as private property, rule of law, and contract enforcement are extremely important for economic growth and development. As defined by North (1990), institutions can be thought of as the ※rules of the game,§ both formal and informal, which govern actions through incentives. Formal institutions are codified structures or written rules, whereas informal institutions are inclusive of cultures, norms, and conventions enforced by social custom. Economists independently link both formal and informal institutions to growth and development, but the relative effects of the two remain to be seen. Following this logic, we argue that economic institutions and culture both need to be accounted for when analyzing economic growth.",1
60,3,"The main goal of this study is to incorporate ＆cultural capital＊ into the freedom-growth framework. More generally, the analysis can be viewed as contributing to the literature attempting to understand how institutions matter for economic development. By controlling for both economic institutions and economic culture, we disentangle the relative effects of each and determine empirically the significances of their impacts on economic outcomes. This analysis can be viewed as providing insight into whether economic freedom and culture are complements or substitutes. Our main focus is on relative effects, not the interaction or feedback between culture and freedom, as a way of first uncovering how economic freedom and culture may affect economic prosperity.",1
60,4,"To do so, we use a fixed effects model from 1970 to 2004 and include several robustness checks. Our results suggest that, independently, both culture and economic freedom contribute to economic prosperity. However, once we control for both culture and economic freedom simultaneously, the strong association between culture and growth becomes much weaker, while, overwhelmingly, economic freedom retains a positive and highly significant relationship with economic growth. We view these results as suggesting that culture and economic freedom may act as substitutes where, in the absence of economic freedom, culture provides the core institutional functions such as protecting property rights and enforcing contracts; however, once the institutions associated with economic freedom are credible, there is less need to rely on the informal mechanisms of culture.",1
60,5,"As mentioned above, the direct link between economic freedom and growth is robustly discussed in previous literature. The theoretical underpinning regarding this link is also well established. As De Haan and Sturm (2000: 3) note, ※since the time of Adam Smith, if not before, economists and economic historians have argued that the freedom to choose and supply resources, competition in business, trade with others and secure property rights are central ingredients for economic progress.§",1
60,6,"In order to further understand how culture may affect economic growth, we narrow the concept to focus on several specific indicators of culture that are identified as being relevant for economic interaction and exchange. One can think of this subset as ＆economic culture,＊ defined by Porter (2000: 14) as ※the beliefs, attitudes, and values that bear on economic activities of individuals, organizations, and other institutions. This narrowing process enables us to provide a more in-depth analysis of the connection between culture and economic growth§ (Patterson 2000).",1
60,7,"Our economic culture variable is based on the methodology found in Tabellini (2008a, 2009) and is constructed by identifying four distinct categories of culture that should shape behavior related to social and economic interaction and, thus, economic growth and development. These four components are trust, respect, individual self-determination, and obedience, which serve as rules governing interaction between individuals, including market production and entrepreneurship. In general, trust, respect, and individual self-determination are thought to stimulate social and economic interaction, whereas obedience is thought to limit economic interaction and development by decreasing risk-taking, a trait essential to entrepreneurship",1
60,8,"Self-determination is a quantitative measure of the amount of control individuals feel they have over individual choices and their lives. If individuals view economic success or failure as a result of their own efforts (i.e., high levels of self-determination), they will work harder in order to earn a greater payoff for their productivity and increase their welfare. According to this line of reasoning, the greater an individual＊s ＆locus of control,＊ the greater the overall level of economic development in their country (Banfield 1958).",1
60,9,"Theoretically, the relationship between economic freedom and culture could reasonably be expected to go either way〞they may be substitutes or complements. As discussed above, both culture and economic freedom independently affect economic growth. Once both are included in the same regression, if either culture or freedom dominates the other, this suggests that the two are substitutes. However, if both remain significant, culture and freedom are complementing one another in supporting economic growth.",1
60,10,"For example, a culture conducive to economic growth may choose to formalize the informal institutions into institutions associated with economic freedom. Once the formal rules are credible, the informal norms and mechanisms once relied upon for economic interaction and exchange, such as trust networks, may be rendered much less important. If this is the case, economic freedom should dominate culture in the growth regression, suggesting a substitution effect.",1
60,11,"On the other hand, there also are ample reasons for thinking that these two key variables are complements and should both be significant in the growth regression. Culture or economic freedom may, independently, contribute to economic growth, but their independent effects might be far weaker than the impact of having both formal and informal institutions of freedom. For example, a culture rich in trust prompts some exchanges, yet the combination of a trusting culture and a government that enforces laws against predation and honoring private property rights is the key to sustained and large-scale economic growth. Several studies show that culture enhances economic freedom and vice versa (for example, see Berggren and Jordahl 2006; Heinemann and Tanz 2008; Tabellini 2008b; Aghion et al. 2009).",1
60,12,"To measure economic freedom, we utilize the well-cited and established Economic Freedom of the World Index compiled by the Fraser Institute (Gwartney et al. 2008). The index measures the level of economic freedom, utilizing 42 different components, on a scale from zero to ten, with ten representing a greater degree of freedom. These components can be grouped into five broad categories: size of government, monetary policy and price stability, legal structure and security of private ownership, freedom to trade with foreigners, and regulation of credit, labor, and business. Each of these categories represents a subset of the variables used to construct the broader index of economic freedom.",1
60,13,"We include the investment share as one of our standard control variables because of the well-documented positive relationship between the rate of investment in physical capital and the rate of growth (Levine and Renelt 1992). However, we acknowledge a potential endogeneity problem, as highlighted by De Haan et al. (2006), of including both economic freedom and the investment rate in the same regression. Several studies show that economic freedom influences growth directly through a productivity-enhancing channel and indirectly through an investment effect (Dawson 1998; Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles 2003;Gwartney et al. 2004). We include investment in our main specification but address the endogeneity concern in a later section.",1
60,14,"In column (3) we combine culture and economic freedom in the regressions to start disentangling the substitutability versus complementarity between economic freedom and culture. When controlling for economic freedom, culture is insignificant in the OLS regression but is significant at the 10% level in the fixed effects regression. Economic freedom retains its positive and highly significant (at the 99% level) relationship with growth in both specifications. For example, column (3) for the fixed effects model shows that a one standard deviation increase in culture and freedom increases growth by 0.65 percentage points and 1.93 percentage points, respectively. Also, in the fixed effects model, the joint significance of the F -statistics from columns (1), (2), and (3) are 8.74, 53.78, and 10.09, respectively, and are significant at the 99% level. This suggests that we explain more of the variation in growth when controlling for both culture and freedom than when controlling for culture alone. These results suggest that economic freedom is a strong contributor to economic performance, while culture displays a positive but milder effect on growth, lending support to the substitution hypothesis.",1
60,15,"In all five regression specifications, culture is insignificant, while economic freedom is positive and significant at the 99% level, lending further support for the substitution theory. Regression (1) suggests that a one unit increase in the freedom index increases growth by 1.40 percentage points. To gain a different perspective, if a country improves from the lowest score on the freedom index to the highest, it would experience an increase in growth by almost 10 percentage points, tripling the sample average. Freedom＊s coefficient is similar in all five regressions except when controlling for educational attainment. Once education is included in the regression, the coefficient on freedom almost doubles, and the R-squareds go from an average of 0.28 to 0.93, suggesting that this specification suffers from severe endogeneity. As expected, education has a strong positive and significant relationship with growth. Also, all other variables, except for culture, are significant in this specification. This is the only regression where investment, population growth, and area are significant.14 Urban population is significant in three out of four regressions, although it switches signs. Geography and legal origin are insignificant.",1
60,16,"Although the additional control variables do not add much explanatory power to the model, as suggested by the similar R-squareds from the baseline specification (except when education is included), we do acknowledge that our model is only explaining approximately 25% of the variation in growth. We believe this is due to our cautious approach with our control variables.",1
60,17,"Overall, we view our benchmark and core analysis as providing evidence that culture and economic freedom may actually behave as substitutes. The results suggest that economic institutions supporting private property rights, rule of law, and enforcement of contracts are a strong determinant of economic growth. This result holds in both models and across a variety of regression specifications. Our results show a mild, positive, and significant direct relationship between culture and economic growth; however, when controlling for economic freedom, culture is significant only in one out of seven regressions, a result consistent with the substitution hypothesis. We view this as suggesting that culture＊s connection with economic growth may be more complicated than previously suggested (for example, see Tabellini 2008a).",1
60,18,"In order to provide a more ＆direct＊ test for reverse causality, we provide a simple check where we utilize both lagged and future values of changes in freedom, changes in culture, and our growth rate. If reverse causality is driving our results, we expect that changes in income, i.e., the growth rate, will subsequently change freedom and, culture, or both; however, if freedom or culture is causing growth, then we expect changes in these variables to be associated with growth in the following period. Therefore, we analyze changes in these variables, as opposed to levels, for this specification only.",1
61,1,"To social workers, extreme economic inequality is primarily a violation of social justice, but this article shows how growing economic inequality since the mid-1970s was not only unjust, but also dysfunctional to the U.S. economy and linked to the recent economic crisis with its devastating effects, particularly on the social work clientele. The article identifies interrelated changes in ideology, the market economy, and government policies since the mid-1970s; contrasts the political economy of this period with the preceding post每World War II decades when the trend was toward a ※shared prosperity§; and shows how increased economic inequality and political consequences that undermined democracy itself contributed to the economic meltdown. The analysis has implications for the direction of social reform and for broadening the constituency of social movements in pursuit of the social work mission of social justice. How social workers can contribute to such movements and to a reduction of economic and political inequality is explored.",1
61,2,"From the perspective of economic inequality, the 65 years since World War II can be divided into two periods: (1) the first three decades when inequality, though ever present, was diminishing and (2) the subsequent 30 years when its rise culminated in economic crisis. The article begins by contrasting the two periods with respect to the distribution of income and wealth, wages, unemployment, and poverty. It then describes the political economy of the first period or the relationship between the democratic system of government and the capitalist economy. Although inequality remained a fact of American life in the first period, it was during this time that according to the British economist Andrew Shonfield (1965),a※new capitalism§ emerged, one in which the advance in national income benefitedpeopleunabletogaina share of prosperity through their earnings. Shonfield also called attention to ※the conscious pursuit of full employment§ (p. 63), a policy that enabled more people to earn higher incomes. In retrospect, this era may have been an anomaly in the history of capitalism, owing, in the case of the United States, to the federal government＊s more active role in the economy in response to the highly unusual conditions that preceded it: the Great Depression and World War II. ",1
61,3,"Escalating economic inequality in the past 30 years comes as no surprise. Yet even those who are cognizant of the economic divide can be shocked by how wide it has become. We encounter egregious inequality wherever we look〞at wages, income, wealth, poverty, and unemployment.",1
61,4,"Particularly egregious are the enormous and disproportionate income gains of the top 1 percent of households. According to a report of the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) (2010), the average after-tax income of these richest Americans in 2007〞just prior to the financial collapse〞was $1,319,700. This was an increase of $976,120 over the 1979 average, compared with increases of only $11,200 and $2,400 for the middle and bottom quintiles, respectively (in 2007 constant dollars). Analyzing these data from the CBO, Sherman and Stone (2010) of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities pointed out that the gaps in after-tax income between the richest 1 percent and the middle and poorest fifth of the country more than tripled between 1979 and 2007. Sherman and Stone concluded that the new data, along with prior research, ※suggest greater income concentration at the top of the income scale than at any time since 1928§ (p. 2)the eve of our prior, disastrous financial crash.",1
61,5,"Wealth is even more top heavy than income, and it has become increasingly concentrated in recent years. In one short interval〞1995 to 2004 〞when aggregate household net wealth nearly doubled, almost all the net gains went to the top quartile of the income distribution (Di, 2007). By 2004, the richest one-tenth owned 71 percent of private wealth (Wolff, 2007). Top Heavy is the apt title of a study of the increasing inequality of wealth in this country by Edward Wolff (1995),a leading scholar of the subject.",1
61,6,"During the period of shared prosperity, unemployment, though not low, was less than it was in ensuing decades, averaging 4.8 percent from 1949 to 1973, compared with 6.5 percent from 1974 to 2008 (Council of Economic Advisors, 1962, 2010). Unemployment not only spells lost income for workers and increasing inequality; it also means loss of potential output to the economy (Ginsburg, 1995). Moreover, years of relatively high unemployment have contributed to stagnating wages. (When unemployment is high and there are many more jobseekers than available jobs, employers can hire the workers they need without raising wages or providing attractive benefits and working conditions.) The converse is true when the labor market tightens. When unemployment dipped slightly below 4 percent in the 1990s〞hardly full employment, particularly for minority men〞wages and benefits rose, especially for low-wage workers, and this occurred despite counter-pressures from globalization (Bernstein & Baker, 2003; Pollin, 2007). Unemployment, of course, reduces incomes and tax revenues and increases government outlays to benefit jobless workers, thus contributing to budget deficits.",1
61,7,"To meet the severe challenges of the Great Depression and World War II, the federal government exerted more control over the economy. As a result, the American people became accustomed to a government that was larger and more active than it was prior to the Depression. Government spending and taxing policies reduced the severity of recessions and mildly redistributed income. Social welfare measures enacted in the 1930s, particularly unemployment compensation, served as economic stabilizers, expanding during recessions and thereby reducing the contraction of consumer spending that would otherwise have worsened a downturn. New Deal regulatory policies, meant to reduce the disastrous financial speculation that led to the stock market crash of 1929, were maintained in the first postwar era. The progressive, higher tax rates of World War II were continued in peacetime, and rising real wages were the quid pro quo for relative labor peace. ※Say what you want about the violations of free-market economics§ ( p. 64), wrote progressive economist Robert Kuttner (2007), ※a system that produced nearly three decades of egalitarian economic growth at an average annual growth rate of 3.8% cannot be all bad§ ( p. 64). ",1
61,8,"In an effort to reduce its competitive disadvantage, business could have stepped up investment to increase productivity and innovation. Instead, most businesses adopted alternative strategies that increased inequality (Harrison & Bluestone, 1985). In response to the profit squeeze, business squeezed labor〞through wage freezes and new work arrangements that increased the flexibility with which workers could be hired, fired, and scheduled. Globalization〞transfer of capital and business operations to lower-wage areas of the world〞was another strategy that followed rather than preceded the U-turn, and it was encouraged both by federal tax policies that give more favorable treatment to income earned abroad than stateside and government financing of overseas manufacturing plants. Still another strategy was to abandon production for paper profits, again resulting in manufacturing job losses. For example, General Electric sold off its consumer appliance manufacturing division and concentrated on its more profitable credit corporation (Phillips, 2002). Similarly, General Motors emphasized financial services over auto production (Wolff, 2009). Still another strategy was to lobby government to reduce taxes and regulations.",1
61,9,"In 1980, Republicans succeeded in uniting the interests of their fiscally conservative, pro-business base with a portion of the Democrats＊ New Deal coalition. As Edsall (1991) observed, such issues as affirmative action, the welfare expansion, school busing, women＊s liberation, gay rights, abortion, and perceived high taxes had become offensive to numerous, former Democratic voters (1991). Many white people, including blue-collar workers, defected from the party they associated with these policies, particularly because it was no longer seen as the purveyor of prosperity.",1
61,10,"Democrat Bill Clinton, despite a progressive, populist persona, presided over the repeal of AFDC and the quintessential New Deal banking regulation, the Banking Act of 1933 (or the GlassSteagall Act) (P.L. 73每66). Repeal meant that commercial and investment banks were no longer separated and that the high-risk culture of the latter that traditionally managed rich people＊s money would prevail. Globalization policies that largely ignored workers＊ rights and environmental protection were also carried on by Clinton, virtually without change from his Republican predecessor George Walker Bush.",1
61,11,"The influence of the financial sector was exemplified by President-elect Bill Clinton＊s abandonment of the populism of his presidential campaign. Candidate Clinton promised an economy that ※put people first.§ However, even before taking office, Clinton recognized that rich people were ※running the economy§ and that ※we help the bond market [by lowering deficits] and we hurt the people who voted us in§ (Woodward, as cited in Pollin, 2003, p. 91). Robert Rubin, co-senior partner of Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs, head of Clinton＊s National Economic Council and later his treasury secretary, was only one of several advisors urging the president-elect to focus on deficit reduction (Rubin & Weisberg, 2003).",1
61,12,"In explaining the meltdown, economist Arthur MacEwan (2009) emphasized the ※nexus of factors§ that have been identified in this discussion: ※growing concentration of political and social power in the hands of the wealthy; the ascendance of a perverse leave-it-to-the-market ideology which was an instrument of that power and rising inequality, which both resulted from and enhanced that power§ ( p. 23). This perspective takes into account both the commanding heights of the economy and its lower reaches. Arising from this ※nexus of factors§ are developments proximate to the meltdown that will be discussed in detail later〞the expanding role of credit, increased deregulation, and the housing bubble.",1
61,13,"Contributing to that limitation in the United States was increasing ※media monopoly.§ Between 1983 and 2004, the number of corporations controlling most of the newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations, book publishers, and movie companies shrank from 50 to five (Bagdikian, 2004). The media watchdog, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) held that ※mergers in the news industry have accelerated, further limiting the spectrum of viewpoints that have access to mass media§ (FAIR, n.d.). The viewpoint of the media was largely that of their owners.",1
61,14,"The contrasting perspective〞on agency and choice〞is consistent with the view that the political economies of capitalist countries are not homogeneous. Others, for example, are less wary of ※big government.§ Cross-national study shows that wealthy capitalist countries differ substantially with respect to poverty prevention and the size and scope of their welfare states (EspingAndersen, 1999; Goldberg, 2002, 2010). Despite retrenchment in nearly all welfare states in recent years, the relative poverty rates ( percentage of the population with less than 50 percent of median income) in 2000 were 7.3 percent and 8.4 percent in France and Germany, respectively, compared with over twice these rates, or 17.0 percent, in the United States. Canada and the United Kingdom, though often compared to the United States in welfare state typologies (Esping-Andersen, 1999), had considerably lower poverty rates (12.4 percent and 13.7 percent, respectively). Lower rates, ranging from 5.4 percent to 6.6 percent, were found in the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden (Luxembourg Income Study, n.d.).",1
61,15,"Intended to minimize the risk of these subprime mortgages were the complex financial instruments known as derivatives. According to the editors of the New York Times, derivatives were ※at the heart of the bubble, the bust, the bailouts.§ (※Congress passes financial reform,§ 2010, p. A26; see also Stiglitz, 2009). Credit-default swaps, a form of derivatives, are packages of mortgage loans for which banks that bought subprime mortgages sought insurance. Because insurance was regulated, the sellers of insurance on these loans called them ※credit default swaps§ to escape regulation. In 1998, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposed regulating these derivatives but was roundly opposed by Bill Clinton＊s Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, his deputy Lawrence Summers (later head of the National Economic Council), and Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan (Johnson & Kwak, 2010; Kuttner, 2007; Stiglitz, 2009).",1
61,16,"The prescription for recovery and reform can be inferred from this analysis. Reregulation of the financial sector; measures to reduce control of politics by economic elites; and a stronger, more progressive labor movement are needed if we are to reduce the fundamental problem of economic inequality. Policies to reduce inequality include the following: increases in social welfare, both the range of needs covered and the level of benefits, and the assurance of living-wage jobs for all who want to work. With increased income; broader and more adequate coverage of health care, housing, and child care; and availability and affordability of public transportation, lower- and middle-income consumers could meet their needs without feeling obliged to borrow beyond their capacities.",1
61,17,"Such job creation resembles the New Deal work programs planned and administered by social workers Harry Hopkins and Aubrey Williams. Path breaking though they were, these work programs did not employ women and minorities in proportion to their need (Rose, 2010) We can improve on the New Deal model by emphasizing jobs in the social〞child and elder care, education, health care〞along with the physical infrastructure. A new industrial policy to revive U.S. manufacturing would create jobs, increase opportunities for productive investment outlets, and decrease dependence on the financial sector (Pollin & Baker, 2009). These changes would require a substantial involvement of the federal government.",1
61,18,"Is the ideology of the free or unregulated market and hands-off government in decline? The money changers, despite failures that nearly imploded the world economy, remain in the temple. In the view of some knowledgeable observers, the power of Wall Street has increased (Johnson & Kwak, 2010). So far, it has fared better than Main Street. The stock market recovered, but unemployment hit the double-digit mark in October 2009 and continued to hover near 10 percent for months. Financial interests are opposed to reregulation. By late 2009, lobbyists representing banks and other business interests working on financial regulation outnumbered consumer advocates 25 to one (Johnson & Kwak, 2010), and financial interests spent nearly $600 million to weaken regulatory reform (※Congress passes financial reform,§ 2010). Yet Congress enacted the first regulatory legislation in a generation in July 2010. Although the legislation may not go far enough to limit the speculative practices that preceded the meltdown, it has a powerful consumer protection component. The real question is how effectively the new law will be implemented. Financial interests are preparing a ※lobbying blitz§ hoping to succeed in implementation where they fell short in blocking enactment (Lichtblau, 2010). ",1
61,19,"Although some social workers were in the forefront of government job creation in the 1930s, the profession thereafter has been more concerned with welfare than with work. Unemployment, even at half the current rate, leaves millions jobless or marginally employed, not to mention the social and economic effects of loss of income and a valued social role. Social workers could contribute to the reduction of inequality by participating in organizations that advocate direct job creation by government. Successful living-wage campaigns and efforts to raise the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit would decrease inequality. A stronger labor movement would also contribute to this goal and be a powerful voice for the working class. A way to do this is to support the Employee Free Choice Act of 2009 (H.R. 1409) that would make it easier for workers to join unions and reduce firing and harassment of those who take part in union organizing. Another would be for more social workers to join unions and, as members, to advocate for labor＊s commitment to reforms benefiting workers generally, not just union members.",1
61,20,"The high cost of meeting basic family needs shows that numerous families above the median income, including many social workers, are hardpressed and vulnerable to predatory lending. Who was protecting families against these predators? In earlier days, some settlements would have taken on that role, and they advocated as well for consumer protection and regulatory measures. In addition to consumer education, social workers should press for implementation of recently enacted consumer protection laws.",1
62,1,"Having joined the Eurozone in 2001, Greece experienced a short period of economic euphoria before confronting a major financial crisis some nine years later. In the period between joining the Eurozone and accepting the joint IMF/EU bailout package, the economic situation facing Greek voters changed dramatically. I use this setting to test the economic voting hypothesis. Using longitudinal aggregate data from 1981 to 2009, I investigate the relationship between macroeconomic indicators and vote share of the incumbent party to test the ※grievance asymmetry§ hypothesis. Moreover, by using individual-level data from 2004 to 2009, I investigate the extent to which retrospective sociotropic evaluations about the state of the economy are associated with support for the incumbent party. The results suggest that sociotropic economic evaluations are associated with government party support, but in a period when the economy is at its worst the incumbent has no real chance of winning and should expect support only from its longtime loyal supporters.",1
62,2,"2009 inaugurated the most difficult period for the Greek economy in recent times. For the past two years, the economic problems facing Greece have been making frontpage news around the world. For many who were impressed by the country＊s achievements over the past decade this was an unexpected development (Kalaitzidis, 2010). Greece after all was among the first group of countries accepted into the Eurozone. By 2004 economic activity was booming in anticipation of the Olympic Games, while unemployment was falling (Kasimati and Dawson, 2009). In the March 2004 election, the conservative ND (New Democracy) party had won a decisive victory, ending eleven years of rule by the Panhellenic Socialist Move (PASOK) (Panagopoulos and Marantzidis, 2006). PASOK＊s historical defeat at the 2004 election was at to increasing signs of corruption in the government. The conservative opposition leader, Kostas Karamanlis presented himself as a modest politician who would fight corruption and proceed with the necessary reforms (Dinas, 2010).",1
62,3,"By 2009, however, Greece＊s debt and budget deficit had risen to alarming levels. On September 2, 2009, Prime Minister Karamanlis announced a snap election. This decision was due to the difficulties facing the New Democracy (ND) government regarding reforms that would help handle the effects of the global recession, but also due to a series of scandals that led to the resignation of three ND ministers within less than a year (Gemenis, 2010). During the electoral campaign, Karamanlis presented ND as the only party refraining from making promises regarding the economic policy it would follow after the elections. Furthermore, he claimed credit for being sincere about the actual economic situation of the country, which he portrayed as a product of the global financial crisis (Dinas, 2010). Despite Karamanlis＊ efforts, PASOK won the election with a comfortable majority (43.9% of votes and 160 of 300 Parliamentary seats), on the premise that the economy was not doing well because of the poor management by the conservative government.",1
62,4,"In its simplest form, the idea behind economic voting is that voters are not ※fools§ but make rational judgments about what happened to the economy in the past (Key, 1966). Although prospective evaluations can also be relevant, foreseeing is not as easy as reminiscing. ※Voters, or at least a large number of them§,Key(1966, 150) argued, ※are moved by their perceptions and appraisals of policy and performance§. Building on Key (1966) andDowns (1957) , Fiorina (1981) further substantiated the point about retrospective evaluations by arguing that even uninformed voters ※have one comparatively hard bit of data: they know what life has been like during the incumbent＊s administration.§ Based on such evaluations, the voter can hold the government accountable and ※toss the rascals out§. Hence, it is relatively straightforward to reward and re-elect the government or to punish it and vote for the opposition.",1
62,5,"Due to the lack of systematic analyses of economic voting on Greece, the scarce knowledge we have in this respect is based on the comparative study by Freire and Costa Lobo (2005) and on a case study analysis by. Freire and Costa Lobo (2005) examined the effect of objective indicators and subjective individual perceptions of the economy on voting behavior in Greece, Portugal and Spain between 1984 and 1999 and found that in Greece there is a correlation between the perceptions of personal finances and the annual changes in the GDP. Using Eurobarometer data, the authors tested for the importance of the economy on the vote between 1985 and 2000 and found that the most important single factor determining party choice was ideology. However, the argument about the importance of economic evaluations and their relationship to party choice has not yet been tested empirically for recent elections. Before turning to individual-level data, however, I first examine economic voting at the aggregate level.",1
62,6,"The main argument which links macroeconomic performance to support for the incumbent party is the reward-punishment hypothesis. From this perspective, voters evaluate governments＊ performance on major economic indicators, such as inflation or unemployment. Then they reward or punish the incumbent based on its performance on keeping these macroeconomic indicators at the desirable levels (Sanders, 2000). In other words the government is accountable over the economic policymaking. In addition, political parties at the opposition can hope for voters＊ support when the performance of the party in government is considered inadequate (Lewis-Beck, 1988; Powell and Whitten, 1993).",1
62,7,"Studies on German and British data support Mueller＊s hypotheses that the electorate responds to economic conditions only when the latter deteriorate sharply (see Nannestad and Paldam, 1997, 85). Does the same holds for the individual-level analysis? Attempts to verify the ※grievance hypothesis§ at the individual level have not been successful (Kiewiet, 1983;Lewis-Beck, 1988 ) with the exception of the Danish electorate (Nannestad and Paldam, 1997). Conversely, van der Brug et al. (2007) have found support for the ※grievance asymmetry§ hypothesis in their cross-national assessment of economic voting. These positive findings may be related to the fact that the authors took a more permissive view on what constitutes an asymmetry. Instead of expecting the coefficients on improving economic conditions to be near zero (LewisBeck, 1988, 78), they reported some substantial differences in the magnitude of the impact between improving and deteriorating economic conditions (van der Brug et al., 2007,142每159).",1
62,8,"Previous individual-level simulations on the electoral consequences of changing economic conditions (van der Brug et al., 2007,142每159) suggested that in Greece, voters responded to the improvements of the economy by rewarding the governing party in terms of vote intentions and that the rewards were slightly stronger than the punishments. The lack of coalition governments, makes it a high-clarity country as it is very easy for voters to identify the party accountable for government policies. The Greek party system has been characterized by stable single-party governments, largely due to the disproportional electoral system (called ※reinforced proportional representation§ in Greek political parlance) which has been amended several times since the restoration of democracy in 1974. With the exception of the quasicaretaker coalition governments of 1989每1990 (Verney, 1990), ND and PASOK have been alternating in government, while all other parties remained in opposition.",1
62,9,"The scatterplots in Fig. 1 (bandwidth ? 0.7) show a rather mixed picture but there is some evidence suggesting that there is an asymmetry between fluctuations at the state of the economy and vote share for the governing party. When we examine each macroeconomic indicator separately we see that decreases in the GDP are associated with decreases in the vote for the incumbent party and vice versa but there is evidence for a threshold at 2.5% change. After this point it seems that incumbents are not rewarded for improving the indicator for growth. Turning to inflation it seems that increases in the rate of inflation up to about 17% are not associated with decreases in the vote for the incumbent. To the contrary, it seems that the voters are slightly rewarding the party. After this threshold, however, there is a steep decrease in the vote for the incumbent, although the number of observations after this threshold is very small to make definite judgments. Finally, changes in the unemployment rate between 1% and 1% are not associated with changes in the vote for the governing party as evident by the near flat curve. Similarly, to inflation, we observe a steep trend after the threshold indicating a punishment for the incumbents although the number of observations is very small.",1
62,10,"Since I am interested on the impact of the economic variables on the support for the incumbent party I perform a logistic regression analysis where the dependent variable is coded 1 if the respondent intends to vote for the incumbent and 0 for the intention to vote for any other party at the opposition (Lewis-Beck and Nadeau, 2000; Evans and Andersen, 2006). The logistic regression models allow us to estimate the probability that the voter will select the incumbent versus other parties and to examine how this distribution of probabilities changes when perceptions of the economy change. Yet as in most studies, vote choice is considered a function of temporary effects as the economic evaluations, long-term effects as party identification and ideology and demographics such as age and gender (Clarke et al., 2004).",1
62,11,"Fig. 2 suggests that comparing the 2004 to the 2009 election (the latter taking place a few months before Greece agreed to a bailout package with the IMF/EU), the percentage of voters who negatively evaluated the economy increased by almost 20 percent. In 2004, five years before the economic crisis, the percentage of those who evaluated the economy as a lot worse was 24.4% while in 2009 it increased to 43.9%. Nevertheless, if economic considerations are to play an important role in voters＊ minds, the economy has to be a salient issue for them (Whiteley et al., 2005). In both surveys, issue salience was measured by an open-ended questions asking responders to name the most important problem facing the country. Respondents were asked to mention up to two issues in 2004 and three in 2009. In both elections, economic issues were by far the most important in voters＊ minds. For both elections the Greek public mentioned the economy in general and inflation and unemployment in particular as the most important problems facing the country, far ahead of issues such as health, immigration, education or the environment. As we move from 2004 to 2009 two important changes occurred: the importance of the economy as the most important problem is raised by almost 20%, followed by a decline on the importance of unemployment as an issue.",1
62,12,"Table 1 displays the empirical results. As hypothesized, the coefficients for the economic variable turn out to be statistically significant and in the expected direction. In the 2004 national election, voters on the left side of the ideological spectrum were more likely to support the socialist governing party, PASOK. This also holds for voters who believed that the economic situation had been positive the year before the national election as well as those who identified with the incumbent. Furthermore, none of the sociodemographic variables are statistically significant. Moving to the 2009 estimates the pattern is repeated. Voters who positively evaluated the economy were more likely to vote for the incumbent. Since the incumbent at the 2009 national elections was the conservative ND, those who placed themselves at the right side of the ideological spectrum also tended to vote for ND. The analysis so far suggests that economic evaluations by the Greek electorate are associated with support for the incumbent party. Even though in 2004 the macroeconomic measures indicated that the economy was performing quite well, and one may assume that the salience of the economy as an issue during the electoral campaign would be of less importance, retrospective evaluations about the economy exhibit a substantive association with support for the incumbent party.",1
62,13,"Unfortunately, it is difficult to address this endogeneity in a regression model based on cross-sectional data as we lack suitable exogenous instruments. Instead, I offer a counterfactual argument. If we think of endogeneity in terms of an omitted variable problem (Clarke, 2009,5758), we would need to think how big the effect of this omitted variable would have to be in order to invalidate the findings presented in Table 1. With the most powerful predictors included in the model (party identification and left每right self-placement) it is hard to think of an additional explanatory variable which could predict vote for the incumbent party with an odds ratio of at least 1.8.3 Therefore it seems safe to conclude that although we might be overestimating the impact of economic evaluations on support for the incumbent, such an effect probably exists.",1
62,14,"In this article I set out to examine the relationship between the economy and voting behavior in Greece for the 2004 and 2009 election years. More specifically, I examined the implications regarding support for incumbent parties. The aggregate level analysis focusing on the relation between macroeconomic indicators and support for the incumbent party showed the existence of thresholds which provided some evidence for the ※grievance asymmetry§ theory. As in other countries, the Greek electorate seems to be punishing the party in government when economic conditions deteriorate rather than rewarding it when economic conditions improve. Nevertheless, the non-parametric techniques used to study the relationship do not allow for making inferences and drawing definite conclusions. A multilevel analysis of economic voting which included Greece showed that, when individual-level covariates are taken into account, rewards become as likely as punishments in the Greek context (van der Brug et al., 2007, 166). Despite the existing scarcity of Greek electoral data, future studies need to explore the question of ※grievance asymmetry§.",1
62,15,"Figs. 4 and 5 show that as we move from negative to positive evaluations about the economy the probability to vote for the incumbent party increases. Nevertheless, the confidence intervals between the adjacent plots for different levels of evaluation about the economy are overlapping. This means that if the mean evaluations among the electorate would change one level upwards or downwards we do not observe any substantive differences in the probability to vote for the incumbent party. Substantial changes (indicated by non-overlapping confidence intervals) are only observed in 2004 when we move from ※much worse§ to ※much better§ evaluations. Moreover, the figures hint that the position of the party on the Left每Right scale might make a difference for how much gain is to be expected from positive evaluations about the economy. The centrist position of PASOK (indicated by the vertical line) enables it to make gains across the ideological spectrum whereas for right-wing ND the gains on the left are associated with much uncertainty. At this point, however, It comes from expert surveys: for the 2004 election, the 2003 Benoit and Laver (2006) expert survey and for the 2009 election the Vowles and Xezonakis (2009) expert survey (Vowles et al., 2010). ",1
62,16,"Do these results imply that there was no economic voting in 2009? On the contrary, the results in Table 1 confirm that economic evaluations played an important role in both elections but when we take the evidence in Figs. 4 and 5 into account, we can conclude that this ※important role§ could not have a substantial impact in terms of electoral returns for the party in government. The latter finding is particularly true for 2009. The high odds ratio (about 23.7) for party identification in Table 1 indicates that, in June 2009, only the most loyal supporters of the conservatives intended to vote for the incumbent ND. This was confirmed about four months later at the parliamentary election of October 2009 where ND had the worst electoral result in its 35-year history (Gemenis, 2010, 358).",1
63,1,"The economic voting literature shows that good economic performance bolsters the electoral prospects of incumbents. However, disagreement persists as to whether voters in vulnerable economic conditions are more likely to engage in economic voting. It is argued in this article that a crucial factor in explaining individual-level variation in economic voting is the degree of exposure to economic risks, because risk exposure affects the saliency of the economy in voting decisions. In particular, the focus is on job insecurity and employability as key determinants of economic voting patterns. The article hypothesises that the extent of economic voting is greater in voters who are more vulnerable to unemployment and less employable in case of job loss. Support for these hypotheses is found in a test with a dataset that combines survey data on incumbent support with occupational unemployment rates and other measures of exposure to economic risks.",1
63,2,"A vast literature in political science explores the nexus between economic factors and electoral outcomes. Despite the persistence of various areas of contention in the economic voting literature (Lewis-Beck & Paldam 2000), the idea of the decisiveness of macroeconomic performance in democratic elections has consolidated to the extent that it is now widely accepted among the non-specialist public and the popular press. In recent years, however, this body of knowledge has been challenged on two main empirical and theoretical dimensions (Anderson 2007). On the one hand, several studies have highlighted the existence of considerable individual constraints to economic voting as individuals differ greatly in their ability and willingness to acquire information about the economy (Gomez & Wilson 2006). On the other hand, the institutional environment in which political behaviour takes place can affect economic voting decisively, because political institutions may shape the extent to which voters hold incumbents responsible for economic performance (Duch & Stevenson 2008).",1
63,3,"This article contributes to recent efforts in the economic voting literature to identify individual-level differences in voting behaviour (Duch et al. 2000; Hellwig 2001; Dorussen & Taylor 2002; Gomez & Wilson 2006; Kayser & Wlezien 2011; Singer 2013) in two main ways. First, it draws on the theoretical insights of a well-known but separate literature in political science to investigate the factors that mediate the relationship between macroeconomic performance and incumbent support. Although several studies have ascertained the importance of ＆skills＊ and professional job insecurity as a source of social policy preferences and welfare state arrangements (Iversen & Soskice 2001; Estevez-Abe et al. 2001; Rehm 2009, 2011a), the significance of such factors for economic voting is still largely unexplored.2 This article integrates these two threads of research by showing that macroeconomic performance is more decisive among individuals with more specific professional skills and among those employed in professions more vulnerable to unemployment. Second, this article offers new empirical evidence suggesting that voters respond to variations in macroeconomic performance according to their position in the labour market.",1
63,4,"The remainder of the article proceeds as follows. In the next section, I review the recent literature on economic voting, with particular emphasis on the study of individual-level variation in exposure to economic risk. I then outline a model of economic voting, showing the specific role that the degree of exposure to the economic cycle plays in shaping voting behaviour. Following this, I present the data used in this study and the strategies I follow for the empirical test. Finally, I discuss the results of the regression analysis and conclude with some remarks on the main avenues for further research.",1
63,5,"Many studies of economic voting have been reluctant to study this question. Following seminal work by Stokes (1963), the economy has often been considered as a ＆valence issue＊, as all voters arguably prefer a good economy to a bad one. As Stokes himself observes, in debates over valence issues, ＆the argument turns on where the credit or blame ought to be assigned＊ or, in electoral competitions, on ＆which party, given possession of the government, is the more likely to bring it about＊ (Stokes 1963: 373). Since this paradigm has been preponderant in the economic voting literature, most scholars have focused on the process of responsibility attribution, assuming lack of variation in the salience of economic performance (see, e.g., Van der Brug et al. 2007; Wlezien 2005; McAvoy 2006). Yet some classic studies of economic voting have laid the theoretical foundations for conceptualising the role of individual economic conditions in shaping economic voting patterns. Hibbs (1977), in particular, famously showed that there are differences across groups within the electorate in responsiveness to signals of macroeconomic performance such as inflation and unemployment.",1
63,6,"This article offers two main contributions to this debate. First, it calls for close integration between work on economic voting and the literature on social policy preferences. It argues that an individual＊s position in the labour market is a pivotal factor not only in determining their preferences over social insurance, but also in shaping economic voting patterns. At the macro-level, such disparities in risk exposure result in significant differences in voting behaviour across occupational groups. Second, this article performs the first empirical test of this argument using data on occupational unemployment, which is a key concept in the debate on social policy preferences and the origins of the welfare state. Furthermore, it offers a range of alternative measures of the idea of ＆risk exposure＊ to test the robustness of its results to different operationalisation strategies.",1
63,7,"The findings from these seminal articles call for a closer integration between the economic voting literature and the insights of another well-known, although separate body of work in political science. Scholarly studies of the determinants of social policy preferences have presented ample evidence that there are deep inequalities in the distribution of economic risks across the electorate, and that such disparities are a source of variation both in preferences over redistribution (Iversen & Soskice 2001; Rehm 2009) and in macro-level welfare state arrangements (Estevez-Abe et al. 2001; Rehm 2011a). In particular, it is possible to identify two classes of individual-level factors that determine the exposure to the economic cycle of individual voters. According to one line of analysis, the specificity of professional skills developed through education and professionalisation practices is positively related to the degree of risk exposure because workers with non-transferable skills are more likely to suffer from protracted unemployment in case of job loss (Iversen & Soskice 2001). From another angle, risk exposure is a function of job insecurity rather than employability. On the one hand, industry affiliation shapes job security through various channels (Frieden & Rogowski 1996; Mayda & Rodrik 2005; Iversen & Cusack 2000). ",1
63,8,"These core tenets of the economic voting model suggest that there are two main reasons why voters may care about macroeconomic performance. On the one hand, the prosperity of the economy may be considered as a good in itself, and economic voting may follow a ＆sociotropic＊ pattern in which voters support incumbents only if they have furthered the material well-being of their country as a whole (Kinder & Kiewiet 1981). On the other hand, economic performance also matters because the future financial flows that individual voters receive depend, at least in part, from the health of the national economy. For the argument advanced here, it is crucial to assume that, at least to some extent, economic voting takes place due to ＆pocketbook＊ concerns about future repercussions of economic performance on an individual＊s personal finances. If voters did not care about how aggregate economic performance affects future developments in their own personal finances, exposure to economic risk would not be a relevant factor in economic voting. ",1
63,9,"To understand why this is the case, we need to consider a factor largely understudied in literature on economic voting 每 namely the salience of the economy and its variation across the electorate. In particular, two fundamental assumptions are made in this article about the relationship between salience of the economy and voting behaviour. First, it assumes substantial cognitive limits in the way voters receive and process information about specific political issues. Following foundational work by Herbert Simon on ＆bounded rationality＊ (Simon 1982), empirical research in behavioural economics and social psychology has shown that individuals, acting under various forms of constraints, tend to consider only a few items from their broader spectrum of preferences when taking decisions.8 In voting behaviour, this means that most voters do not evaluate candidates based on their performance in all policy areas, but only on their performance in some areas they consider of particular interest (Rabinowitz et al. 1982; Krosnick 1988; McGraw et al. 1990; Lavine et al. 1996; Belanger & Meguid 2008). This insight is important for economic voting because, although all voters may prefer a more competent economic manager to a bad one, some of them might care less about this attribute of the candidate than about others.",1
63,10,"Recent developments in the literature on economic voting have been instrumental in refining our understanding of the link between macroeconomic performance and voting behaviour. Most of the recently published studies acknowledge the importance of economic voting while qualifying its extent, showing substantial differences both across individuals and countries. In particular, many have focused on the idea of responsibility attribution and on individual-level characteristics that shape the cognitive processes involved in the economic voting model. I have observed in this article that there is another, equally important and understudied dimension in the process of economic voting. I have argued, in particular, that the study of economic voting should take into account the valuable insights provided by the scholarship on social policy preferences and welfare state development. Specifically, I have proposed in this article that voters be categorised in different groups according to their vulnerability to economic fluctuations, and hypothesised that economic voting occurs more extensively in voters who are more directly exposed to the economic cycle. The analysis performed in the previous section has found important empirical regularities consistent with this hypothesis: voters facing higher degrees of job insecurity and lower employability in case of job loss are more likely to condition their support for incumbent governments to good macroeconomic performance.",1
63,11,"The positive findings reported here, however, should be qualified by some limitations of the research design adopted for this study, and indeed such shortcomings offer potentially fruitful avenues for further research on the nexus between economic voting and economic risk. First, the argument outlined in this article should be tested with actual voting data as the response variable adopted here is a measure of public opinion rather than voting behaviour. To be sure, the analysis has been restricted to respondents who expressed the intention to vote, but discrepancies between such intentions and actual voting choices, including non-voting, are not controlled for in this study. Second, the sample is limited to a small group of advanced economies. The inclusion of a larger number of clusters in the sample could address potential methodological shortcomings in the estimations of standard errors for macro-level variables, and it could allow the exploration of interaction effects between cluster-level covariates. Furthermore, campaign-specific dynamics and political communication strategies, while not studied here, are important factors in determining the saliency of the economy in electoral contests. Finally, this article has not tested the causal mechanism postulated.",1
63,12,"Figure 3 offers a graphic representation of the difference between the two groups, plotting two distinct curves of predicted probabilities of incumbent support as a function of GDP growth. As the chart shows, the curve for low-skill respondents (solid curve) is substantially steeper than the high-skill curve (dashed curve) as incumbent support for low-skill respondents is more sensitive to macroeconomic fluctuations. For illustration purposes, consider the difference in predicted probabilities of incumbent support between a bad economic conjuncture (e.g., 每 1 per cent growth) and a very good one (e.g., 3 per cent growth). For low-skill respondents, the difference is sharp: poor economic performance decreases support for the incumbent by about 0.21, as it drops from 0.45 to 0.24. For the high-skill group, however, the difference is only about 0.08 (from 0.39 to 0.31). The chart also suggests that the divergence is more marked during economic crises than in times of economic booms 每 perhaps an indication that the two groups differ more in their willingness to punish incumbents for bad economic management than in their willingness to reward them for good performance.",1
63,13,"Models 3每5 estimate the model in Eqn 3 using alternative measures of job insecurity. Model 3 interacts macroeconomic growth with a dummy variable that measures whether the respondent is unemployed. As unemployed respondents are in particularly vulnerable economic conditions, we should expect the coefficient for the interaction term to be positive. The estimation reported in Table 2 shows that this is indeed the case, although the coefficient is not significant at the 0.05 level in either the simple logistic or the random effect model. The role of employment in the public sector as an indicator of job security is explored in model 4. The results reported show that the significance of public sector employment is very sensitive to model specification as it is barely significant in the random effect model (model 4r) and not significant in the simple regression model. Furthermore, contrary to expectations, the coefficient is positively signed and of modest magnitude. Therefore, there does not seem to be a discernible difference in economic voting patterns between respondents employed in the private sector and those employed in the public sector. Finally, estimations for models 5 and 5r offer empirical evidence that being a union member is an important factor in economic voting behaviour.",1
64,1,"The paper analyses transformation process in Hungary between 1989 and 2004. The goal of this paper is to analyze and evaluate the transformation process in Hungary. The structure of the paper follows this general goal. First of all, an analysis of economic development of the country before the fall of the communist regime is carried out because this determined the whole process which followed. Then we shortly mention political development that had a significant impact on the transformation process and its results. In the next part we concentrate on the main steps in the economic transformation, and consequently we devote space to specific aspects privatization, for example. The main economic indicators of this period are analyzed in the final part. We conclude that the transformation process achieved its main economic goal and the economy＊s ability to grow increased. At the same time, however, the transformation process created environment for the subsequent economic problems.",1
64,2,"The goal of this paper is to analyze and evaluate the transformation process in Hungary. In the author＊s opinion, the main goal of the transformation process was a shift in the paradigm of the economy from the centrally planned system to a form of a market economy. In our view, this goal was generally reached with the accession to the EU. This is why we limit our paper to the period ending with 2004. We consider it an indirect proof that the environment reached a well-functioning market economy (formally it is a condition of the accession). The interesting question is how this state was achieved. We should not take it for granted because we can see several transforming countries that are still quite far from the state of a well-functioning market economy (for example Belarus). A shift in the overall trend of the economic development was the second goal of the transformation process, a more specific one, in our view. The centrally planned economy was doomed to fail 每 economic growth was declining and in fact negligible in the 1980s. As a consequence, the Hungarian economy was lagging behind the market economies. Any change of the pattern of the economy without improving its growth ability would be worthless. The paper tries to evaluate the progress from this point of view.",1
64,3,"We will start by describing the long-run political development in Hungary, which had an impact on the state of the Hungarian economy at the end of the 1980s, which is analyzed in the second chapter. In the next step we will concentrate on the political development during the transformation era, for which we consider the period between 1990 and 2004 (the accession to the EU). We believe that the accession to the EU can be seen as a proof of the state of the Hungarian economy. The main economic development is analyzed in the 3 following chapters. We concentrate on the sequence of the reforms first of all. Then the privatization development is examined in a stand-alone block. These two chapters describe the main economic steps. Then, in the last chapter, we sum up economic results in the studied period. In specific subchapters, economic growth, structure of the economy, inflation, unemployment and external relationship are analyzed.",1
64,4,"We would like to point out that while working on the paper, we were confronted with troubles regarding data. Primarily, there were problems with length of consistent data series because it was highly difficult to find relevant and homogenous data that would cover the whole transformation period. As a consequence, we were forced to use shorter series. The data that we use are in our view the best that could be obtained.",1
64,5,"This text focuses on development during the transformation process but it is necessary to see Hungary in a broader prospect to understand it better. The long-run economic development has deep roots in our point of view. The key event was the consequence of the First World War. Hungary lost important part of its land to successor states of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and large Hungarian minorities found themselves in the neighboring countries 每 Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. It was deemed by Hungarians as totally unjust. The main goal of Hungarian diplomacy in the interwar period was unifying all Hungarians into a single state, or in other words to recreate large Hungary. The way to achieve this goal was in cooperation with fascist Germany in the 1930s 每 and Hungary became Germany＊s ally during the war.",1
64,6,"Political relaxing deepened during the time and led even to the forming of an opposition in the middle of the 1980s. Negotiations around the round table took place in 1989, resulting in a change of the constitution that guaranteed transition to democracy, market economy, human rights and explicit ban of a single party government (even in the situation when the party has majority in the parliament). This change was approved on October, 23, 1989, and it is considered to be the beginning of new democratic Hungary. This way, the country ※jumped§ directly into democracy with free elections in March 1990. Hungarians avoided any form of pseudo-democracy or government of national unity.",1
64,7,Political development had an immediate impact on the development of the Hungarian economy. The centrally planned system had been established in the country after the Second World War. There were of course differences to other centrally planned systems in the region but the basis of the system was similar. The Hungarian system was generally never as tough as in Czechoslovakia but even bigger differences started to appear as they introduced reforms after 1968.,1
64,8,"Hungary was the first country of Central Europe to have incorporated value added tax into the tax system, which occurred in 1988. Furthermore 63% of all prices were liberalized already in 1989.3 There were continuous devaluations of the forint 每 from 45.8 to USD in 1986 to 63.2 in 1990 (Vintrov芍, 1992).",1
64,9,"Bethkenhagen (1989) wrote that private sector had created 3% of national product in 1970. In 1989 it created already more than one quarter (Holman, 2000) and two thirds of Hungarians had an income from private activity in addition to their main jobs in a state company or a cooperative. These numbers are several times higher compared to Czechoslovakia ?s numbers but are of course far from any market economy.",1
64,10,"How the reforms and changes during the communist reign reflected in the economy? As we can see in the following figure, the overall trend in Hungary was similar to other countries of the Eastern Block after the Second World War, but the growth was affected by more significant fluctuations than in Czechoslovakia. The economy was able to achieve strong growth during the 1950s but this ability declined in the following decades to very low growth during the 1980s (the average was only 0.7% per a year Maddison, 2010). The general trend is clearly visible in the following figure. Economic reforms generally did not lead to improvement in the trend of economic growth. On the contrary, economic results were worsening.",1
64,11,"We have already mentioned that the first free elections took place in March/April of 1990. The first post-communist government was created by Jozsef Antall (1932-1993). The government was central-right and based on Christian and national parties. It had a strong majority of 60% in the parliament, which gave the government a stable position. One of its achievements was that Soviet troops left Hungary in the middle of 1991. In the same year, the association agreement with the European Community was signed as well.",1
64,12,The MSZP post-communist left wing party won the next elections in 1994 by landslide. Due to the economic situation they were forced to introduce tough economic measures (of which more later). A right wing coalition government (Fidesz was the main party) was created after the elections in 1998. Hungary joined NATO during its regime. Fidesz won the next elections in 2002 as well but was not able to assemble a government that was formed by left wing parties instead.,1
64,13,"Generally, the country adhered to democratic principles for the whole period and became a member of the European Union in 2004. But there has been a lasting dissatisfaction with the transformation process and life in general in Hungary. The results of one of the surveys (2006) are depicted in the following table.4 Personally, I do not have any reasonable explanation for this attitude. We can consider high expectations of the Hungarians at the end of the 1980s and a possibility that they were generally content with the semi-capitalist system of the goulash communism.",1
64,14,"The sequence of the reforms in Hungary was under similar discussion as in other countries at the beginning of the transformation period. Hungary was specific in the fact that its communist party had started reforms before the fall of the regime already. Hungarians therefore naturally believed that it was not necessary (or it was de facto impossible) to follow radical reforms. There was a general belief that slower reforms can bring the same results with lower costs. On the other hand, proponents of a shock therapy did not trust government ability to establish market economy. As a consequence, the first period of Hungarian transformation is often described as gradualist but there are always troubles with the definition of gradualism. Some of the Hungarian measures especially bankruptcy law 每 can be seen as extremely radical. The second subchapter deals with reforms which took place in the middle of the 1990s, and the last, third subchapter concentrates on the period after the turn of the century.",1
64,15,"We have already mentioned that Hungarian economy had suffered from macroeconomic imbalances. Laki (1993) wrote that the Antall government had had three main tasks 每 to keep creditworthiness of the country, reduce inflation and the growing public deficit. The last of these tasks was the most demanding one because after the communist regime had collapsed, problems with public finance worsened. With the fall of the regime the state income declined but the cabinet was not able to simultaneously decrease its expenditures. On the contrary, the government quite often took on responsibilities for late state companies that had provided social services to the public and it led to another increase in spending (Allen, Hass, 2001).",1
64,16,"However, Hungarian government proceeded with reforms of the business and the financial sectors at the same time. Steps were taken to improve the legal system, to privatize, to improve antitrust policy, and foremost in the field of bankruptcy. Hungarian gradualism is highly questionable if we take into account the bankruptcy legislation. A very tough new code was in effect from the beginning of 1992. If a company was not capable of paying its debts within 90 days, it had to call to start bankruptcy proceeding itself. The law was in force for 18 months, and 5,000 subjects went bankrupt (Holman, 2000). These subjects together had created 10% of Hungarian GDP (Nestor, Thomas, 1995). This bankruptcy proceeding was in fact a privatization method at the same time because around 500 large companies that had gone bankrupt were transferred into private ownership (Nestor, Thomas, 1995). The process had a negative impact on the banks that were affected by the growing number of classified credits. We should recall that in comparison to that, bankruptcy legislation was very weak in the Czech Republic 每 in the same period considered, the very first law was approved in 1993 only and it could not been applied against companies waiting to be privatized.",1
64,17,"The economic results in Hungary in this period were not positive. If the country represents a case of a gradual reform, then gradualism turned out incapable of avoiding transformation recession. Hungary suffered similar (or deeper) decline as other countries in Central Europe. Unemployment rate was relatively high. Inflation development did not embrace the typical jump after the price liberalization (that took place in other countries) but there was a continuously higher inflation rate. On the positive side, a relatively high level of foreign capital was flowing into the country. It had again its roots in the previous liberalization because foreign investors were familiar with situation in Hungary. At the same time, deficit of the current account appeared.",1
64,18,"The goal of these steps was obvious. The government wanted to reduce deficits of the public finance and the trade balance and increase competition in the economy. The consequences of the measures were harsh 每 government expenditure declined by 10% of GDP (Stojanov, 2004); real wages decreased by 12% in 1995 and 4% in 1996 (Holman, 2000), and economic growth slowed down to just 1% in both 1995 and 1996. At the same time, the main imbalances in the economy narrowed 每 the trade deficit declined between 1994 and 1996. The government deficit (without incomes from privatization) diminished from 8.4% to 3% in the same period as well (see the previous table). Overall development of public finance during the first decade can be seen in the following figure. We can see that average deficit was relatively high 每 between 1990 and 2004 5.5% of GDP (EBRD, 26. 11. 2007). These results were generally the worst from the CentralEuropean countries.",1
64,19,"The economic development after applying of the Bokros package is generally deemed to be positive. Unfortunately, this prosperous period lasted only for a few years. And Hungary had to face growing problems at the beginning of the new century. Foremost, Hungarian government created notorious problems in fiscal field, for which government expenditures were to blame. Gabrisch and H?lscher (2006), for example, state that wages in the public sector increased by 12-13% only in 2002. Growing deficit of the public finance can be seen in the previous chart. Trade was another source of instability because its deficit was getting larger. The trade deficit reached between 6-8% of GDP at the beginning of the new century, being partly caused by slowing down of European economies, but mostly by the decline of competitiveness that resulted from growth of wages.",1
64,20,"The central bank was worried about lasting inflation pressures and responded by a monetary restriction, widening the fluctuation band from ㊣2.25 to ㊣15 in May 2001 as well. In the summer, the system of inflation targeting was introduced, and the currency became fully convertible. That year in October, crawling peg was abandoned and central parity of the forint was fixed. Generally, the central bank shifted its emphasis from controlling exchange rate to inflation targeting, but the central parity and the fluctuation zone were still valid. It meant that the central bank tried to hit two targets (inflation and exchange rate) by a single tool 每 interest rates. This task was made even more complicated by free movement of capital. On the other hand, Hungarian authorities decided to fix the currency when inflation was declining and pressures on the nominal exchange rate were expected to be lower.",1
64,21,But the problem with higher inflation that we have mentioned previously caused a negative trend of growing indebtedness in foreign currencies that continued in the following years. This development was important especially for households that often obtained mortgages in Swiss francs or euros. The share and growth of this kind of debt can be seen in the following chart. This development was obviously caused mainly by higher inflation and the fact that interest rates in Hungary were consequently higher than in the developed countries. This dangerous borrowing trend was not creating problems only if the exchange rate was stable or appreciating.,1
64,22,We should notice that high government deficits mentioned above (see Figure 2) were not expressed in growing government debt (in our period) 每 see the following chart. But both of these negative trends 每 indebtedness in foreign currencies and growing government debt 每 caused serious problems to Hungarian economy in the second half of the 2000s.,1
64,23,"We have mentioned differences among the central European countries at the beginning of the transformation process. As far as ownership is concerned, the biggest difference was in the role of managers of state companies. In Hungary, their role was much more accepted than in Czechoslovakia, where they were deemed as foremost high-ranking communists. As a consequence, the managers were allowed to gain control over thousands of companies in Hungary already at the end of the 1980s. This process is sometimes called a spontaneous privatization.",1
64,24,"As we can see in the following survey, the attitude of the public towards privatization was definitely not unambiguous. The numbers say that restitutions (re-privatization) had low support in Hungary, and that there was relatively high resistance to privatization as such 每 one of the highest numbers in the whole Eastern Europe. At the same time, however, we can notice the highest support for selling companies for the highest price offered. Laki (1993) wrote that in a survey from middle of 1991, 34% of the respondents were against privatization as such, but as many as 55-60% were against privatization of their own company. At the same time, there was strong sentiment against foreign investment and return of the previous landowners.",1
64,25,"We have already mentioned the act from 1988 that allowed transformation of the state companies into joint-stock companies in Hungary. This was a turning point that enabled managements to take control over the companies. Insiders kept playing a dominant role in Hungarian privatization at the beginning of the following decade 每 Earle and Estrin (1996) write that the government was not able to keep full ownership or sell a company to outsiders without insiders consenting of it. The important role of management and their abusing of the power was accompanied by scandals and embezzlement. The public turned against this form of privatization, which resulted in a slowdown of the whole privatization process (Srholec, 2001).",1
64,26,"Institutional environment was developed and state Property Fund (SPA) was founded in 1990. This organization became a central agency responsible for privatization. In 1990, SPA controlled 1,975 state companies (1,700 in industry and the rest in agriculture). According to Earle and Estrin (1996) it probably prevented even worse abuse of the situation because the Property Fund had the right to approve of all sales.",1
64,27,"The government launched the process of small privatization in the meantime. The first program was called pre-privatization and started in May 1990. It was targeted at retail, and the goal was, among others to stop spontaneous privatization. Roughly 10,000 units were sold or leased between 1991 and 1993. This way of privatization involved mostly small shops and restaurants, which were mainly auctioned. An important factor was that employees of the respective shops gained majority of the property. Changes in property ownership can be seen in the following table.",1
64,28,"Until the mid 1995, SPA divested itself of 75% of the previous ownership, which nevertheless represented only 35% of state property (Stojanov, 2004). The government still kept possession in gas distribution, railways, airlines, telecommunication, banks and chemical companies. This changed with the Bokros package, though. The government urgently needed to decrease fiscal deficits, and intensification of the privatization process was one of the ways to achieve this. It was decided that all stateowned property with the exception of railways, post office and national parks would be sold. The rest of the property for sale included The Savings Bank (OTP) and the main telecommunication company, among others. The amount of property for privatization reached HUF 1.3 trillion out of 1.6 trillion of the overall state ownership (Stojanov, 2004). A typical method was a direct sale to a foreign investor, which resulted in a huge inflow of foreign direct investment in this period. A growing role of foreign ownership can be seen in the following table. Until the end of 1997, the government sold property worth HUF 790 billion and its debt decreased from 86% of GDP in 1995 to 60% in 1998 (Stojanov, 2004).",1
64,29,"Economic growth can be seen in the following figure. We can notice that similarly to other countries in central Europe, Hungary too suffered from transformation recession. The slower pace of the reforms (gradualism) did not help avoid the recession, and a visible slowdown after 1995 occurred here, too. But the general trend is positive. We should compare the results of HP filter during the communist regime with results after 1990. Hungarian economy was able to achieve growth around 3 or 4 percent after having overcome the transformation recession.",1
64,30,"Hungary was not spared growth in unemployment in the first years of transformation even though the country was actually following a more gradual approach. Within several years, unemployment achieved its maximum 每 around 12% of the labor force, after which it gradually declined. It is in contrast with the development in the Czech Republic, where unemployment rate was minimal until 1997 and grew only with the currency and economic crises in 1997. At that time, however, unemployment rate in Hungary had already been declining steadily. We should stress that in both of these countries, unemployment rate was very low in comparison to other post-communist countries 每 Poland being one of the examples, as we can see in the following figure. On the other hand, there was deep decline in employment in Hungary and thus the numbers are affected by it.",1
65,1,Current economic literacy tests focus on theory while almost totally ignoring the economy itself. This study analyzes how well we are teaching students empirical facts. Most agree that economic literacy is a laudable goal and current literacy pedagogy is centered on teaching students how to ※think like economists.§ The authors do not intend to imply criticism to current literacy campaigns; rather this work is intended to open a discussion within the field about the need to also introduce students to some basic economic facts. This study is based upon surveys given to several hundred introductory economics students and tabulates some preliminary observations about their level of fact attainment.,1
65,2,"Fact based, objective economics, allows the learner to understand some of the realities of the economy they live in. From that starting point the student can go on to make decisions about where they envision the economy is going and also make normative suppositions about how the economy should be directed. In doing this instructors must serve two differing roles: 1) to offer the students the differing models that explain how the economy works; and 2) to give the students the basic, factual information about economic variables so students can then use the models appropriately. Issue number one, which models should be taught, is beyond the scope of this work. This study wishes to emphasize the second role. By offering students factual information about real economic variables students are going to be able to make better informed decisions about economic issues.",1
65,3,"There has been some discussion on the appropriateness of this direction in defining literacy. In 2002, Hansen, Salemi, and Siegfried presented a paper on potential ways to reorder college principle classes to improve literacy attainment at that level. They argue that current intro classes, with the heavy emphasis on technical literacy, ill serve the majority of students who are taking the classes who will never take further economics training. Hansen, Salemi and Siegfried mention a study where on a 15 point survey, ※college economics course-takers scored 9, high-school economics course takers scored an 8, and those who took no economics scored a 7§ (2002, 463). Hansen, Salemi and Siegfried suggest in their paper that a reorganization of the introductory series be attempted. That extra time could then be used to ※focus on problems, issues, and puzzles§ and ※create more opportunities to practice economics§ (468).",1
65,4,"It seems fair to suggest that the individuals putting forth the goal of ※practicing economics§ are honest in their desire to improve student understanding, yet what does this statement mean? Does this mean teaching the students to think in terms of utility maximization? If so, then doesn＊t this suggest that utility maximization is not some natural state and instead, it must be learned? Does this simply mean introducing our students to the best models we currently have available and leave it at that? As stated in the opening paragraph, introducing the students to these models is of importance but simply introducing the models to the students without giving them a basic understanding of real economic variables has inevitable downfalls. Doing so would be the equivalent of helping students build a car but never telling them that in order for the car to run you must put gas into the tank. Given the rhetorical power of basic economic analysis it would seem reasonable that we have an obligation to give our students the facts from which these devices are derived and we have an obligation to teach the sound application of facts to whatever models we teach.",1
65,5,This current essay is part of an ongoing project being conducted by colleagues who are interested in exploring how well informed the U.S. population is with respect to actual economic variables. This project is based on the firm belief that more can be achieved by giving Americans factual information than can be achieved by simply giving people disembodied economic models with little grounding in empirics.,1
65,6,"The facts that are chosen for inclusion into the realm of ※economics§ are important since they will serve to define the scope of that which is considered part of the field. It is conceivable that it is for this reason that fact based economic instruction has become less emphasized. It is perhaps beyond question that most economists would agree that GDP, GDP/person, inflation, and unemployment are important macro topics. Other economists may take time to cover poverty, income distribution and the changing dynamics of these variables over time. Still others may emphasize the role of interest rates and banking. A few might cover issues such as how the tax system works or how social security works. Most economists are going to offer their students an emphasis that is directed by their personal interests. Yet in covering any of these topics do we offer the students real information about the actual empirical numbers that we are detailing? More importantly are we offering the students accurate information on the topics of great importance?",1
65,7,This working group wants to measure how well individuals in the economy understand actual economic variables. This is an ongoing project and as such our methods and procedures will be changing as we move forward. We surveyed 341 incoming introductory economics students on a battery of questions emphasizing variables we thought important. We now offer some preliminary findings we believe may be of interest to the discipline.,1
65,8,"To be fair, the members of this working group believe that the wording of the question may be such that some of the people may be misconstruing the concept of GDP with GDP/person. Efforts are being made to improve the survey mechanism. Yet even with the flawed question the current evidence suggests that numbers, such as GDP/person, can be taught and will be remembered. This is clearly demonstrated by the students who answered close to correct after taking the courses of the instructors who are part of this working group.",1
65,9,"In this survey we decided to look at the knowledge of the students with respect to income distributions in the United States. We asked the following questions on income distribution. What household income does it take to be in the top 20% and top 5% of income earning households in 2007? The actual numbers for 2007 were around $87,000 and $166,000 respectively. Figure 1 gives the breakdown of answers by percentage of student＊s answers in the specific range for 5% and Figure 2 gives the breakdown for 20%.",1
65,10,"The average responses given by the students as a whole were an income of $20,056,314 to be in the top 5% and $887,906 to be in the top 20%. Looking at the overall observations, 80% of the respondents overestimated the income it took to be in the top 5% and 70% of the respondents overestimated the income it took to be in the top 20%. If we look at the percentages that overestimated the amount by at least double, we have 56% that offered an answer at least double the actual number for the top 5% and 35% of respondents answered at least double the actual number for the top 20%. Given these observations it should probably not be surprising that politicians are able to claim that raising taxes on households with over $250,000 in income is giving a tax increase to middle income households. This study suggests that most of the students have a severe misperception of income distributions in the United States.",1
65,11,"We can once again breakdown the responses based upon the formal training of the respondents, and get some interesting results. It seems to be the case that the more formal training the more accurate the average response becomes with respect to the 20% answers. However, with respect to the 5% level it looks as if there is no difference between ※no high school§ and ※college§ (see Table 1). High school classes seem to have a negative impact on actual understanding given this study＊s data. (Please note that the instructors past students seem to have done remarkably better than the rest but their average responses are also far off from the real numbers.)",1
66,1,"In this paper, we investigate the systemic link between economic freedom, foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth in a panel of 85 countries. Our empirical results, based on the generalized method-ofmoment system estimator, reveal that FDI by itself has no direct (positive) effect on output growth. Instead, the effect of FDI is contingent on the level of economic freedom in the host countries. This means the countries promote greater freedom of economic activities gain significantly from the presence of multinational corporations (MNCs).",1
66,2,"The effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on growth has been debated extensively in the economic literature. The rising interest in this area of research also coincides with the shift in emphasis among policymakers towards attracting more FDI inflows in recent years. Since the early 1980s, many countries (including the developing ones) have lifted many of the restrictions imposed on foreign capital flows.1 As a result, global FDI inflows rose sharply from $57 billion in 1982 to $1271 billion in 2000. In fact, over the past few decades the growth rate of world FDIs has exceeded the growth rates of both world trade and GDP (UNCTAD, 2001). The reason for the increased effort to attract more FDIs stems from the widespread belief that FDI has several positive effects, including productivity gains, transfers of new technology, the introduction of new processes, management techniques, and technical know-how in the local market, employee training, and international production networks.2 Additionally, FDI is not as volatile as other forms of capital (e.g., short-terms capital), and hence, is less destructive (World Bank, 1999).",1
66,3,"In an effort to further understand the nature of the FDI每growth nexus, this paper draws from recent literature that highlighted the importance of institutions in the growth process. In particular, our research emphasizes the importance of freedom of economic activities in mediating FDI spillovers to help answer these questions. Our argument is simply based on the fact that the lack of economic freedom can limit a firm's (or nation's) ability to absorb and internalize new technology from multinational corporations (MNCs) (i.e., foreign presence) and contribute to host country's economic growth. To date, the literature has emphasized the quality of institutions and economic freedom, but the focus has been primarily on the direct effect on economic growth. Hence, this is not the first article that examines the role of economic freedom in wealth creation.",1
66,4,"In this paper, we utilize the index of economic freedom (EF, hereafter) provided by the Fraser Institute to establish the potential link between EF and growth. The index is a measure of institutional quality that provides insight into the characteristics of an environment conducive to prosperity. A glance at the index components reveals several reasons to expect that countries with higher levels of EF will have greater absorptive capacity, and thus allow them to reap more benefits from FDI spillovers. First, there is broad agreement within the profession that, in general, less regulation would be good for economic progress. It is well known that a free and competitive market provides greater opportunities for entrepreneurs to try out new ideas. It also encourages firms to engage in risky ventures such as FDI-related activities, in search of higher returns for their investment. On the other hand, if the market is extensively regulated, it will not function well, and hence the allocation of resources would be adversely affected in such an environment. For example, if financial markets are extensively regulated, FDI-related activities will be affected as firms need external funds to finance the adoption of new technology (Alfaro et al., 2004).",1
66,5,"The provision of incentives (i.e., tax incentives and/or subsidies) and the adoption of FDI-stimulating policies stem from the expectation that FDI will bring tremendous benefits to the recipient countries. MNCs have been linked to superior technologies, patents, trade secrets, brand names, management techniques, and marketing strategies (Dunning, 1993). Besides that, MNCs are known to be among the most technologically advanced firms, as they are responsible for a large part of the world's R&D expenditures (Borensztein et al., 1998). They also hire a large number of technical and professional workers (Markusen, 1995). Through FDIs, the recipient countries are granted instant access to new technology that may benefit those receiving the foreign capital, and also other firms in the host country. To the extent that FDIs add to the existing capital stock, they may have growth effects similar to domestic investments, in addition to alleviating the balance-of-payment deficits. Besides labor augmentation, MNCs train managers and workers who may then later join local firms. FDIs (especially export-oriented FDIs) may promote export by setting up assembling plants and helping local firms to access international markets for exports (Aitken et al., 1997).",1
66,6,"It has also been argued that the adoption of new technologies requires labor that is able to understand and work with the new technology. On this issue, Borensztein et al. (1998) found that FDI inflows only had a marginal direct effect on growth, but in countries where human capital was above a certain threshold it did positively contribute to growth (i.e., when FDI was interacted with the level of education of a country's labor force). The same interaction effect was not significant in the case of domestic investment, which may reflect the nature of technological differences between FDI and domestic investment. This finding implies that because developed countries have a higher level of human capital, they are more likely to gain from FDIs than developing countries. This conjecture is further supported by Xu (2000) who found that technology transfer by U.S. MNCs contributed to the productivity growth in developed countries, but not in developing countries. Unlike the two articles mentioned above, Alfaro et al. (2004) found that human capital was not important for mediating FDI inflows. Instead, Alfaro et al. (2004) suggested that the development of the financial sector was more important than human capital for FDI spillovers.",1
66,7,"Although empirical evidence on the link between FDI and growth is mixed, evidence on the role of institutions in the development process is more compelling. North (1990), perhaps today's bestknown economic ＆institutionalist,＊ defines institutions as the humanly devised constraints or rules of the game that structure political, economic, and social interaction. Important elements of these are formal rules (e.g., constitutions, laws, and property rights sustained through courts, and the police) and informal constraints (e.g., sanctions, taboos, customs, traditions, and codes of conduct). He further states that institutions provide the incentive structure of an economy. As the structure evolves, it shapes the direction of economic change towards growth. In short, institutions affect security of property rights, prevalence of corruption, distorted or extractive policies, and thereby affect the incentive to invest in human and physical capital, and hence economic growth.",1
66,8,"A number of recent papers empirically confirm the importance of institutions for economic development. Knack and Keefer (1995) pioneered the use of property right security indicators in the growth literature, with the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) and Business Environment Risk Guide (BERI) indices as proxies for institutional quality. These institutional indicators include quality of bureaucracy, property rights, and the political stability of a country. Their cross-country estimation results indicate that all these factors have a positive statistically significant relationship with economic performance. On this point, Barro (2000) argues that secure property right improves growth performance by encouraging investments, and also by enhancing the productivity of investments. Meanwhile, Demetriades and Law (2006) find that stronger institutions are more important than financial developments in explaining output per capita in low-income countries. Rodrik et al. (2004) show that quality of institutions overrides geography and integration (i.e., international trade) in explaining cross-country income levels. Acemoglu et al. (2001) use the protection from the expropriation risk index constructed by the ICRG as a measure of efficiency of current institutions. ",1
66,9,"In short, empirical studies on FDI每growth relationship remain limited particularly with respect to the effects of EF on FDI spillovers. Arguably, countries that promote greater freedom of economic activities are more likely to gain from the presence of MNCs. While this is a plausible conjecture, as of yet there is no hard empirical evidence to support the view that EF makes a difference to the way in which FDI affects economic growth. Such evidence is clearly the logical next step in the evolution of the literature on FDI and growth.",1
66,10,"The GMM estimators are typically applied in one- and two-step variants (Arellano and Bond, 1991). The one-step estimators use weighting matrices that are independent of estimated parameters, whereas the two-step GMM estimator uses the so-called optimal weighting matrices in which the moment conditions are weighted by a consistent estimate of their covariance matrix. This makes the twostep estimator asymptotically more efficient than the one-step estimator. However, the use of the two-step estimator in small samples, as in our study, has several problems. These problems result from the proliferation of instruments. In a simulation analysis, Windmeijer (2005) shows that the two-step GMM estimation with numerous instruments can lead to biased standard errors and parameter estimates. Moreover, Bowsher (2002) shows that numerous instruments may lead to a weakened over identification test. The author shows that the test is undersized and never rejects the null of joint validity at 0.05 or 0.10, rather than rejecting it 5% or 10% of the time as a well-sized test would. In order to alleviate the problems induced by the proliferation of instruments, Roodman (2009b) recommended reducing the dimensionality of the instrumental variable matrix.",1
66,11,"This section presents the empirical findings using the three different approaches discussed in Section 5. The empirical results are presented in Tables 1每5. Table 1 reports a preliminary analysis on the effects of FDI and EF on growth. Table 2 presents coefficient estimates obtained from the baseline specification, which used an interaction term constructed as a product of FDI and EF index. Table 3 reports the coefficients estimate from a specification that uses dummies to capture the contingency impact of FDI on growth at different levels of EF. Table 4 displays the estimated coefficient obtained using sample splitting under which linear growth每FDI relationships are estimated using two different subsamples. Finally, the results on the interaction specification using the components of EF index are displayed in Table 5. Our aim is to show whether the component of the EF index yields qualitatively similar results to that of the aggregate index.",1
66,12,"Numerous researchers have investigated the impact of FDI on economic growth. Unfortunately, the empirical literature has produced conflicting conclusions. In more recent studies, the absorptive capacity of the recipient countries appears to be the key explanation for this ambiguity. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate a new aspect of absorptive capacity, namely EF. Specifically, this paper assesses whether the marginal impact of FDI on growth depends on the freedom of economic activities in the host countries.",1
66,13,"Using a panel data for 85 countries over the 1975每2004 period, we draw three important conclusions from the empirical analysis. First, as in earlier studies, we find that FDI by itself has no direct impact on output growth. Second, EF is found to be an important driver for long-run growth for the countries considered. The positive correlation (direct link) between EF and growth is also consistent with the findings reported in de Haan and Sturm (2000) and Sturm and De Haan (2001), to mention two. Finally, as it is shown in the empirical evidence, the impact of FDI on growth is contingent on the level of EF. We find that the countries under review (including the developing countries) that promote freedom of economic activities gain significantly from the MNCs' presence. In these countries, firms can more easily absorb and adopt new technology and other benefits associated with FDI inflows. This also explains why the benefits accrued from acquisition FDI and their association with foreign multinationals with performance advantage is higher for some countries and not others. We consider this is an important result as it suggests that EF is an important element of the nation's absorptive capacity, but it has been somewhat ignored in earlier studies.",1
66,14,"Freedom of exchange across borders may help domestic firms penetrate international markets for exporting purposes. Among other aspects, export activity involves costs associated with the establishment of distribution networks, transport infrastructures, or knowledge of consumers' tastes in foreign markets, which MNCs are more able to afford. By following the export processes of foreign firms (through imitation or collaboration), domestic firms may reduce the entry costs into the foreign market. The gains obtained in this way may have favorable implications on the productive efficiency of domestic firms. Trade may also enhance the productivity of resources at home by enabling domestic firms to employ a larger variety of intermediate products and capital equipment (Romer, 1990).",1
66,15,"Reducing regulatory constraints (e.g., labor, business and credit) is also importance for FDI spillovers. For instance, fewer regulations in hiring and firing workers in the host country will encourage labor mobility across firms. Therefore, workers previously employed with MNCs are more able to transfer their knowledge and experience of new technologies to domestic firms. The level of regulations on business activities may affect FDI spillovers through its effects on market competition. MNCs may be more willing to transfer technology to domestic suppliers in order to secure intermediate goods at a competitive price if the level of competition in the industry in which they operate is high (i.e., high level of regulatory freedom). The importance of financial markets for FDI spillovers was documented by Alfaro et al. (2004) who emphasized that firms need external funds for technology upgrading. Therefore, any effort that improves access to external funds, such as reducing regulatory constraints, will have a positive implication on the success of domestic firms in acquiring new technology.",1
66,16,"In this respect, policymakers should weigh the cost of policies aimed at attracting FDI versus those that seek to improve the level of EF. Policy strategies directed towards attracting FDI should be in conjunction with, rather than precede, policies promoting better freedom of economic activities, because more freedom is likely to deliver greater benefits. Countries that have not done so will lose out in the race. Policymakers should create policies transparent enough for potential investors before using other measures for attracting higher levels of FDI. However, the reforms can be an arduous process and requires a long-term commitment. In some countries, they may be politically difficult in the short run but the long-run economic benefits can be tremendous.",1
66,17,"Despite these important findings, some caveats are in order. One limitation is that the interaction term in our main specification forces the impact of FDI on growth to increase (or decrease) monotonically with the level of EF. However, it may be the case that a certain level of EF is required before FDI can have any impact on host countries. As noted by World Bank (2001) and others, only countries with the greatest absorptive capacity are likely to benefit from the presence of foreign capital. In countries with low absorptive capacity, the benefits of FDI are muted or non-existent. This suggests the need for a more flexible specification that can accommodate different types of interactions between FDI, output growth, and economic freedom. One possible solution is to employ a regression model based on the concept of threshold effects to capture the presence of contingency effects (see for example Girma, 2005). We leave this possibility for future research.",1
