70,1,"After a decade of devolution and amid uncertainties about its effects, it is timely to assess and reflect upon the evidence and enduring meaning of any ＆economic dividend＊ of devolution in the UK. Taking a multi-disciplinary approach utilising institutionalist and quantitative methods, this paper seeks to discern the nature and extent of any ＆economic dividend＊ through a conceptual and empirical analysis of the relationships between spatial disparities, spatial economic policy and decentralisation. Situating the UK experience within the historical context of its evolving geographical political economy, we find: i) a varied and uneven nature of the relationships between regional disparities, spatial economic policy and decentralisation that change direction during specific time periods; ii) the role of national economic growth is pivotal in explaining spatial disparities and the nature and extent of their relationship with the particular forms of spatial economic policy and decentralisation deployed; and, iii) there is limited evidence that any ＆economic dividend＊ of devolution has emerged but this remains difficult to discern because its likely effects are over-ridden by the role of national economic growth in decisively shaping the pattern of spatial disparities and in determining the scope and effects of spatial economic policy and decentralisation.",1
70,2,"The idea of an ＆economic dividend＊ has gained significant momentum in the UK and internationally as a powerful and persuasive argument in the politics and economics of decentralisation; reflecting a broader international shift from identity to economy rationales in contemporary forms of state modernisation and ＆rescaling＊ (Lobao et al. 2009; Rodr赤guezPose and Sandall 2008). The ＆economic dividend＊ is principally articulated in terms of generating allocative and productive efficiencies alongside the accountability and participation benefits of decentralisation for decision-making and co-ordinating collective action in support of economic development (Rodr赤guez-Pose and Gill 2005). In the UK in the late 1990s, for example, political advocates argued for devolution in Wales to improve its economic performance and productivity to create more and better jobs (Davies 1999). Regional government in the English regions too was promoted as an ＆economic imperative＊ to address the ＆economic deficit＊ of persistent spatial disparities between London, the Greater South East region and the rest (Murphy and Caborn 1996).",1
70,3,"More than a decade on from the main constitutional and devolutionary reforms in the UK, it is timely to assess and reflect upon the evidence and enduring meaning of the ＆economic dividend＊ of devolution in the UK. Little research has been undertaken on this issue to date because it is a far from straightforward task, given the view that its impacts are ※likely to be complex, subtle and difficult to measure§ (Jeffery 2006: 1). Problems include: the development of appropriate proxies relevant to particular national contexts; assembling available data of appropriate quality, historical coverage and international comparability; disentangling and isolating the effects of decentralisation; and, attributing causation amongst decentralisation＊s myriad relationships with broader economic and institutional change (Ashcroft et al. 2005; McGregor and Swales 2005).",1
70,4,"The approach taken here is multi-disciplinary, encompassing Economic and Political Geography, Local and Regional Development and Political Science. It utilises a geographically political economy that seeks to embed its institutionalist and quantitative analysis in its appropriate context of the unfolding histories of institutional, political and economic change over time and space within the particularity of the UK state. The argument is that analysis of any ＆economic dividend＊ of devolution in the present needs to be rooted in the past evolutions of spatial disparities, spatial economic policy and decentralisation within the political-economies of particular nation states. The historical dimension of the analysis is critical in understanding the path dependencies that shape the evolution of institutional structures and policy approaches over time and space, reflecting legacies of political choices, strategies and struggles.",1
70,5,"With the aim of assessing and reflecting upon the evidence and enduring meaning of the ＆economic dividend＊ of devolution in the UK over a decade after the institutional and political reforms introduced from 1997, the paper first addresses some conceptual issues in considering the relationships between spatial disparities, spatial economic policy and decentralisation. Second, the historical context and unfolding of the UK experience is outlined. Third, given the constraints of comparable data availability, the analysis focuses upon the period 1984-2007 in an attempt to discern the existence (or otherwise), extent and nature of any ＆economic dividend＊ arising from the inter-relation of spatial disparities, spatial economic policy and devolution in the UK. Last, some conclusions and reflections are provided.",1
70,6,"Given its complex and unclear inter-relationships, one approach is to situate the consideration of any ＆economic dividend＊ arising from devolution within an understanding of the changing relations between spatial disparities, spatial economic policy and decentralisation. An evolution is evident in the ways in which spatial disparities are understood and explained with implications for how spatial economic policy and decentralisation are formulated and unfolded. We discern stylised kinds of approaches 每 redistributive, free-market and growthoriented 每 with different characteristics concerning their economic theory, causal explanation of spatial disparities, adjustment process, policy rationales and instruments, institutional organisation, geographical focus and scope, political-economic project and language (Table 1) (see also OECD 2009). Spatial economic policy is seen as forms of economic policy with spatial intent 每 such as regional or urban policy. We recognise the need and difficulty of disentangling this from economic policy without explicit spatial intent but with spatial implications 每 such as macro-economic, welfare or defence policy. We acknowledge too the more recent debates about ＆spatially neutral＊ or ＆blind＊ policy that is focused upon ＆people＊ rather than ＆place＊ and explains spatial disparity as the compositional outcome of sorting processes driven by rational economic agents (see, for example, Overman 2010).",1
70,7,"Such transitions in spatial economic policy and its organisation reflect developments within economic theory and their differing causal explanations for spatial disparities and views of adjustment processes. Such conceptual and theoretical ideas are then mediated and translated into policy rationales and instruments within the institutional structures of particular national political economies (Pike and Tomaney 2009). Uneven, partial and messy transitions, overlaps and struggles undoubtedly mark the political economy of such shifts that play out in different ways in different national contexts. Indeed, part of the aim of this paper is to outline how this process has unfolded in the particular context of the UK.",1
70,8,"Integrally related to the changes in how spatial disparities are interpreted and spatial economic policy formulated is a marked shift in the geographical scale and level of institutional organisation, delivery and governance from centralisation toward varied forms of decentralisation. Indeed, it is critical to recognise that devolution is only one particular form of decentralisation and itself comes in different shapes and sizes, driven top-down and/or bottom-up by different levels of state and non-state actors, and with differing motivations and expectations (Rodr赤guez-Pose and Gill 2005; Torrisi et al. 2010). Table 2 outlines the main types which vary in their degree of autonomy in fiscal and functional terms, balance of reserved and decentralised powers and responsibilities, and administrative and/or democratic accountability. In emphasising the importance of historical context and evolution of national political economies, it is evident that as a ＆new state spatiality＊ decentralisation will be highly variegated in different nation states (Peck and Theodore 2007).",1
70,9,"In considering whether and what any ＆economic dividend＊ might mean, conceptualising the potential economic benefits and costs of decentralisation is central. Informed by the key arguments from fiscal federalism that focuses upon the vertical structure of the public sector and the existence of allocative and productive efficiencies and accountability and participation, Table 3 summarises some of the main issues. Several other concerns are also important to the analytical task. First, decentralisation is widely acknowledged as a process rather than a one-off event; there is little sense in splitting the analytical frame into ＆pre-＊ and ＆post-＊devolution periods. Indeed, understanding and capturing the timing and lag of any potential benefits and costs flowing from decentralisation has bedevilled studies to date (McGregor and Swales 2005). Second, it is important to distinguish the expected or likely benefits and costs of specific forms of decentralisation such as devolution from what are considered the unexpected, unlikely and/or somehow additional bonus or windfall economic implications implied by the term ＆dividend＊. Last, given that much of the discussion of the ＆economic dividend＊ to date has focused upon potential efficiency benefits, attention is required to the equity concerns of the distributional impacts of decentralisation in economic, social and geographical terms.",1
70,10,"While the aspiration might be to produce some kind of assessment of the overall net balance of economic outcomes generated from both positive and negative effects of devolution, the inter-relatedness of spatial disparities, spatial economic policy and decentralisation involved means a more finely grained and nuanced account is required. Analysts searching for the ＆economic dividend＊ need to accept that it may or may not exist and that its extent and nature over time and space are likely to be highly variable and differentiated; reflecting potentially strong, weak and indifferent degrees of both positive and negative impacts as well as place-specific spill-overs from the economic into different kinds of political, social and cultural domains in the political economies of particular nation states and territories.",1
70,11,"Entrenched and persistent spatial disparities have marked the UK, especially since the 1930s, and continue to exert an enduring influence upon the national political economy, politics and policy (Figure 1). Significantly, traditional interpretations of spatial disparities emphasised the economic inefficiency (rather than benefit or dividend) of the geographic overconcentration and centralisation of economic activities in London and the Greater South East (Martin 2008), hampering national economic growth because of the rapid generation of inflationary bottlenecks in factor markets during periods of expansion that were stymied by macro-economic policy before their benefits could trickle down to the peripheral regions (Armstrong and Taylor 2000). Informed by the new economic geography (e.g. Krugman, 1991), more recent explanatory narratives emphasise the economic benefits and even dividends of spatial disparities in the UK based upon the powerful growth enhancing benefits of localised agglomeration in London and the Greater South East. This analysis argues that any spatial policy should aim to correct market failures in support of this geographic concentration because dilution or redistribution of its effects would be detrimental to overall growth and welfare (see, for example, Leunig and Swaffield 2008).",1
70,12,"The UK＊s experience of persistent spatial disparities has configured a long history of spatial economic policy focused upon the regional scale, punctuated by ＆policy on＊ and policy off＊ episodes alongside ongoing, periodic scrutiny and reflection upon its principles and purpose (see, for example, Barlow 1940; Harrison and Hart 1993; House of Commons 1995; 2003). Inter-war efforts focused upon addressing localised concentrations of high unemployment and poverty generated by industrial decline in South Wales, northern England and west central Scotland (Martin 1988). After 1945, post-war consensus and persistent cross-party support for regional policy was predicated on traditional efficiency and equity rationales as well as the desire for class-based national parties to avoid the emergence of separate territorial politics (Gordon 1990). ＆Spatial Keynesianism＊ (Martin and Sunley 1997) marked state intervention through regional policy, focused upon investment and stimulation of cumulative causation and the management of aggregate demand and employment in the regions (Kaldor 1970). ",1
70,13,"Despite some success in job creation and economic diversification in the Assisted Areas (Taylor and Wren 1997), the political-economic tide turned away from Keynesianism and its redistributive spatial policy toward neo-liberalism following the crisis of stagflation, industrial strife and public fiscal imbalances during the 1970s. Characterised by deregulation, liberalisation and the attempted ＆rolling-back＊ of the state, the UK variant led by Margaret Thatcher＊s Conservative administrations from 1979 emphasised individual responsibility, free markets and enterprise which underpinned the critique and dismantling of regional policy during the 1980s. The turn toward neo-classical economics and the free market interpreted Keynesianism and regional policy as distortions and impediments to rational and efficient decision-making amongst economic actors. Subsidies were seen as economically inefficient and wasteful, causing ＆deadweight＊ effects in supporting activities that would have occurred anyway and unable to tackle structural problems including lack of enterprise and innovation (Wren 2005).",1
70,14,"In contrast to the Keynesian emphasis upon demand, neo-classical theory emphasised intervention to enhance the flexibility and upgrading of the supply-side of factor markets such as labour skills. Structural change toward services in the UK economy favoured regions and localities around London and the Greater South East, sharpening the North-South Divide in spatial disparities (Martin 1988). Spatial economic policy under Thatcherism reduced spending, shrunk the map of eligible Assisted Areas, changed support from automatic to discretionary selectively to encourage small enterprise and the attraction of international inward investment flows in the context of the Single European Market (see Figure 2). Formerly state-owned industries such as coal, steel and shipbuilding were privatised and rationalised with highly damaging localised impacts (Hudson 1989). The geographical focus of spatial policy shifted to the urban and the institutional lead and resources were transferred from local government to new special purpose bodies such as Urban Development Corporations and Local Enterprise Agencies (Martin and Tyler 1992). ",1
70,15,"The UK＊s long history as a highly centralised, multi-national ＆union state＊ has shaped the evolution of its institutional structures in formulating and delivering spatial economic policy with only limited and conditional decentralisation. Variegation is evident in the UK state＊s institutional forms, powers and resources within its nations and regions through cumulative administrative decentralisation to the Scottish Office (from 1885), Wales Office (1964), Stormont Parliament (1921) and Government Offices in the English regions (1994). Despite the short-lived experiment with Regional Planning Councils in England during the 1960s and the establishment of the Welsh Development Agency (WDA) and Scottish Development Agency (SDA) in the mid-1970s, centralisation has marked the institutional arrangements for addressing spatial disparities through spatial economic policy.",1
70,16,"Following the programme of devolution and constitutional change from 1997, the geographically differentiated institutional and political legacy was effectively built upon by further but highly uneven democratic decentralisation, creating a multi-level, polycentric UK state working across several geographical scales and representing a more distributed landscape of political power (Morgan 2007). Despite such reforms, the UK remains highly centralised in comparison to other western European states (Marks et al. 2008). The new arrangements comprised an asymmetrical hierarchy of powers and resources ranging from the Parliament in Scotland, through the National Assemblies in Wales and Northern Ireland, to the Mayoralty and Assembly in London and, until their abolition in 2010, the Regional Development Agencies and indirectly elected Regional Chambers in the English regions (Tomaney 2000). Territorial politics have subsequently been reinvigorated and become evident in varying degrees of differentiation in spatial economic policy and varieties of institutional organisation divergent from national, largely English-regions focused frameworks (Adams et al. 2003).",1
70,17,"England＊s size and weight within the UK 每 constituting some 80% of the total population and nearly 90% of GDP 每 renders considerations of governing its uneven development and growth important and difficult for the UK state (Morgan 2001). The political and institutional settlement for the English regions remained ＆unfinished business＊ (Tomaney 2000). Given a central economic leadership role, the RDAs were established in 1998 as ※an essential first step to provide for effective, properly co-ordinated regional economic development... and to enable the English regions to improve their competitiveness§ (Department of Environment 1997: 1), accountable nationally through their sponsoring Department and Minister and regionally through indirectly elected Regional Chambers.",1
70,18,"The widely touted and anticipated ＆economic dividend＊ predicated upon heightened autonomy, resources and political voice at the national centre was seen as a potential route to a step-change in economic performance capable of closing the prosperity gap with London and the Greater South East on a sustainable basis. Echoing the concepts we outlined earlier, the potential ＆economic dividend＊ attached to such devolution was to be delivered through enhanced autonomy to design and implement policies tailored to regional and local needs (allocative efficiencies) and more responsive, effective and accountable governance systems providing decentralised institutional capacity to mobilise and shape collective action for developmental ends (productive efficiencies). Amidst its weak powers, the uneven enthusiasm as well as hostility in central government, the lack of faith in national government late in its second term and the broader currents of distrust in politicians and politic institutions, the particular form of ERAs proposed were rejected 3:1 in the sole referendum in North East England in late 2004 (Rallings and Thrasher 2005).",1
70,19,"As the territorial politics of devolution shaped the particular developments in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the vacuum left by the faltering regionalism and regionalisation projects in the English regions was filled by a range of emergent spatial imaginaries claiming to offer an institutional fix for the persistent problem of governing spatially uneven development: resurgent cities and/or city-regions as motors of their regional economies enhancing their economic performance; localism led by local authorities capable of decentralised approaches to economic development; and pan-regionalisms focused upon cross-regional issues including housing, jobs and infrastructure in newly designated ＆Growth Areas＊, housing market renewal areas in northern cities and the Northern Way linking RDA activity to close the productivity gap with London and the Greater South East across the three northern regions (Pike and Tomaney 2009). Following the election of the coalition government in 2010, debate has raged about the shift in focus toward ＆decentralisation＊ and ＆localism＊ and the dismantling of the regional tier through the winding-up of the RDAs and the abolition of Government Offices for the Regions. ",1
70,20,"That ＆devolution is a process not an event＊ (Davies 1999) in the words of the former Secretary of State for Wales has become a well worn descriptor that nonetheless characterizes the evolutionary and unfolding nature of decentralisation. Hence, while the analysis here is focused upon discerning the existence or otherwise of a ＆economic dividend＊ in the UK following the substantive institutional changes introduced through devolution and constitutional change from 1997, the argument is that such changes need to be situated in the context of relationships between spatial disparities, spatial economic policy and decentralisation and reflect deep seated currents and legacies from previous eras of change. Our approach is based on the combined historical paths of three key elements 每 spatial disparities, spatial economic policy and decentralisation 每 during a period ranging from 1984 to 2007 (local revenue data are only available for a shorter period from 1987). Building upon Rodr赤guez-Pose and Gill (2004), we simultaneously consider the historical evolution of spatial disparities and decentralisation but introduce a new dimension by augmenting the analysis with a quantitative measure of spatial economic policy.",1
70,21,"More than a decade after the constitutional reforms of the late 1990s which brought devolution to parts of the UK, this article has sought to assess and reflect upon the evidence and enduring meaning of the ＆economic dividend＊ of devolution in the UK. Acknowledging the difficulties and methodological challenges involved in seeking to discern such a complex, subtle and difficult to measure entity (Jeffery 2006), a multi-disciplinary and geographical political economy approach has been adopted. This study has sought to embed any relationships between decentralisation, spatial economic policy and changes in spatial disparities in their appropriate context of the unfolding histories of institutional, political and economic change over time and space within the particularity of the UK state. The UK＊s highly centralised system has marked its particular evolution and established a constrained context for any ＆economic dividend＊ to emerge. This contrasts the more substantive and extensive fiscal decentralisation in other countries which have experienced stronger, more widespread, positive effects under certain conditions (Rodr赤guez-Pose and Ezcurra 2010).",1
70,22,"The analysis has revealed a number of interesting points. First is the varied and uneven nature of the relationship between spatial disparities, spatial economic policy and fiscal devolution in the UK, with important changes in direction during the period under analysis. Second, the role of national economic growth is pivotal in explaining the evolution of spatial disparities and the nature and extent of their relationship with the particular forms of spatial economic policy and decentralisation deployed. The dominance of national economic growth within the current forms of more growth-oriented forms of spatial economic policy has reinforced its decisive explanatory role, underlining the emergent tradeoff between national economic growth and politically tolerable levels of spatial disparities (Martin 2008).",1
70,23,"Our findings lead us to conclude that even when it might be discerned, any ＆economic dividend＊ of devolution is likely to be highly variable, taking different forms and degrees, and may be episodic or fleeting in its duration. It appears highly contingent upon particular paths of state institutional change across a range of scales and to be strongly shaped by national economic growth, the nature of fiscal autonomy and capacity and willingness for redistribution on the part of national central states. We acknowledge, however, that it might be that the timescale of our assessment may be too foreshortened and that much more than a decade needs to elapse before the effects of any ＆economic dividend＊ become more apparent. In addition, improvements are needed in data availability and methodological development to help create further proxies and indicators.",1
70,24,"Amidst the territorial politics of the UK＊s nations and regions, contestation over the existence, nature and scale of any ＆dividends＊ associated with devolution continue to unfold, further stoked by the emergence of a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2010. The uneven ways in which devolution has been unfurled across the UK＊s polycentric political economy continues to generate political controversy. In 2010, for example, a Scotland Office review found that 1999 public expenditure in Scotland by both the central and devolved administration exceeded the total revenue raised from across Scotland by ㏒75.8bn. This led the then Scottish Secretary Jim Murphy to claim that ※Scotland has two governments spending billions of pounds of public money and there is a clear and quantifiable ＆devolution dividend＊. Scotland gets the best of both worlds from devolution§ amidst protests from the Scottish National Party that the figures were inaccurate. The continued relevance of this concern with the economic and indeed other dividends of devolution warrants further studies, especially international comparative work.",1
71,1,"This paper describes an approach developed to measure regional economic resilience across Europe which is novel in three key dimensions. Firstly, it seeks to date regional downturns as opposed to assuming that all regional economies are affected by economic shocks at the same point in time; secondly, it measures the amplitude and duration of economic downturns and subsequent recoveries; and thirdly, as well as measuring recovery, it measures the resistance of regional economies to economic shocks. The paper applies this methodology to selected European countries to provide an analysis of differential regional responses to several economic shocks since the early 1990s. The paper then reflects upon the utility of this methodology for operationalising regional economic resilience in crosscomparative studies.",1
71,2,"The effects of the post-2008 economic crisis across Europe have been widespread and significantly contagious but also highly geographically uneven, thereby drawing attention to differences between regions in their vulnerability to economic shocks and their ability to adapt to serious disruptions in the economic environment (Jones et al, 2010; Martin, 2011; Hadjimichalis and Hudson, 2014). This has intensified the interest of evolutionary economic geographers in the concept of regional economic resilience which offers the potential to illuminate the capacities of local and regional economies to withstand and recover from economic shocks, and to adapt their development paths accordingly (Davies, 2011; Fingleton et al, 2012; Martin, 2012). Given the breadth of the disciplinary origins and applications of the resilience concept however, coupled with the relative newness of evolutionary theorizing in economic geography, the conceptual framing and clarity of the notion of regional economic resilience remains the subject of considerable academic debate (Bristow and Healy, 2014; Martin and Sunley, 2014; Boschma, 2014).",1
71,3,"Nothwithstanding this, economic resilience has quickly gathered credence as a concept with policy-makers and practitioners seeking to understand both why some places are better able than others to withstand economic shocks and/or recover quickly from them, and what they themselves might do to influence these capacities (Dawley et al, 2010; CLES, 2010). Indeed, policy discourse around economic development at national, regional and local scales is increasingly replete with talk of the importance of ＆building a resilient economy＊ (Osborne, 2014).",1
71,4,"Recent years have witnessed considerable growth in the number and variety of resilience indicators and toolkits being used by practitioners eager to understand whether a particular local or regional economy is resilient, and policy-makers keen to assess and benchmark the resilience of their economies relative to others (see, for example, CLES, 2010; Greenham et al, 2013; IPPR North, 2014; ARUP, 2014). However, the practical development of indicators has clearly run ahead of conceptual thinking on resilience. There is indeed no single agreed approach to the measurement of resilience and the growing diversity of indicators risks further diluting the clarity and utility of the resilience concept (Christopherson et al, 2010; Martin and Sunley, 2014). Existing indices remain largely unproven and past indices have proved to be inaccurate in predicting the resilience of economies to the most recent economic crisis (Briguglio et al, 2006). Yet robust measures of resilience are clearly needed, not least to help illuminate what Rose and Krausmann (2013) refer to as ＆actionable variables＊, or the key elements that can be influenced by regional actors in processes of shock recovery. In our rush to identify what makes an economy resilient to economic shocks we are in danger of losing an objective means of first identifying which economies were resilient to an economic shock and which were not.",1
71,5,"The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this debate by developing an approach for operationalising the concept of regional economic resilience in a cross-comparative analysis of the effects of the post-2008 global financial crisis on European regions. We develop an approach which focuses on measuring resilience in terms of post-shock outcomes, but which adapts available methods for dating regional business cycles to capture differences in both the timing of when the shock hit regions, and the amplitude and duration of both the downturns experienced and subsequent recoveries. The paper is now structured as follows. The next section examines the challenges which surround operationalising the complex, evolutionary conception of regional economic resilience. In section three, we detail the distinctive features of our approach, whilst section four illustrates some key results from applying this approach to the regional experiences of the recent economic crisis across Europe. Section five provides reflections on the utility of this approach and the paper concludes by identifying how this may help advance the operationalisation of resilience in cross-comparative research.",1
71,6,"Evolutionary theorists also assert that resilience must be conceived as a multi-dimensional and indeed processual entity. This embraces the need to understand not only the nature and duration of the shock and the region＊s vulnerability to it, but also its capacities to withstand or resist the shock in the first place, the robustness of its firms and institutions in responding to it, and the extent and nature of the regional economy＊s recovery from it (Martin 2012; Martin and Sunley, 2014). This complexity is the source of one of the critical problems which has surrounded much of the resilience literature particularly in relation to its measurement, and that is the tendency to conflate and confuse resilience outcomes and resilience capacities (Bristow and Healy, 2014).",1
71,7,"This implies that in measuring resilience, it is critically important to distinguish between the measurement of a region＊s specific post-shock outcomes, or its revealed resilience, and measurement of the region＊s resilience capacities. Indicators of adaptive capacity, many of which feature in some of the developing policy and practice metrics of resilience referred to earlier, do not reveal resilience. They simply point to resilience capacities or the adaptive mechanisms and processes which imbue a regional economy with the means to be resilient (as Martin and Sunley, 2014). They are the factors that need to be examined in order to understand how and why resilience outcomes vary. These factors may be shaped by a wide range of structural and behavioural factors and attributes, the relative importance of which is subject to increasing debate and which is likely to require both quantitative assessment and a more localized and qualitative ontology (Bristow and Healy, 2014; Martin and Sunley, 2014).",1
71,8,"The appropriate metric for identifying this reference state also needs to be considered. Measuring resilience as performance or outcome also requires identification of comparable economic indicators (such as GDP and employment), an understanding of how to deal with mixed results and trade-offs (e.g. sometimes output will show positive performance whereas employment will not), as well as an understanding of what the perceived resistance or recovery state is in the absence of a known equilibrium. This is particularly challenging when it is apparent that shocks may have a diverse range of hysteretic effects on the development paths of regions, permanently changing the composition of their economies or the behaviour of key actors within them (Martin, 2012). A related challenge is to determine whether resilience is being analysed in absolute terms (how all regions performed relative to the shock) or in relative terms (which regions performed better or were more resilient than others). Resilient outcomes may be judged relative to a region＊s own reference state or ＆norms＊ (pre-shock levels, patterns and fluctuations in these performance indicators). They may also be judged in comparative context (with other regions in the same nation or in other nations).",1
71,9,"A key challenge for any study examining economic resilience is identifying when a shock has actually occurred. Taking the argument that an economy is always reacting to changing circumstances, that it is never actually in a state of ＆equilibrium＊ (Martin, 2012), means that it is always beset by economic shocks, some minor and some major. It is only when these are of a certain magnitude, or occur in a particular context, that the effects become observable. In this regard, economic shocks can be compared to physical earthquakes. Small regular tremors pass without observation except by the most sensitive instruments. More sizeable earthquakes cause greater levels of damage, depending on the extent to which a place had planned and prepared for such an event.",1
71,10,"In this complex setting, identifying the onset of a particular system-wide shock for comparative analysis can be challenging. Whilst it may be tempting to look for a particular incident from which to date a shock, this can serve to confuse cause and effect. For example, although the collapse of the US firm Lehmann Brothers is often cited as a key point in the recent financial crisis, the roots of this lay in the sub-prime mortgage crisis following the collapse of the US housing bubble (Gamble, 2009). The effects of this reverberated around much of the world through a series of complex interactions (Martin, 2011; Hadjimichaelis and Hudson, 2014), coupled with second and third order effects channelled through financial markets, trade links, and behavioural changes, whereby citizens amended their consumption and savings behaviour on the basis of their wider expectations of the future (Hadjimichaelis, 2011; Smith, 2013; Hannon, 2014).",1
71,11,"A further challenge concerns the time period given for resilience outcomes to be revealed. Existing literature suggests that this is very much a matter of judgement. In a study of regional economic resilience in the US, Hill et al (2011) consider a region to be resilient if (as a minimum) it returns to its prior growth path within a relatively short period of time, namely within four years. More generally, questions surround the relationship between short-term resilience to shocks and a region＊s long-run regional development pattern. Martin and Sunley (2014) argue that short-term measures of resilience as ＆bounce-back＊ to some pre-shock state or norm, have to be understood as constitutive of long-term regional growth paths and development trajectories. As such, understanding short-term resilience outcomes may be critical to understanding longer-term patterns of regional convergence and divergence.",1
71,12,"A final challenge is the scale of analysis. Much analysis is undertaken at the national level, but there is increasing interest in the economic resilience of sub-national units, such as regions (Fingleton et al, 2012), cities (Capello et al, 2015), or other administrative or statistical units (Doran and Fingleton, 2014). Resilience to economic shocks may vary by scale however: national economic resilience may not necessarily mean constituent regions and localities, with their diverse characteristics and development paths, will necessarily exhibit resilience to the same shock (Martin, 2012).",1
71,13,"One of the classic conundrums for studies of resilience is how that resilience should be measured. Whilst some writers have taken the approach of developing a basket of indicators (Briguglio et al 2006; CLES, 2010), this may conflate cause and effect. In order to understand what might make a region resilient to economic shocks we need to be able to measure its resilience in a way that does not lead to later problems of autocorrelation.",1
71,14,"We have chosen to use two data series; firstly the level of employment in a region and, secondly, the level of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Pragmatically, both are consistently available on a comparative basis across the EU territory. Employment is a more meaningful measure than GDP as it counts the number of people employed in a region and is less prone to revision (see Coyle, 2014). In addition, it has a social value as there is a tendency in the minds of the public and politicians to regard the possession of a job as a strong indication of the well-being of an economy. However, as GDP is a standard measure of economic wellbeing and tends to be used to measure entry and exit from recession, we also consider this. We use real (in 2005 constant prices) GDP data since this offers a better perspective when tracking income and output resilience over a period of time.",1
71,15,"To understand how resilient regions are, we first need to date their business cycle turning points. We can then calculate the amount of GDP or employment loss between the peak and trough turning points of the cycle. In our approach we treat each region as a separate time series and then date the individual business cycle turning points. This allows us gauge resilience by measuring how much output or employment is lost over downturns, and to calculate the time to recovery. This approach builds on Sensier and Artis (2014) which dates countries within the UK employment cycles, and adds flexibility to the approach of Martin (2012) which assumes that all regions have the same turning point dates as the national employment series.",1
71,16,"For the purposes of our work, we have defined regions as synonymous with the NUTS 2 regional classification of Eurostat.

72,5,"Economic growth highlights those changes occurring in the increase of the macroeconomic results expressed not independently, but in close connection with its determinants. A wide range of both theoretical and empirical studies points out to a great variety of determinants of this process: investment, accumulation of physical capital, human capital, innovation, geography, political and legal institutions, macroeconomic conditions etc. are all considered to play a role in enhancing economic performance (Bassanini and Scarpetta, 2001; Petrakos and Arvanitidis, 2008; Moral-Benito, 2009).",1
72,6,"There have been many attempts to quantify the degree of economic freedom. A heterogeneous range of indicators which aim at quantifying economic freedom has been developed (for example, Economic Freedom of the World from Fraser Institute, Index of Economic Freedom released by Heritage Foundation & Wall Street Journal, World Survey of Economic Freedom from Freedom House). They share several similarities since most of them include in their methodology the core elements of economic freedom: secure private property rights, rule of law, freedom of trade, limited government (Iacobu?? and Gagea, 2010).",1

73,1,This paper introduces Economic Space notion to expand capacity for economic and financial modeling. Introduction of Economic Space allows defining economic variables as functions of time and coordinates and opens the way for treating economic and financial relations similar to mathematical physics equations. Economic Space allows study of economic models on discreet and continuous spaces with different dimensions. The number of risks measured simultaneously determines Economic Space dimension. We present examples of modeling on Economic Space: option pricing and derivation of Black每Scholes每Merton equation on n-dimensional Economic Space; Markov processes and derivation of Fokker每Plank Equations. Usage of Economic Space allows construing approximations of Economics and Finance similar to physical kinetics and hydrodynamics and derives Wave Equations for Economic and Financial variables.,1
73,2,"Economics and finance are systems with extreme complexity similar to complexity of theoretical physics; nevertheless the phenomena of these disciplines are too different. During the last decades Econophysics has delivered many contributions for understanding and modeling economic and financial features (Mantegna & Stanley, 2000; Roehner, 2002; Stanley, 2003; McCauley, 2006; Special Issue, 2008; Schinckus, 2013) and presented many applications of statistical physics methods to economics and finance. Methods and models developed by theoretical and statistical physics might be useful for description of economics and finance. These results present first steps for modeling economic processes with accuracy similar to and with understanding of comparable to current description of physical processes. We treat Econophysics as a way to adopt current methods and schemes of theoretical and statistical physics to economic and financial modeling. Such adoption should follow economic and financial laws and these requirements change foundation basement of most methods and models developed within theoretical and statistical physics.",1
73,3,We study economic analogies of physical schemes that can be useful for economic and financial modeling. One of the most general and common physical notions is the space每time issue. We state a simple question: is it possible to introduce certain analogy of space每time notion for economic and financial modeling and what are the possible advantages? Further we mention such analogy as Economic Space.,1
73,4,"We introduce Economic Space notion as an extension of matter that is already used in economics for many years and thus we assume that Economic Space notion conforms to economic phenomenology. At the same time Economic Space notion allows regarding economic variables as functions of time and Economic Space coordinates. It allows treating economic and financial properties in a way similar to mathematical physics equations and applies methods of current theoretical physics to economic modeling. It is already well known (McCauley, 2006)and we also underline the statement that the lack of conservation laws and symmetries in economics and finance makes differences between economic and physical systems vital. Theoretical physics methods should be changed to obey economic and financial phenomenology. Space每time determines the foundation of theoretical physics and description of Nature. Thus motivation of our study is based on assumption that introduction of Economic Space may give a new look on Economics and build solid foundation for broad usage of theoretical physics methods for economic and financial modeling.",1
73,5,"We introduce Economic Space notion with the goal to study economic variables of economic agents and economic variables of entire macroeconomics as functions of time and Economic Space coordinates. Economic variables can describe Supply and Demand, Loans and Debts, Labor and Taxis, Production Function and Capital and so on. Our definition of Economic Space notion has nothing in common with spatial econometrics (Anselin, 2009) and our approach completely differs from agent-based economics (Judd & Tesfatsion, 2005). We assume that different economic states allow define different ※intrinsic§ Economic Spaces that describe different approximations of economic and financial processes. Existence of such Economic Space and opportunity describes economic variables as functions of time and Economic Space coordinates allows use functional analysis, stochastic functions and modern methods of mathematical physics for economic and financial modeling.",1
73,6,Introduction of Economic Space for economic modeling arises two problems. First: how to define Economic Space? Second: how to measure coordinates of economic variables and how to define the partition of economic variables over certain Economic Space? To solve these problems we suggest use methods that are well known in economics for many years. We refer to Lee (1999); BIS (2011) and BIS (2013) as a small amount of economic and financial risk management studies. Risk management deals mostly with risk ratings of banks and corporations. Risk ratings are provided by international rating agencies like Fitch (2006); Moody's's (2007); S&P (2012) and DBRS (2013). We state that Economic Space notion and economic and financial modeling on Economic Space can be developed on the basis of risk rating practice,1
73,7,"To show that let outline that risk ratings procedures distribute economic agents as companies, corporations, and banks over a finite number of risk grades, like AAA, BB, CCC and so on. Finite number of risk grades can be treated as finite number of points of discreet space. Risk grades of economic agents like banks or corporations can be treated as their coordinates on discreet space. Risk ratings estimations of economic agents are similar to measurements of coordinates of economic agents on discreet space. Ratings of single risk can be treated as coordinates on one-dimensional discreet space. Simultaneous estimations of ratings of n risks of economic agents are similar to measuring coordinates on n-dimensional discreet space. Thus existing risk ratings practices can be treated as procedures that distribute economic agents on discreet space. We suggest mention such space as Economic Space. Let associate risk ratings or coordinates of particular economic agent with coordinates of its economic variables. That defines economic variables of economic agent as functions on Economic Space.",1
73,8,Our treatments of option pricing theory on n-dimensional e-space Rn allow derive extension for the BSM equation and uncover additional difficulties of option pricing modeling. These problems concern requirement to take into account possible changes of main risks that determines current e-space representation. Random dynamics of main risks during time to expiration means that options pricing Eq. (6) should be transformed into other ones on e-space with different axis. That effect might explain variances between predicted and observed option price dynamics. Correct description of these effects might rise up accuracy of option pricing.,1
73,9,"E-space notion uncovers extreme internal complexity of financial and economic systems. Main difficulties concern econometric problems and observation, choice of most valuable risks and measurements of e-particles distributions on e-space. At present, there are no risk ratings methodologies that allow distribute economic agents on Rn. Development of econometric and economic statistics that may establish empirical ground for e-space modeling is the most crucial problem. Cooperative efforts of Rating Agencies and Businesses, Government Statistical Bureaus and Research Communities, Banks and Regulators, etc., are required to establish distributions of economic agents on e-space with one or two dimensions. It is necessary to unify risk ratings methodologies, develop methods to measure and compare different risks, methods to chose most valuable risks and so on. We propose that even simplest model of e-space distributions of macroeconomic variables can allow observe dynamics of economic variables, visualize macroeconomic distributions like Supply and Demand, describe e-space states of Inflation, Financial Markets, Derivatives Markets and more.",1
70,1,"It is timely to evaluate the evidence for any economic benefit of devolution in the UK after ten years of implementation and amidst uncertainties regarding its effects. To achieve this, a multi-disciplinary approach using institutionalist and quantitative methods is employed to analytically and empirically identify the nature and scope of any economic dividend. By examining the relationships between spatial disparities, spatial economic policy and decentralization, the paper highlights the varied and uneven nature of these connections, which change direction during specific time periods, and the fundamental role of national economic growth in determining their outcome. While there is limited evidence of any economic benefit derived from decentralization, it is challenging to distinguish its effects from those of national economic growth, which decisively influences the pattern of spatial disparities and the scope and effectiveness of spatial economic policy and decentralization.",0
70,2,"The concept of an ""economic dividend"" has become increasingly popular in the UK and globally as a compelling argument for decentralisation in politics and economics. This trend reflects a broader shift from identity-based to economy-based rationales for contemporary forms of state modernisation and ""rescaling,"" as noted by Lobao et al. (2009) and RodriguezPose and Sandall (2008). The economic dividend is primarily about achieving allocative and productive efficiencies, as well as accountability and participation benefits, through decentralisation. This helps decision-making and co-ordination of collective action in support of economic development, according to Rodriguez-Pose and Gill (2005). In the late 1990s, proponents of Welsh devolution argued that it could improve economic performance and productivity, resulting in better jobs (Davies, 1999). Similarly, regional government in the English regions was seen as an ""economic imperative,"" addressing the ""economic deficit"" caused by persistent spatial disparities between London, the Greater South East region, and the rest of the UK (Murphy and Caborn, 1996).",0
70,3,"It is important to evaluate and reflect on the long-term impact of devolution on the UK economy, more than a decade after its implementation. However, little research has been conducted on this topic due to its complexity and difficulty in measurement. Challenges include finding suitable proxies, gathering sufficient and comparable data, untangling the effects of decentralization, and determining the causation between decentralization and broader economic and institutional changes. (Ashcroft et al. 2005; McGregor and Swales 2005).",0
70,4,"This study takes a multi-disciplinary approach, combining Economic and Political Geography, Local and Regional Development, and Political Science. It uses a geographically political economy to analyze institutional, political, and economic changes in the UK state over time and space. The study argues that examining the current ""economic dividend"" of devolution must account for past spatial disparities, spatial economic policies, and decentralization within the political-economies of specific nation-states. The historical dimension of analysis is crucial for understanding how past decisions and struggles shape current institutional structures and policy approaches.",0
70,5,"The paper aims to evaluate the evidence and lasting impact of the 'economic dividend' of devolution in the UK, a decade after the introduction of institutional and political reforms in 1997. Firstly, the paper addresses conceptual issues in relation to spatial disparities, spatial economic policy and decentralisation. Secondly, it outlines the historical context and development of the UK experience. Thirdly, the analysis concentrates on the period between 1984-2007 due to the scarcity of comparable data to examine the existence, extent and nature of any ＆economic dividend＊ resulting from the interplay of spatial disparities, spatial economic policy and devolution in the UK. Finally, some conclusions and reflections are provided.",0
70,6,"The complexity and ambiguity of the inter-relationships surrounding the economic benefits of devolution suggests that situating the consideration of any 'economic dividend' within an understanding of the changing relations between spatial disparities, spatial economic policy and decentralisation is necessary. This includes identifying the different types of approaches to the issue 每 redistributive, free-market and growth-oriented 每 and their respective characteristics. It is important to distinguish between spatial economic policy and other forms of economic policy that have spatial implications. The recent debates concerning 'spatially neutral' or 'blind' policy that focuses on 'people' rather than 'place' are also recognized.",0
70,7,"Spatial economic policy and its organization are influenced by economic theories and their explanations for spatial disparities and adjustment processes. These theories are then translated into policy decisions within the institutional structures of each country's political economy. These transitions are often complicated and inconsistent, and are shaped differently in each national context. The purpose of this paper is to examine how these transitions have occurred in the UK. (Adapted from Pike and Tomaney, 2009)",0
70,8,"The interpretation of spatial disparities and formulation of spatial economic policy are closely linked to changes in geographical scale and institutional organization, shifting from centralization to various forms of decentralization. Devolution is just one aspect of decentralization, with different types varying in degrees of autonomy, reserved powers, and accountability. These differences are influenced by state and non-state actors, with varying motivations and expectations. Table 2 outlines the main types of decentralization. As decentralization is influenced by national political economies and historical contexts, it will differ between nation states.",0
70,9,"Conceptualizing the potential economic benefits and costs of decentralization is crucial in evaluating whether and what any ""economic dividend"" might entail. Table 3 presents some of the main issues, informed by the key arguments from fiscal federalism that focus on the vertical structure of the public sector, and allocative and productivity efficiencies, accountability, and participation. However, it is important to keep in mind that decentralization is a process and not a one-time event. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the timing and lag of any benefits and costs linked to decentralization. It is essential to differentiate between expected or likely benefits and costs and the unlikely, unexpected, or additional bonus or windfall economic impacts indicated by the term ""dividend."" Given that much of the discussion of the ""economic dividend"" focuses mainly on potential efficiency benefits, attention is required to address equity concerns regarding the distributional impacts of decentralization in economic, social, and geographical terms.",0
70,10,"It is difficult to produce a comprehensive assessment of the economic impact of devolution because spatial disparities, spatial economic policy, and decentralization are all interconnected. Therefore, analysts should take a more detailed and nuanced approach in order to account for the varied and differentiated nature of the economic dividend over time and space. The extent and nature of positive and negative impacts can vary greatly, and these impacts can spill over into political, social, and cultural domains. This is true for different nation states and territories.",0
70,11,"Spatial disparities have persisted in the UK since the 1930s, influencing the political economy, politics and policy. Initially, spatial disparities were attributed to economic inefficiency due to geographic overconcentration and centralisation of economic activities in the Greater South East, hindering national economic growth. However, more recent economic theory emphasizes the benefits of agglomeration in this region. Therefore, spatial policy should correct market failures to support this geographic concentration instead of redistributing its effects, to ensure overall growth and welfare are not harmed.",0
70,12,"The UK has a history of persistent spatial disparities, which has led to a long-standing focus on regional-scale economic policy. Various policies have been implemented over time, with intermittent periods of implementation and reflection on their effectiveness. Efforts to address high unemployment and poverty in specific areas were made during the inter-war period, while post-World War II policies were driven by efficiency and equity goals, as well as a desire to avoid territorial politics. The concept of 'Spatial Keynesianism' involved state intervention focusing on investment, stimulation of cumulative causation, and management of employment and demand in the regions. Relevant literature includes works by Barlow (1940), Harrison and Hart (1993), House of Commons (1995, 2003), Martin (1988), Gordon (1990), and Martin and Sunley (1997).",0
70,13,"Despite achieving some success in creating jobs and diversifying the economy in the Assisted Areas, the political and economic climate shifted away from Keynesianism and its spatial redistributive policies toward neo-liberalism in the wake of the stagflation crisis, industrial unrest and fiscal imbalances of the 1970s. This UK variant, championed by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government from 1979, emphasized personal responsibility, free markets, and enterprise, thus providing a basis for dismantling regional policy during the 1980s. The turn toward neo-classical economics and the free market saw Keynesianism and regional policy as distortions and obstacles to rational and efficient decision-making among economic actors. Subsidies, which were viewed as economically inefficient and wasteful, were ineffective at addressing structural issues such as the lack of enterprise and innovation.",0
70,14,"Neo-classical theory focused on supply-side intervention to improve factors markets like labour skills, while Keynesian theory emphasized demand. In the UK, service sector growth in the Greater South East worsened spatial disparities, leading to reduced spending and a smaller map of eligible Assisted Areas under Thatcherism. This policy shift encouraged small enterprise and the attraction of international investment flows. Privatisation of formerly state-owned industries like coal, steel, and shipbuilding, however, had negative local impacts. Spatial policy was redirected to urban areas and resources were redirected to new bodies like Urban Development Corporations and Local Enterprise Agencies, away from local government (Martin and Tyler 1992).",0
70,15,"The institutional structures for formulating and delivering spatial economic policy in the UK have been shaped by its history as a highly centralised, multi-national 'union state'. Although there has been some administrative decentralisation to institutions such as the Scottish Office, Wales Office, Stormont Parliament, and Government Offices in the English regions, centralisation has remained the dominant approach to addressing spatial disparities through spatial economic policy. There have been some attempts at regional planning councils in England and the establishment of the Welsh Development Agency and Scottish Development Agency, but overall, the UK's institutional forms, powers, and resources remain variegated.",0
70,16,"The UK's devolution and constitutional changes from 1997 led to further democratic decentralization, resulting in a multi-level, polycentric state with a more distributed landscape of political power. However, compared to other European states, the UK is still highly centralized. The new arrangements established an asymmetrical hierarchy of powers and resources, ranging from Scotland's Parliament to the Mayoralty and Assembly in London. Territorial politics have since become more evident in varying degrees of differentiation in spatial economic policy and institutional organization, divergent from national, largely English-regions focused frameworks.",0

They were accountable both nationally and regionally through their sponsoring department and indirectly elected regional chambers.",0
70,18,"The expected boost in economic performance, known as the ""economic dividend,"" was highly anticipated with the increased autonomy, resources and political voice at the national centre. It was seen as a potential way to close the prosperity gap with London and the Greater South East sustainably. To achieve this, there would be a focus on distributive and productive efficiencies through designing and implementing policies suited to regional and local needs and creating a responsive, effective, and accountable governance system that could mobilise and shape collective action for developmental purposes. Despite the lack of faith in national government and politicians, the proposed ERAs for North East England were still rejected 3:1 in the sole referendum in late 2004 due to their weak powers and uneven enthusiasm and hostility in central government.",0
70,19,"The way devolution worked in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales influenced how regional projects unfolded. However, there was a lack of progress in regionalism and regionalisation in the English regions, so new spatial ideas emerged to tackle uneven development, such as resurgent cities and city-regions, localism led by local authorities, and pan-regionalism looking at issues across regions. After the coalition government was elected in 2010, there was a debate about the shift towards decentralization and localism, and the dismantling of the regional tier by closing Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) and abolishing Government Offices for the Regions.",0
70,20,"'Davies (1999) coined the phrase ""devolution is a process not an event"" which characterizes the gradual nature of decentralization. This article examines the presence of an ""economic dividend"" in the UK following institutional changes from 1997. It argues that an understanding of the relationship between spatial disparities, spatial economic policy, and decentralization is necessary and that these changes are influenced by previous eras of change. To do so, we analyze the historical paths of spatial disparities, spatial economic policy, and decentralization from 1984 to 2007 using local revenue data from 1987. We build upon Rodr赤guez-Pose and Gill's (2004) work and introduce quantitative measures of spatial economic policy.'",0
70,21,"The article aims to assess the 'economic dividend' of devolution in the UK, more than a decade after the constitutional reforms of the late 1990s. The study adopts a multi-disciplinary and geographical political economy approach to explore the complex relationship between decentralisation, spatial economic policy and changes in spatial disparities. The highly centralised system of the UK limits the emergence of any 'economic dividend', in contrast to other countries with more extensive fiscal decentralisation that have experienced positive effects under certain conditions. The study contextualises this relationship within the unfolding histories of institutional, political and economic change over time and space within the particularity of the UK state.",0
70,22,"The examination has disclosed various intriguing points. Firstly, the correlation between spatial incongruities, spatial economic policy, and fiscal decentralization is varied and uneven in the UK, with significant alterations in course during the period analyzed. Secondly, the importance of national economic growth is critical in explaining the progression of spatial disparities and the type and range of their relationship with specific forms of spatial economic policy and decentralization adopted. The predominance of national economic growth within the present growth-oriented methods of spatial economic policy has reinforced its crucial explanatory function, emphasizing the emergent tradeoff between nationwide economic growth and politically acceptable levels of spatial disparities (Martin 2008).",0
70,23,"Our findings indicate that the 'economic dividend' of devolution is likely to differ in form and intensity, and its presence may be temporary or sporadic in duration, despite being detectable. It appears that this is significantly influenced by the specific course of state institutional changes across various scales, as well as by national fiscal autonomy, economic growth, and central governments＊ capacity and willingness to distribute resources. Nonetheless, it's feasible that our evaluation time frame was inadequate, and it may take over a decade for any 'economic dividend' to be seen. Furthermore, there should be improvements in data availabilities, and methodological advances are needed for the development of more proxies and indicators.",0
70,24,"The debate over the benefits of devolution in the UK remains ongoing among the various regions and nations, and has been further fueled by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government's formation in 2010. The implementation of devolution has been uneven, resulting in political controversy. For instance, a review by the Scotland Office in 2010 revealed that public spending in Scotland exceeded revenue by ㏒75.8bn, leading to claims that devolution has provided Scotland with a measurable advantage. However, this assertion was disputed by the Scottish National Party. The issue of the economic and other benefits of devolution should be studied further, particularly through international comparisons.",0
71,1,"In this paper, a new method is presented to measure regional economic resilience in Europe that differs from previous approaches in three important ways. Firstly, it identifies the timing of regional downturns rather than assuming that all regions are affected simultaneously. Secondly, it quantifies both the duration and magnitude of economic downturns and recoveries. Thirdly, it assesses the ability of regional economies to resist economic shocks. The paper applies this method to several European countries, analyzing the different regional responses to various economic shocks since the early 1990s. Lastly, the paper evaluates the utility of this method for cross-comparative studies on regional economic resilience.",0
71,2,"The economic crisis that followed 2008 has impacted Europe in different ways depending on the region's vulnerability to economic shocks and their ability to recover (Jones et al, 2010; Martin, 2011; Hadjimichalis and Hudson, 2014). Regional economic resilience has become an important concept for evolutionary economic geographers to understand a region's capacity to recover and adapt to economic shocks (Davies, 2011; Fingleton et al, 2012; Martin, 2012). However, there is still a debate among academics about the clarity and conceptual framing of regional economic resilience due to the diversity of its applications and newness of evolutionary theorizing in economic geography (Bristow and Healy, 2014; Martin and Sunley, 2014; Boschma, 2014).",0
71,3,"Economic resilience is becoming more widely recognized as a crucial concept for policy-makers and practitioners who want to learn about why some places are better equipped than others to endure, and swiftly recover from, economic shocks. Dawley et al (2010) and CLES (2010) are a few sources that underscore this point. The significance of ""building a resilient economy"" is increasingly emphasized in policy debates concerned with economic development at local, regional, and national levels (Osborne, 2014).",0
71,4,"In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number and range of resilience indicators and toolkits used by practitioners and policy-makers to assess the resilience of local and regional economies. However, the practical development of these measures has surpassed the conceptual understanding of resilience, leading to a lack of consensus on measuring resilience and a potential dilution of its usefulness. Outdated indices have been inaccurate in predicting economic resilience, making it essential to establish reliable measures to determine actionable variables and identify resilient economies. Rushing to identify the characteristics of resilient economies may result in losing an objective means to differentiate between economies that can withstand economic shocks and those that cannot.",0
71,5,"The aim of this paper is to contribute to the discussion on regional economic resilience by creating an approach to measure it through a comparison of the post-2008 global financial crisis effects on European regions. The approach focuses on post-shock outcomes, using available methods to date regional business cycles and capture regional differences in timing, amplitude, and duration of downturns and recoveries. The sections of the paper include an examination of the challenges of operationalising resilience, a description of our approach's unique features, key results from applying this approach to the recent economic crisis in Europe, and reflections on the usefulness of the approach. The conclusion identifies how this approach can advance cross-comparative research on resilience.",0
71,6,"Resilience, according to evolutionary theorists, should be understood as a multi-dimensional and ongoing process. This involves not only understanding the shock and the region's vulnerability to it, but also its ability to resist the shock, the strength of its firms and institutions in responding to the shock, and the extent and nature of the economy's recovery. The complexity of resilience is a critical issue in measuring it, as there is a tendency to conflate resilience outcomes and resilience capacities. This has been a problem in much of the resilience literature (Bristow and Healy, 2014).",0
71,7,"It is crucial to differentiate between a region's revealed resilience and its resilience capacities when measuring resilience. Adaptive capacity indicators do not show resilience, but they reveal the adaptive mechanisms that allow a regional economy to be resilient. These mechanisms should be examined to understand the variability of resilience outcomes. Structural and behavioral factors and attributes influence these mechanisms, and their relative importance is subject to debate. Quantitative assessment and a more localized and qualitative ontology are likely necessary.",0
71,8,"The metric for identifying the reference state needs to be carefully selected. To measure resilience as performance or outcome, comparable economic indicators such as GDP and employment must be identified. It is important to understand how to deal with mixed results and trade-offs and to determine the perceived resistance or recovery state. As shocks may permanently change the composition of economies or the behavior of key actors within them, this can be challenging. Another challenge is determining whether resilience is being analyzed in absolute terms or relative terms. Resilient outcomes may be judged in comparative context or relative to a region's own reference state or norms. (Martin, 2012).",0
71,9,"Identifying when an economic shock occurs is a fundamental challenge for any study on economic resilience. The argument that economies are continually reacting to changing circumstances and never in a state of equilibrium implies that they consistently face minor and major shocks. Only when these shocks reach a certain magnitude or happen in a specific context do their effects become observable. Economic shocks are similar to physical earthquakes, with small regular tremors going unnoticed except by sensitive instruments, and more substantial earthquakes causing varying degrees of damage, depending on the preparedness of the impacted area.",0
71,10,"Identifying the onset of a system-wide shock in a complex setting is challenging. Looking for a single incident to date the shock can confuse cause and effect. For instance, the collapse of Lehmann Brothers is often cited as a key point in the recent financial crisis, but its roots lie in the sub-prime mortgage crisis following the collapse of the US housing bubble. The effects of the shock reverberated across the world through complex interactions and second and third order effects on financial markets, trade links, and behavioural changes. These changes were driven by citizens' modified consumption and savings behaviour based on their expectations of the future.",0
71,11,"There is a challenge when it comes to determining the time period required for resilience outcomes to become apparent. Previous research suggests that there is no clear-cut answer. The study of regional economic resilience in the US by Hill et al (2011) considers a region to be resilient if it returns to its previous growth trajectory within four years. There are concerns about the connection between short-term resilience to shocks and a region's long-term regional development pattern. Martin and Sunley (2014) argue that short-term measurements of resilience as a 'bounce-back' to a pre-shock state or norm are necessary for comprehending long-term regional growth paths and development trajectories. Therefore, understanding short-term resilience results could be critical to comprehending long-term regional convergence and divergence patterns.",0
71,12,"There is a challenge in terms of the scale of analysis, with a lot of analysis being done at the national level. However, there is now more interest in the economic resilience of smaller sub-national units, like regions, cities, or other administrative units. This is because resilience to economic shocks may differ depending on the scale of analysis. Just because the national economy is resilient, it doesn't mean that the smaller regions and localities will also exhibit the same level of resilience, especially considering their unique characteristics and development paths.",0
71,13,"The measurement of resilience has been a challenging issue for researchers. Some have tried to create a set of indicators but doing so may merge cause and effect. To avoid data correlation in the future, it is necessary to determine a method of measuring a region's resilience to economic shocks accurately.",0
71,14,"We opted to utilize two sets of data: the employment levels and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). These data are consistently available and comparable across the EU. Employment is a more significant measure than GDP as it calculates the number of employed individuals and is less prone to alterations. Moreover, it provides a social value as it is considered a sign of the economy's wellbeing. Nevertheless, since GDP is a standard measure of economic prosperity and recession, we also consider it. Using real GDP data (in 2005 constant prices) offers a better view of income and output resilience over time.",0
71,15,"To determine the resilience of regions, we must first identify their business cycle turning points. Then, we can determine the amount of GDP or employment lost during the peak and trough of the cycle. Our method treats each region as a separate time series and dates each business cycle turning point, allowing us to measure resilience by calculating the amount of output or employment lost during downturns and the time it takes to recover. This approach expands upon Sensier and Artis (2014), which dates employment cycles of countries within the UK, and improves upon Martin's (2012) approach, which assumes that all regions have the same turning point dates as the national employment series.",0
71,16,"It has been decided to use the NUTS 2 regional classification of Eurostat to define regions for our work. Despite the fact that there may be some difficulties with this approach (McLeod, 2001), having access to uniform datasets at this level is considered more important. Additionally, for comparative reasons, data at the NUTS 3 territorial level is also used and referred to as 'local' to distinguish it from the regional scale.",0
72,1,Economic growth is a topic that has been extensively researched in specialized literature. It emphasizes the modifications that transpire in improving macroeconomic outcomes that are not expressed on their own but rather interconnected with factors that influence them. The objective of this article is to create a model of economic growth for the European Union members by considering factors such as the economic freedom index and the index of economic progress.,0
72,2,"We have identified two main objectives for our study, which are measuring the strength of the relationship between GDP per capita and the index of economic freedom, and comparing it to the social progress index. Additionally, we aim to model growth rates of these indices for the EU Member States Union. To explore these objectives, we have employed various research methods including descriptive analysis, analysis of variance, correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis.",0
72,3,"We created a regression model that examines how the economic freedom and social progress index impact the growth of GDP per capita in EU member countries. By analyzing variances, we determined that there are significant variations in the average GDP per capita in European countries based on their EU membership status.",0
72,4,"'Since Adam Smith, economic freedom has been proven as the most effective way to achieve prosperity in the liberal tradition. Nonetheless, in order for it to be considered a progress, it must be connected with social and spiritual progress. In a given time and location, economic growth is reflected by the actual increase of economic indicators such as GDP.'",0
72,5,"Economic growth is characterized by changes occurring in the increase of macroeconomic results, which are closely connected with its determinants. Numerous theoretical and empirical studies suggest that various factors contribute to this process, including investment, physical and human capital, innovation, geography, political and legal institutions, and macroeconomic conditions. Scholars such as Bassanini and Scarpetta (2001), Petrakos and Arvanitidis (2008), and Moral-Benito (2009) have examined these determinants and their impact on enhancing economic performance.",0
72,6,"Various methods have been employed to measure economic freedom. Several indicators that attempt to measure economic freedom have been created, such as the Economic Freedom of the World by the Fraser Institute, the Index of Economic Freedom by the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal, and the World Survey of Economic Freedom by Freedom House. These indicators have a few similarities as they commonly use fundamental aspects of economic freedom in their criteria such as protected private property rights, adherence to the rule of law, the freedom to trade, and limited government involvement, as mentioned by Iacobu?? and Gagea in 2010.",0
72,7,"The Index of Economic Freedom from Heritage Foundation & Wall Street Journal is used to analyze economic freedom in this paper. The indicator is an aggregate of 10 components grouped into 4 categories: Rule of law, Limited government, Regulatory efficiency and Open markets. Each component is scored from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a higher degree of freedom. (Heritage Foundation, 2016).",0
72,8,"The dataset comprises of data on 40 European nations. We analyzed variables such as the European Region the country belongs to (""Eastern Europe"", ""Western Europe"", ""Northern Europe"", and ""South of Europe""), membership of the European Union (""Yes"", ""No""), GDP per capita (2014), GDP per capita (2013), Index of Economic Freedom, Index of Social Progress, and GDP per capita growth rate. The data was obtained from sources such as WorldBank, Heritage Organization, and Social Progress Imperative.",0
72,9,"Variance analysis is a statistical technique used to study the variability of a variable in relation to various factors affecting it. The ANOVA technique decomposes the total variance of a dataset into its source components (causes) and compares them to determine if these factors significantly influenced the variable. To analyze the effect of EU membership on the GDP per capita, we used ANOVA. We used correlation analysis to examine the relationship intensity between the economic freedom index and GDP per capita, and the economic freedom index and the index of social progress. A multiple regression model was then used to simulate economic growth for European countries based on the economic freedom index and the index of social progress. This model shows the strength of the relationship between the considered factors and their impact on the studied phenomenon. To validate the econometric model, we checked for the fulfillment of assumptions in both the deterministic and stochastic components. The stochastic component tests assumptions such as the null influence of the error term in the series, the homoscedasticity hypothesis, the independence hypothesis, and the normality hypothesis.",0
72,10,"Economic growth is a multifaceted procedure that aims at the entire economic system and its interactions. It emphasizes the transformations that arise from the enhancement of the macroeconomic outcomes, which are closely associated with their underlying factors.",0
72,11,"The objective of this research was to examine the correlation between economic growth and the index of economic freedom as well as social progress index. Upon conducting a preliminary assessment of the variables' distributions for 40 countries within the sample, we determined that nations in Southern and Eastern Europe recorded lower scores in comparison to other regions. Hence, a large proportion of these countries scored below 63 for the index of economic freedom and lower than 78 in the social progress index.",0
72,12,"We conducted a test to establish if the GDP growth rate is affected by the two indices assessed in our analysis. We utilized a logistic regression model to determine this relationship, but the variables integrated into the model were not statistically important. Consequently, we can conclude that the direction of the GDP per capita growth rate is not influenced by the two indices we analyzed. Other unaccounted-for factors can impact this growth rate.",0
73,1,"This paper introduces the concept of Economic Space, which expands the capacity of economic and financial modeling. Economic Space defines economic variables as functions of time and coordinates, enabling us to treat economic and financial relationships similarly to mathematical physics equations. It facilitates the study of economic models on discrete and continuous spaces with varying dimensions. The Economic Space dimension is determined by the number of risks measured simultaneously. The paper provides several examples of modeling with Economic Space, such as option pricing and the derivation of Black-Scholes-Merton equation on n-dimensional Economic Space, and Markov processes with the derivation of Fokker-Plank Equations. Usage of Economic Space allows approximations of economics and finance akin to physical kinetics and hydrodynamics, and derives Wave Equations for Economic and Financial variables.",0
73,2,"Economics and finance are highly complex systems, similar to theoretical physics. However, the phenomena studied within these fields are quite different. In recent years, the field of Econophysics has made significant contributions to better understanding and modeling economic and financial features using statistical physics methods (Mantegna & Stanley, 2000; Roehner, 2002; Stanley, 2003; McCauley, 2006; Special Issue, 2008; Schinckus, 2013). The methods and models developed in theoretical and statistical physics may also prove useful for accurately describing economic and financial processes. This represents an initial step towards modeling economic processes with similar accuracy and understanding to that of physical processes. We view Econophysics as a means of adapting existing methods and schemes from theoretical and statistical physics to economic and financial modeling while still adhering to relevant economic and financial laws. This approach may ultimately require a re-evaluation of the foundational basis of most existing models developed within theoretical and statistical physics.",0
73,3,"We examine the economic comparisons to physical concepts that could prove beneficial for financial and economic modeling. Among these physical concepts, the space-time issue is a widely-used and general one. We pose a straightforward query - can we establish a correlation between the concept of space-time in physics and economics to reap its potential benefits? In response, we suggest introducing the concept of Economic Space as a parallel analogy.",0
73,4,"We propose the concept of Economic Space as an expansion of the existing notion of matter in economics, with the assumption that it adheres to economic phenomenology. This concept allows economic variables to be seen as functions of time and Economic Space coordinates, making it possible to apply mathematical physics equations and methods of theoretical physics to economic modeling. However, it is important to note that the lack of conservation laws and symmetries in economics and finance make such differences between economic and physical systems crucial, requiring that theoretical physics methods be modified to suit economic and financial phenomenology. We believe that introducing Economic Space could revolutionize economics and establish a strong foundation for using theoretical physics in economic and financial modeling. This study is motivated by the idea that space-time constitutes the basis for theoretical physics and the description of nature.",0
73,5,"We present the concept of Economic Space, which aims to examine economic variables of both economic agents and macroeconomics as functions of time and coordinates in Economic Space. These variables include Supply and Demand, Loans and Debts, Labor and Taxes, Production Function, Capital, and more. It's important to note that our definition of Economic Space is not related to spatial econometrics (Anselin, 2009), and our approach diverges from agent-based economics (Judd & Tesfatsion, 2005). We propose that various economic states can determine distinct ""intrinsic"" Economic Spaces, which offer alternative approximations of economic and financial processes. The existence of such spaces, and the ability to describe economic variables as functions of time and Economic Space coordinates, allows for the use of functional analysis, stochastic functions, and modern methods of mathematical physics for economic and financial modeling.",0
73,6,"The introduction of Economic Space into economic modeling presents two challenges: firstly, how to define Economic Space, and secondly, how to measure the coordinates of economic variables and partition them over a particular Economic Space. To address these issues, we propose utilizing commonly used methods within economics. Specifically, we reference Lee (1999), as well as studies on economic and financial risk management conducted by BIS (2011) and BIS (2013). Such risk management studies principally focus on risk ratings for banks and corporations, which are offered by various international rating agencies (e.g. Fitch (2006), Moody's (2007), S&P (2012), and DBRS (2013)). Thus, we suggest that Economic Space and modeling within it can be developed using practices typically associated with risk rating.",0
73,7,"Risk ratings procedures distribute economic agents, such as companies, corporations, and banks, over a finite number of risk grades. These grades act as points in a discreet space, with each economic agent being assigned coordinates based on their risk rating. The process of risk ratings estimation is akin to measuring the coordinates of economic agents on discreet space. One-dimensional discreet space can be used to represent a single risk rating, while n-dimensional discreet space can be used to represent the simultaneous estimations of ratings of n risks of economic agents. This allows for existing risk ratings practices to be viewed as a method of distributing economic agents on discreet space, referred to as Economic Space. Economic variables can then be defined as functions on Economic Space based on the coordinates of the associated risk ratings or economic agents.",0
73,8,"In order to extend the BSM equation and improve option pricing modeling, we examine option pricing theory on n-dimensional e-space Rn. This reveals the need to consider changes in the main risks that determine the current e-space representation. The random dynamics of these risks during the time to expiration requires transformation of the pricing equation into one with different axis on e-space. This effect may explain discrepancies between predicted and observed option prices, and accurately describing these effects can improve pricing accuracy.",0
73,9,"The concept of e-space reveals the intricate internal workings of financial and economic systems, with challenges arising from econometric issues, risk selection, and measurement of e-particle distributions. Currently, there is a lack of risk rating methodologies capable of distributing economic agents on Rn. Therefore, cooperation among various industry players is vital to establish economic agent distributions on e-space with one or two dimensions. It is crucial to unify risk rating methodologies, develop methods to measure and compare different risks, and choose the most valuable risks to address this issue. Our proposal is that even a basic e-space macroeconomic model can enable observations of economic variables, visualize macroeconomic distributions, and describe e-space states such as Inflation, Financial Markets, Derivatives Markets, among others.",0
