" Our study focuses on evaluating the economic literacy of high school students who are exposed to economic instruction during their senior year. We selected our sample from two large Orange County, California school districts, which comprised seven high schools. All students were mandated to take a semester-long economics course in line with state requirements for high school graduation. We used the Test of Economic Literacy (TEL) as our primary means of performance evaluation. Our findings suggest that pupils' initial grasp of economic fundamentals is limited, with TEL scores revealing room for improvement. Over the course of a semester of structured economic instruction, however, TEL examination scores showed an average improvement of 12.3 percentage points employing pretest-post-test research design."," This study examines the economic knowledge of high school students who undergo economic education in their senior year. The research sample comes from seven high schools across two substantial school districts in Orange County, California. All students enrolled in the economics course are required to complete it for graduation. The Test of Economic Literacy (TEL) is the primary tool for measuring their progress. The research shows that the students have a weak understanding of economics as determined by their initial TEL performance. When one semester of formal economics instruction is provided, the TEL scores improve considerably by an average of 12.3 percentage points using a pretest-post-test design."," The research investigates the economic proficiency of high school seniors who are taking the compulsory semester-long economics class required for graduation in Orange County, California. We surveyed seven high schools within two significant school districts in this area. We used the Test of Economic Literacy (TEL) exam as the primary performance indicator for the pupils. Their initial scores indicated low economic literacy when analyzed by pretest-post-test design. However, after receiving formal economic instruction for a semester, the scores increased dramatically, rising by an average of 12.3 percentage points."
" There is growing recognition across the board of the importance of economic and financial literacy for people of all ages. This is reflected in frequent media coverage and the holding of national summits on the topic. The academic community too has emphasized its significance for many years, with research into effective methods of teaching economics at both high school and college levels. As a result, policymakers and educators are increasingly involved in promoting better economic education among the general public."," Economic and financial literacy has become a topic of great concern in recent years, with experts and educators emphasizing its vital importance to the education of children, teenagers and young adults. There has been significant attention given to the subject by the media, with a special focus on national summits on economic and financial literacy. In addition, a considerable body of academic research has been carried out on the subject, exploring methods of teaching economics in high schools and colleges. This widespread recognition of the importance of economic and financial literacy has led policymakers to take a more active role in ensuring that citizens receive the necessary education to understand and manage their own financial affairs."," The need for economic and financial literacy has emerged as a pressing issue in recent times, with educators and policymakers stressing its importance for people of all ages.

" Our research centered on examining the economic literacy of high school students in Orange County, California. It is noteworthy that since 1985, California has made it mandatory for high school seniors to complete a one-semester course in economics. This course teaches the fundamentals of micro and macroeconomic analyses. Not only is California among the 17 states that require principles of economics instruction at the secondary level, but it is also one of the few states that offer such formal education. However, as far as our knowledge goes, no factual evidence has been gathered on how effective this education is at improving the economic literacy of high school students in California. This study aims to partially fill this gap and provide insightful data on this topic."," Our investigation delves into the economic literacy of high school students in Orange County, California. A crucial finding is that California has required high school seniors to take a semester-long course in economics since 1985. The course imparts the primary principles of micro and macroeconomics. Being among the 17 American states that require formal instruction in economics at the secondary level, California recognizes the importance of economic literacy among its high school students. Remarkably, there is no empirical study to-date that concentrates on the efficacy of this formal economics instruction in improving the economic knowledge of high school students in the state of California. This study hopes to bridge the gap in literature and provide essential insights into this subject matter."," We conducted research to investigate economic literacy among high school students in Orange County, California. We found that since 1985, California has mandated its high school seniors to complete a one-semester course in economics. This course provides a basic understanding of microeconomic and macroeconomic analyses. California is a standout among the 17 states that need fundamental economics instruction at the secondary level. However, there is no empirical research that focuses specifically on the effect of formal economics instructions in enhancing the economic literacy of high school students in the state of California. Our study aims to address this gap and provides relevant information that can further improve economic literacy amongst high school students."
" Our contribution aims to offer new insights on two key policy concerns. The first is linked to the effectiveness of high school economics education in bolstering economic literacy. Previous evidence at the national level suggests that high school economics classes enhance students' performances in standardized economics tests. However, we take a different approach by conducting a single county, single-state research design that incorporates a range of control variables from a custom survey and school records. The second issue we tackle centers on the influence of gender and ethnicity/race on economic literacy. Existing literature primarily at the national level reveals gender differences in economic knowledge before taking an economics course while inconclusive on gender effects on economics learning. Moreover, scant research suggests disparities in economic knowledge by ethnicity and race. We employ our research design to assess gender and ethnicity factors that affect economic literacy both before and after high school economics classes."," This study makes a valuable contribution to two significant policy concerns. The first involves evaluating the effectiveness of high school economics education in improving economic literacy.

However, we conducted a study using a single state, single county research design that incorporates a diverse set of control variables derived from our survey and school records.The second policy issue we address is examining the effects of gender and ethnicity/race on economic literacy. Prior literature mainly at the national level finds gender disparities in economic knowledge before taking an economics course, but the research is inconclusive about gender differences in learning economics. Moreover, there is limited research that highlights distinctions in economic knowledge based on race and ethnicity. We utilize our research design to investigate the impact of gender and ethnicity on economic literacy prior to and post high school economics classes."," Our research makes a notable contribution to two significant policy issues. Firstly, we assess the efficacy of high school economics education in enhancing economic literacy. Prior research highlights that high school economics courses can improve students' performances on standardized economics tests at the national level. However, our unique approach uses a single state, single county research design that includes a comprehensive set of control variables derived from our survey and school records.Secondly, we explore the effects of gender and ethnicity/race on economic literacy, which has major implications for policy.

There is also limited research that provides insights into disparities in economic knowledge based on race and ethnicity. Our study leverages our research design to assess the impact of gender and ethnicity on economic literacy levels before and after high school economics classes."
" By limiting our research to a single state and county, we are able to gain more detailed insight into the factors impacting student achievement in economics. Funding issues and administrative decisions concerning economics instruction can vary greatly among different states and counties, making it difficult to isolate the effects of student characteristics on achievement. By controlling for these differences, our research design allows us to more accurately assess the role of various student characteristics in driving success in economics."," To better understand what contributes to the variations in student achievement in economics, our research is focused on a single state and county. Factors such as funding and the emphasis placed on economics instruction can vary significantly from one state or county to another, making it challenging to control for all the variables impacting student achievement. However, by narrowing our scope in this way, we can better isolate the impact of student characteristics on economics performance, providing clearer insight into what helps students succeed in this subject."," Our research focuses on a single state and county to better understand the reasons why student achievement in economics can vary so widely. Factors including funding issues and administrative decisions relating to economics education are often different from state to state and even from county to county, making it difficult to isolate specific causes. However, by honing in on this specific area, we can better identify the role student characteristics play in achievement to help educators provide better support for their students."
" The study design and methodology had some practical limitations as explained in the Study Methodology, Data, and Characteristics of the Sample section, but the demographics of Orange County are essential in this research.

" According to several studies, it has been found that students who take economics courses have higher levels of economic literacy as compared to those who do not take economics courses, despite economic content being infused in the K-12 curriculum. Data from the Test of Economic Literacy (TEL) shows that students in economics courses scored higher on post-tests than students in social studies classes, both with no economic content and some economic content. In fact, nationwide data also supports this claim, with students in economics courses obtaining the highest scores on the TEL multiple choice examination. Furthermore, controlling for selection bias further confirmed that the economics class had a positive effect on post-test performance.

" Gender-divided economic literacy disparities have been the subject of numerous studies. Siegfried's [1979] article is cited frequently over the gender gap in students' performance. It reports that males typically hold an advantage in understanding economics measured at a specific point in time to a statistically significant, albeit often tiny, extent. More recent works, including those by Watts [1987], Heath [1989], Walstad and Soper [1989], Evans [1992], and Walstad and Robson [1997], have confirmed that a gender gap that favors males continues to exist in high school students' point-in-time evaluations of economic knowledge."," Research examining the economic literacy gap between genders has been conducted and can be found in literary sources. Siegfried's [1979] article is well-known and concentrates on the difference in students' performance between males and females. It concludes that there is typically a slight but statistically significant benefit for men when it comes to understanding economics at a specific time. More modern works, such as those by Watts [1987], Heath [1989], Walstad and Soper [1989], Evans [1992], and Walstad and Robson [1997], reinforce this notion that high school students' point-in-time measures of economic knowledge generally favor males."," The economic literacy difference between genders has been studied extensively and can be seen in the literature. Siegfried's [1979] article is commonly cited when discussing the gender gap in students' performance.

More recent studies, including Watts [1987], Heath [1989], Walstad and Soper [1989], Evans [1992], and Walstad and Robson [1997], have all determined that a gender gap that favors males persists in a high school students¡¯ measurements of economic knowledge."
" According to Siegfried, there is no concrete evidence regarding the inferiority of women in learning economics once other factors that may affect their knowledge accumulation are taken into account. The initial disadvantage that female students experience when taking a pretest-posttest design examination to measure improvements in their economic knowledge does not worsen over time, indicating that women and men learn at similar rates. Recent studies by Jackstadt and Grootaert, Watts, and Allgood and Walstad have yielded similar results showing that gender has no significant impact on learning economics. However, Walstad and Soper found that males perform significantly better than females, a result that was replicated in a later study by Becker and Walstad."," Siegfried argues that no strong evidence supports the notion that women are inferior to men in learning economics, once we take into account other measurable factors that affect economic understanding and knowledge accumulation. When using a pretest-posttest design to evaluate improvements in economic knowledge, women's initial disadvantage does not increase over time, implying that both genders learn at similar rates. This conclusion is consistent with more recent literature by authors such as Jackstadt and Grootaert, Watts, and Allgood and Walstad, who found gender to have no significant effect on learning economics. However, Walstad and Soper found statistically significant differences in learning rates between males and females, a finding that was later replicated by Becker and Walstad."," Siegfried's argument states that the evidence of women's inferiority in learning economics is not strong enough, as there are other significant factors impacting economic comprehension and knowledge accumulation. Interestingly, the initial disadvantage of female students in measurement of improvements of economic knowledge does not grow worse over time. This implies that both genders learn at comparable rates. Studies conducted by Jackstadt and Grootaert, Watts and Allgood and Walstad also support this observation of no significant gender differences in learning economics. However, Walstad and Soper found a significant difference in learning rates between males and females, and this observation was replicated in a subsequent study by Becker and Walstad."
" While academic research has addressed the influence of several factors on test scores, such as socioeconomic status and gender, the effect of race and ethnicity has received relatively less attention. Nevertheless, some studies have aimed to examine this issue. For example, Evans [1992] investigated the impact of race and ethnicity on test scores, and found that black students tend to score significantly lower than white students, whereas Hispanics performed similarly to whites. In contrast, Harris and Kerby [1997] found that both black and Hispanic students were at a disadvantage compared to white students, while Asian students tended to perform higher than whites, although the difference was not significant. Similarly, Walstad and Soper [1989] discovered that black students exhibited poorer performance on the TEL relative to other students. Furthermore, the National Center for Education Statistics published results in 2007 of the first national assessment of economic literacy in grade 12, revealing a higher percentage of black and Hispanic students scored below the basic level compared to their white counterparts."," Although research has explored the relationship between various factors and test scores, such as socioeconomic status and sex, less attention has been paid to the connection between race and ethnicity and test performance. Some studies have sought to investigate this issue, though. For instance, Evans [1992] conducted a study on race and ethnicity's influence on test scores, where he discovered black students scored significantly lower than white students and Hispanics typically scored similarly to white students. However, Harris and Kerby's [1997] research found that both black and Hispanic students were at a disadvantage compared to white students, with Filipino students scoring similarly to black students. In contrast, Asian students scored higher than white students, with no significant difference found in the scores. In addition, Walstad and Soper [1989] found black students tended to perform poorly than other students when completing the TEL assessments.

Hispanics, in contrast, usually performed at a similar level to whites. Harris and Kerby [1997] found that black and Hispanic students were disadvantaged compared to white students, while Filipino students had lower test scores than whites. Asian students generally performed better than white students, with no significant difference in scores found. Additionally, Walstad and Soper [1989] discovered that African American students performed worse than other students when taking the TEL.

" In order to assess the performance of students on the TEL examination, it was crucial to acquire information on various characteristics of the students. To acquire this information, we designed a student questionnaire, Appendix A, along with gathering data from official school records. The demographic data collected included race, ethnicity, and gender, as well as educational background and working preferences of the parents, primary language of the student, hours they work outside of school, and hours dedicated to studies. The official school records provided us with academic data such as the students' GPAs (excluding physical education) prior to the Fall 2005 semester, and mathematical and reading scores from some schools. The students took the pretest before the start of their economics course, as they had no prior formal training in economics. Our survey instrument was administered during the first two weeks of classes to all participating students."," To examine the performance of students on the TEL exam, a comprehensive understanding of the students' characteristics was necessary.

In other words, we are keen to understand how these variables contribute to the value-added from economics instruction."," By including both pretest scores and student characteristics that determine pretest scores in the post-test regression, we can analyze the coefficients for the student characteristics to determine their marginal impacts on the post-test scores. These impacts are analyzed separately from their effects on pretest scores. The purpose of this analysis is to determine how student characteristics affect the value-added from economics instruction."," In order to better understand the effects of student characteristics on post-test scores, researchers have accounted for pretest scores in the post-test regression analysis. This allows for the coefficients for student characteristics to represent the marginal impacts of these variables on the post-test scores, while holding constant their effects on pretest scores. The goal of this analysis is to assess how certain student characteristics contribute to the value-added from economics instruction."
" The second table contains relevant information about pretest scores and the developments occurred in test scores pertaining to various criteria. The data is classified according to different factors such as race and ethnicity, gender, and academic performance. The statistical data in the first two rows of the table showcases the sample means for pretest scores and the difference amidst the pretest and post-test scores, mainly listed by race and ethnicity. However, it is good to note that African-American students are not represented in this information due to the lack of adequate observation. Moreover, adjoining rows such as row three and four, and row five and six, analyze data regarding gender and whether students have taken any honors or advanced placement courses. Each category's statistical significance probability test is displayed within the table."," The data in Table 2 reports on the pretest scores and changes made in test scores arranged by race, ethnicity, gender, and academic performance. The initial two rows show the means of students' pretest scores and the alterations between pretest and post-test scores. However, the data does not include the scores for African-American students since the number of observations collected for this group was inadequate. Rows three and four, and rows five and six provide the same details but are sorted by gender and whether students had experience with advanced placement or honors courses. Probability values for univariate tests of importance are stated for each subgroup in the table."," In Table 2, data is presented on the pretest scores and the changes that occurred in test scores divided by race, ethnicity, gender, and academic performance. The first two rows show the mean of the pretest scores and the difference between the pretest and post-test scores. African-American students are not included in this data as there were not enough observations conducted to make this comparison. Rows three and four, and rows five and six provide the same information, separated by gender and whether or not the students had honours or advanced placement experience. The table presents probability values to demonstrate the significance levels of tests for each subgroup."
" According to the information presented in Table 2, there are slight yet significant differences in pretest scores between male and female students. On average, male students outperform female counterparts by approximately 3.5 percent. In the absence of economic education, Walstad and Rebeck [2001b] discovered a gender gap of 4 percent that favors male students. Moreover, students who have completed at least one advanced placement or honors class have scored higher on the TEL compared to those who haven't. These findings are in line with similar research from Evans [1992] and Walstad and Rebeck [2001a, b]."," Table 2 highlights the existence of significant yet minor differences between pretest scores of male and female students. On average, male students score about 3.5 percent higher than female students. Without formal economic education, Walstad and Rebeck [2001b] found a 4 percent gender gap in favor of male students. Moreover, students who took at least one advanced placement or honors class performed better on the TEL than those who did not. Similar outcomes are reported in studies by Evans [1992] and Walstad and Rebeck [2001a, b]."," When looking at Table 2, it becomes evident that there are some notable gender differences in pretest scores, despite being minor. On average, male students outscore female students by roughly 3.5 percentage points. According to Walstad and Rebeck [2001b], students who don't have a formal economic education tend to have a gender gap favoring males by 4 percentage points. Furthermore, there is evidence that students who completed at least one advanced placement or honors class had better TEL scores than those who had not. Similar results can be found in Evans [1992] and Walstad and Rebeck [2001a, b]'s research."
" The pretest scores for Hispanic and Asian pupils are found to be significantly lower than white pupils in Column 1 of Table 3, which agrees with the univariate tests in Table 2. However, when adjusting for family background, performance, and work effort, the gap shrinks from around 11 percentage points in Table 2 to 7 percentage points in Table 3. These results suggest that disparities in academic achievement between Hispanic and white students may be partly due to differences in factors such as family background and efforts at work. The study's findings reveal a substantial negative impact on African American pupils, with 11.12 percentage points, but the sample sizes for these groups were small, so caution is advised when interpreting the results for those groups."," Examining the pretest scores from Column 1 of Table 3, it is clear that there is a considerable performance gap between Hispanic and Asian students compared to white students. The findings are consistent with the previous univariate tests presented in Table 2. However, the multiple regression analysis shows that the white-Hispanic gap in scores reduces from 11 percentage points to 7 percentage points. This suggests that the observed differences in academic performance between Hispanic and white students cannot entirely be attributed to race. Factors such as family background, performance, and work ethic may also affect academic achievement. While African-American students exhibit negative effects of 11.12 percentage points, caution is necessary interpreting these findings due to the relatively small sample size."," In Column 1 of Table 3, it is clear that the pretest scores of Hispanic and Asian pupils are significantly lower than those of white students, which is consistent with Table 2's results. However, when taking into account family background, performance, and work effort characteristics, the white-Hispanic gap in scores falls from approximately 11 percentage points to about 7 percentage points. This suggests that factors other than race may be responsible for the performance gap between these groups. The study's results found a significant negative effect of 11.12 percentage points on African-American pupils, but due to sample size limitations, it is unclear if this effect size is representative of this entire population."
" The figures displayed in Table 3 present an alternative perspective on gender differences. In particular, Column 1 indicates that males are more successful by 6.4 percentage points, which is higher (by 83 percent) than the gender distinction previously identified in Table 2. One possible explanation for this outcome is that males underperform when compared to females on academic indicators; nevertheless, they surpass females on the TEL assessment. As a result, the male-to-female variation in examination scores expands when academic performance measures are taken into account."," The gender impacts described in Table 3 represent a contrasting view. As seen in Column 1, males enjoy a 6.4 percent advantage that favours them, an 83 percent rise from the gender differential disclosed in Table 2. The likely reason for this result could be that males' academic performance lags behind females', yet they perform much better than females on the TEL. Consequently, adjusting for academic performance characteristics expands the gap between male and female performance in the examination."," Table 3 presents distinct gender impacts. Column 1 indicates that men have a 6.4 percent edge, 83 percent more substantial than the gender contrast in Table 2. The male advantage may be due to lower academic performance, yet they have stronger TEL scores. Consequently, accounting for academic performance features may widen the gender gap in examination results."
" The data additionally point out that students who claim English as their primary language for both writing and speaking tend to receive higher scores on the pretest, approximately 5 percentage points more than those students who don't. Furthermore, pupils who live with both parents also tend to score higher by around 3 percentage points. Academic GPA is an important indicator of pretest success, and each increase by one point is associated with an almost 9.12 percentage point upturn in pretest scores. Apart from this, students participating in an advanced placement economics class tend to score approximately 4 percentage points higher on the pretest. The variable which verifies if the students ever had an advanced placement, or honors class is trivial in the pretest regressions."," It has been observed that there is a correlation between students who list English as their primary language for writing and speaking and their pretest scores, with an approximate increase of 5 percentage points for these students compared to others. Similarly, students who live with both parents tend to score approximately 3 percentage points higher. Academic performance is found to be significantly linked to pretest success, with a one-point hike in academic GPA resulting in an approximately 9.12 percentage point rise in pretest scores. Furthermore, students undertaking advanced placement economics courses are likely to score almost 4 percentage points higher on the pretest. Notably, the factor determining whether students have previously taken advanced placement or honors courses is insignificant in the pretest regression analysis."," Results have suggested that students who mention English as their main language for writing and speaking may have an edge in pretest scores, with an approximate increase of 5 percentage points compared to those who don't. Similarly, individuals living with both parents can achieve scores that are around 3 percentage points higher. It is evident that academic performance plays a crucial role in predicting success on the pretest, where a one-point increase in academic GPA leads to an expected rise of 9.12 percentage points in pretest scores. Moreover, students who choose to take advanced placement economics classes may score almost 4 percentage points higher on the pretest. However, the variable examining whether students have ever taken advanced placement or honors classes holds no significance in the pretest regression analysis."
" Upon analyzing the pretest results, it was observed that the addition of math and reading scores (in Table 3, Column 2) made little difference to the estimated effects of gender and ethnicity as previously reported in Column 1. An incline in reading scores by ten points leads to an increase of just over 4 percentage points in pretest scores. The inclusion of mathematics and reading scores, however, reduces the impact of academic GPA from 9.12 percentage points to 7.42 percentage points. On the other hand, the effect of being presently enrolled in advanced placement economics is found to have increased from 3.88 percentage points to 5.78 percentage points."," The introduction of math and reading scores into the pretest regression analysis (Table 3, Column 2) was found to have a negligible impact on the estimated gender and ethnicity effects previously reported in Column 1. The results indicated that a ten-point increase in reading scores resulted in a minimal increase of slightly over 4 percentage points in pretest scores. When math and reading scores were considered, it was discovered that the effect of academic GPA reduced from 9.12 percentage points to 7.42 percentage points. However, the analysis established that the effect of being currently enrolled in advanced placement economics increased from 3.88 percentage points to 5.78 percentage points."," The notion of incorporating math and reading scores into the pretest regression analysis (Table 3, Column 2) had little bearing on the estimated ethnicity and gender effects reported in Column 1. A marginal increase of just over 4 percent was noticed in pretest scores when reading scores were raised by ten points. Including math and reading scores, however, diminished the impact of academic GPA from 9.12 percentage points to 7.42 percentage points. Unexpectedly, the impact of currently being enrolled in advanced placement economics rose from 3.88 percentage points to 5.78 percentage points after the introduction of math and reading scores in the analysis."
" The outcomes of our investigation affirm the findings of previous investigations about the determinants of high school students' stock of economic knowledge. As mentioned in the literature review, multiple studies have indicated that males tend to perform better than females with statistically significant differences, whereas our gender effects are even more prominent than in previous studies, with the exception of Heath's report. Academic ability has also been identified as a contributing factor to economic knowledge, with studies indicating that variables like GPA and enrollment in AP courses have a significant impact on students' scores. Other research has also found that factors like grade level, GPA, and employment status are significant predictors of students' marks. Moreover, ethnicity has demonstrated to be a crucial component, with Hispanic and Filipino students scoring notably lower than white students on multiple choice exams. Our study focused on a specific county, and it appears that ethnicity and gender differences are even more significant than previous studies, but our study's results for Hispanic students may be influenced by Orange County-specific factors."," Our research upholds prior research regarding the factors that affect high school students' economic knowledge. As stated in the literature review, several studies have revealed that males show statistically significant differences in performance over females. Our research exhibits more substantial gender effects than most previous studies, with the exception of Heath. Academic ability has also been proven to be an essential contributor to the acquisition of economic knowledge. GPA, enrollment in AP courses, and other variables have been shown to have a profound impact on students' levels of knowledge. Additional studies have found an association between variables such as grade level, GPA, and part-time employment status, and students' overall scores. In addition, ethnicity is a major element with Hispanic and Filipino students earning lower scores on multiple choice exams than white students. While our study was limited to a single county, the data suggests even stronger ethnicity and gender disparities in the pretest scores than previous studies, although we must not ignore the possibility that our results for Hispanic students are influenced by Orange County-specific factors."," Our findings validate former research on high school students' economic knowledge determinants. As outlined in the literature review, males have consistently performed better than females, with statistically significant gender differences, and our study shows more significant gender effects except for Heath's research. Academic ability has also been revealed as a vital factor for economic knowledge, where GPA and enrollment in AP courses can positively influence students' scores. Furthermore, previous studies have indicated that a student's grade level, GPA, and part-time job status are other relevant factors contributing to students' economic knowledge. Ethnicity is also an essential component, with Hispanic and Filipino students obtaining lower scores than their white peers. Although we focused on one county, our dataset suggests more prominent ethnicity and gender imbalances in pretest scores than most prior research; however, this is especially evident in the results of Hispanic pupils, which may not be generalizable to other geographic areas."
" The data collected from high school students in our sample revealed that their initial understanding of economics is not particularly robust. The results from descriptive statistics indicated that the pretest TEL scores were highest among white students (55.5%), followed by Asians (48.9%), while Hispanics (44.1%) achieved the lowest scores. Males exhibited better performance than females (54.8% and 51.3%, respectively), showing a difference of around 3.5 percentage points. When analyzing the factors influencing pretest scores, ethnicity and gender played significant roles, and it was discovered that the gap between Hispanic and white students' pretest scores reduced but was still present even after academic performance and family background characteristics were controlled."," The initial knowledge of economics among high school students in the sample appeared to be lacking based on the collected data.

Moreover, male students displayed better performance than females by approximately 3.5 percentage points (54.8% and 51.3%, respectively). When evaluating the factors that influenced the pretest scores, ethnicity and gender appeared to have a significant role. Academic performance and family background characteristics reduced the gap between Hispanic and white students' pretest scores, although it continued to be present."
" The pretest scores demonstrate intriguing gender differences. Although males have a marginal upper hand in economic literacy, the gap expands significantly when taking academic performance factors into account. Women do not exhibit their potential in economics as they do in other subjects. One could hypothesize that providing young girls with much early exposure to economic reasoning could improve their performance. In general, pretest scores are significantly influenced by academic achievement, such as GPA and standardized reading and mathematics scores."," It is quite interesting to note the pretest score gender differences. Male respondents demonstrate a slightly higher initial economic literacy, but this margin widens substantially once adjusted for academic performance characteristics. In comparison to other subjects, women's economic performance seems to be underwhelming. This suggests a possible intervention of introducing economic reasoning at an earlier age for young girls. Notably, pretest scores are heavily impacted by academic performance indicators such as GPA, standardized mathematics, and reading scores."," The gender disparities spotted in the pretest scores are quite intriguing. Men tend to exhibit a slight advantage in initial economic literacy, but the gap becomes more significant when taking academic performance factors into account. Women's performance in economics seems to be underwhelming compared to their performance in other academic subjects. A plausible explanation for the underachievement could be the lack of early exposure to economic thinking among young girls. Pretest scores are significantly influenced by academic achievements such as standardized mathematics and reading scores, as well as GPA."
" According to our findings, teacher quality appears to have a major influence on students' educational attainment. We have noticed that the effects of individual teachers are mostly significant and substantial. While there may be shared student characteristics within a classroom that produce peer effects, we maintain that the teacher's expertise plays an integral part in shaping improvements in their pupils' test scores."," Our research suggests that teacher quality can have a considerable impact on students' learning outcomes. We have observed that the effects of teachers on their students are generally significant and statistically meaningful. Although there may be unknown student characteristics or observable factors that contribute to peer influence, we firmly believe that the quality of teaching is a critical factor in improving students' test scores."," Our study indicates that the quality of a teacher can make a significant difference in a student's academic growth. The teacher-specific effects are quite substantial and statistically significant. While there may be unidentified factors among the students from the same classroom that produce peer effects, we assert that teacher quality plays a substantial role in determining changes in the students' test scores."
" The findings reveal promising areas for policy intervention based on ethnicity and gender. It is evident that Hispanic students' economic literacy can be improved by addressing the factors affecting their overall academic performance in relation to white students. Thus, the focus should primarily be on enhancing their learning opportunities across all subjects, including economics, starting from an early age. Our results also suggest an underlying discrepancy in the exposure of economic concepts between Hispanic and white students, possibly due to income and community characteristics. Furthermore, female students' economic knowledge is lagging behind that of male students despite similar overall academic performance, indicating the need to address gender disparities in economic education."," Strategies to improve economic literacy can be better targeted by considering the role of ethnicity and gender. The study indicates that ways to enhance the overall academic performance of Hispanic students in comparison to white students hold the key to boosting Hispanic economic literacy. To achieve this, it is important to increase learning opportunities in various subjects, including economics, beginning early on in the school years. The disparities in pretest scores for Hispanic and White students, even after controlling for academic performance characteristics, suggest that economic concepts might be introduced differently in these two groups, probably tied to income, and other background factors. The study also found female students have lower economic knowledge than their male peers, which demonstrates the need to address the gender divide in economic education."," Our research findings suggest that policy intervention to improve economic literacy must consider ethnicity and gender. One of the main takeaways is that Hispanic students' economic literacy is closely linked to their overall academic performance compared to white students. To enhance Hispanics' economic literacy, policymakers should prioritize upping their learning opportunities in all subjects, including economics. The differences in pretest scores between white and Hispanic students, even after accounting for academic performance characteristics, could suggest unequal exposure to economic concepts, partly attributable to income and environmental factors. The study also revealed a gender disparity in 12th-grade economic knowledge, with female students being less informed than their male counterparts despite similar overall academic performance. Thus, attention must also be given to bridging the gender gap in economic education."
" Based on our evaluation of the economic knowledge among 12th graders, we have come to the conclusion that there is a need for more emphasis on basic economic literacy in the K-11 school curriculum. Although our study has limited geographical scope, it is evident that there is a need for a systemic approach to cultivate economic literacy among students. It is noteworthy that the California History/Social Science Standards have addressed economic concepts and ways of thinking through an Economics Strand throughout the K-12 curriculum. However, despite the 'infusion' approach, we found that young Californians' economic literacy upon entering the 12th grade was not up to the mark. On the other hand, we observed that formal economic instruction in the 12th grade led to an improvement in students' economic literacy."," Our analysis of the economic knowledge of 12th graders indicates the need for greater emphasis on economic literacy throughout the K-11 curriculum. Although our study was geographically limited, it highlights the need for a systematic approach to foster economic understanding among students. Since 1998, the California History/Social Science Standards have required the infusion of basic economic concepts and ways of thinking throughout the K-12 curriculum. However, despite these requirements, we found that young Californians' economic literacy upon entering 12th grade was weak. Despite this, we found that the provision of formal economic instruction in the 12th grade led to improved economic literacy among students."," Our examination of the economic literacy of 12th graders suggests that there is a need to invest more in basic economic education throughout the K-11 curriculum. Although our study has a limited geographical scope, it highlights the importance of incorporating economic concepts and ways of thinking into all stages of education. The California History/Social Science Standards have included an Economics Strand in the K-12 curriculum since 1998, requiring the inclusion of basic economic principles over an 11-year period, culminating in a one-semester economics course in high school. Nevertheless, we discovered that young Californians' economic knowledge was insufficient when starting the 12th grade, despite the 'infusion' approach. However, we found that 12th grade economic instruction had a positive impact on students' economic literacy."
" Classical economists placed a significant emphasis on the accumulation of capital and growth, a tradition that began with the publication of Adam Smith's book, The Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Throughout his work, Smith offered a highly structured explanation of economic development in which an array of economic forces interacted to push commercial economies forward in a dynamic process. This focus on growth and the accumulation of wealth would remain a cornerstone of classical economic theory, shaping the way economists approached questions of economic policy and development for centuries to come."," The issues of capital accumulation and growth were of utmost importance to classical economists. This emphasis dates back to Adam Smith's seminal work, The Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, which provided a highly formal account of economic development. Smith argued that economic forces interacted in a complex manner and drove commercial economies forward in an ever-evolving dynamic process. As a result, the pursuit of growth and accumulation became a central pillar of classical economic theory, influencing the way economists approached questions of economic policy and development for generations to come."," One of the core ideals held by classical economists was the importance of capital accumulation and growth. This principle can be distinctly traced back to Adam Smith's seminal work, The Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. In this work, Smith provided a highly formal account of economic development, where various economic forces interacted and led commercial economies to move forward in a dynamic process. This emphasis on growth and accumulation would continue to be a significant foundation of classical economic theory, influencing economic policies for years to come."
" However, the topic of economic evolution is not straightforward and involves various other aspects. Besides looking at economics, we also need to consider the effect of politics and culture on the development of society. Smith believed that historical inquiry aids in constructing a social science framework that takes into account these critical factors. In Book III of the Wealth of Nations, Smith also presents a historical account of the rise and fall of feudal systems, which led to modern European states' formation. The study of history, therefore, is a fundamental component in understanding the economic development and advancement of human society."," To understand economic evolution thoroughly, we cannot limit ourselves to only economics or history. We must also examine how technology and innovation have transformed society throughout time. Smith acknowledged that the study of history is a crucial tool to help us create a coherent social science system. In doing so, we can better understand how technology, politics, and culture have contributed to the economic development of civilizations. The Wealth of Nations' third book describes the rise and fall of societies in Europe before it reached its current state. Therefore, the study of history and technological advancements are essential to understanding economic evolution's complexity."," The issue of economic evolution is multifaceted, and cannot be understood by looking at economics or history in isolation. We must also consider how social and cultural factors play a role in shaping economic structures. As Smith observed, studying history is an essential tool that helps us understand how society has developed over time, and how it has impacted the economy. This understanding helps us build a more comprehensive social science framework that can account for the many complex factors that shape the economic evolution of societies. In the Wealth of Nations, Smith recounts the progress of civilization from feudalism to modern Europe, providing a historical perspective on how this evolution has occurred. Therefore, the study of history and the cultural context in which it has been written are essential to comprehending economic evolution's complexity."
" Smith's essay on the history of astronomy highlights that science seeks to identify the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the regularity of events and phenomena. Scientists strive to uncover the ""connecting principles of nature"" and the ""invisible chains"" that bring together apparently disjointed objects, as Smith puts it. Similarly, moral philosophy aims to investigate and explain these connecting principles. According to the Wealth of Nations, moral philosophy is a ""science"" that focuses on understanding and explaining these principles. Smith endeavored to unearth the chains and mechanisms that reveal the connecting principles and how they could be used to understand social events. Today, Smith's moral philosophy covers natural theology, ethics, jurisprudence, and economics and is often viewed as a social science system."," In his essay on the history of astronomy, Smith argues that science seeks to identify the underlying mechanisms that give rise to the regularity of events and phenomena.

" Some commentators have argued that Smith's historical account should be seen as more of an idiographic approach, emphasizing the specific details of past events and focusing less on a predetermined theoretical framework. In this view, history is seen as a collection of unique narratives rather than a systematic examination of recurring themes. While Smith did utilize historical evidence to support his theories, it was not seen as the main focus of his approach, which remained oriented towards understanding the broader patterns and structures underlying historical events. Ultimately, the debate over what approach Smith took to history speaks to larger questions about the nature and purpose of historical inquiry as a whole."," Some scholars have offered a different interpretation of Smith's historical account, suggesting that it can be seen as a hybrid approach that combines both idiographic and nomothetic elements. This view emphasizes the importance of both specific details and broader patterns in historical analysis, recognizing that both perspectives can offer valuable insights into the complexities of historical events. Furthermore, this approach highlights the need to engage in an ongoing dialogue between theory and evidence, with each informing and enriching the other. Overall, this more nuanced view of Smith's historical approach emphasizes the importance of flexibility and openness in historical inquiry, recognizing that there are many different ways of approaching and understanding the complex realities of the past."," Smith's historical approach has been subject to much debate, with various scholars offering different interpretations of his work. One prominent view considers Smith's approach to be primarily nomothetic in nature, emphasizing the importance of developing a theoretical framework to understand and analyze historical events. Another perspective sees Smith's approach as being more idiographic, prioritizing the collection and arrangement of specific details to create a narrative account of the past. However, rather than viewing these approaches as mutually exclusive, some scholars have sought to reconcile them by emphasizing the need to strike a balance between theory and evidence. This approach recognizes that while theory can provide a valuable framework for understanding historical events, it must also be grounded in the specific details of those events to be truly effective. Ultimately, the ongoing debate over Smith's historical approach highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of historical inquiry and the need for historians to be flexible and adaptable in their methods."
" Smith's discussion of the European economic development has been of great interest to scholars as he stated that the true course of events was ""entirely inverted."" This prompted Smith to explore the reasons for this divergence in detail, dedicating several chapters of Book III to the inquiry. Nonetheless, some commentators have argued that Smith's theory failed to account for the role of historical experience in shaping the economic trajectory."," The European economic development discourse in Smith's work has piqued scholars' interest due to his striking claim that the actual course of events was completely reversed. This prompted Smith to dedicate an extensive portion of Book III to the exploration of the reasons behind this divergence. Despite this, some commentators have critiqued Smith's theory, arguing that it failed to reconcile with historical experience and the impact of such experiences on the economic trajectory."," Scholars have been fascinated by Smith's depiction of the development of the European economy, particularly his remarkable claim that the real course of events was entirely inverted. As a result of this, Smith devoted several chapters of Book III to analyzing why this divergence occurred. However, some critics question Smith's ability to reconcile historical experiences with his theoretical explanation, suggesting his argument falls short in reconciling the two."
" For the current objective, it is essential to mention that the theoretical advancement demonstrated in the primary chapter of Book III is established on a type of economic theoretical representation that incorporates various institutional, legal, and political factors, either given or assumed as constant."," It is crucial to acknowledge that the theoretical history of progress presented in the initial chapter of Book III is constructed on an economic theoretical modeling that considers various institutional, legal, and political components either as unchanging factors or given as constants. This modeling is indicative of the idea that economic progression is dependent upon a set of circumstances that are reliant upon consistent or predictable governing conditions."," In order to achieve the current objective, it is important to note that the theoretical framework of progress described in the first chapter of Book III is based on an economic model that incorporates several institutional, legal, and political factors which are either assumed constant or given. This model implies that economic advancement is reliant on a certain set of conditions that are predicated on a stable governing environment."
" Smith's historical analysis of economic progress goes beyond the traditional focus on economic modeling, and instead includes the incorporation of politico-economic modeling. In this view, he considers the interplay between economic forces and political structures, such as the structure of legal rules and incentives at the level of the polity. This expanded understanding of the drivers of economic change is explored throughout Book III and Book IV of the Wealth of Nations, although it may not immediately be apparent within his presentation of the theory of economic progress. Through integrating political and economic modeling, Smith's theoretical history of economic progress takes on a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to understanding the mechanisms of economic change."," Smith's analysis of economic progress takes a multidimensional approach, highlighting the importance of recognizing the interplay between politico-economic structures and economic forces. By incorporating politico-economic modeling alongside traditional economic modeling, Smith is able to more comprehensively understand the drivers of economic change. Throughout Book III and Book IV of the Wealth of Nations, he explores these relationships in detail, examining the function and impact of legal rules and incentives within a broader context. Although this expanded view of economic progress may not initially be apparent, it presents a more nuanced understanding of the complex systems that drive economic change. Through this multidimensional approach, Smith's work provides important insights that remain relevant today."," Smith's analysis of economic progress transcends traditional economic modeling by introducing politico-economic modeling. In this approach, he posits that it's essential to acknowledge the interrelationship between economic structures and political structures like legal frameworks and monetary incentives. He supports this theory through Book III and Book IV of the Wealth of Nations. While Smith's narrative of the theoretical history of economic change does not seem evident right away, it uncovers the complex systems and provides a detailed comprehension of what drives economic progression. By incorporating politico-economic structures, Smith's theory provides a comprehensive view of the mechanisms of economic change that still holds vital significance to this day."
" Smith's perspective on political economy diverges from the conventional view that regards it as a field limited to economic matters. In his view, political economy was an essential aspect of the statesman or legislator's science, and he referred to it as the theory of the state. He also emphasized the role of natural jurisprudence as a foundation of the laws of nations, which he believed was a vital part of the theory of the state. In essence, Smith's political economy was an interdisciplinary subject that explored the interplay between politics and economics."," Smith's understanding of political economy deviated from the traditional notion of an isolated discipline focused solely on economic principles. Instead, he regarded it as a subdivision of the statesman or legislator's science, which he referred to as the theory of the state. Furthermore, Smith recognized the significance of natural jurisprudence as the fundamental principles underlying national legislation. This natural jurisprudence was characterized as a theory that propounds the general principles on which the laws of nations should be based. In sum, Smith's political economy was not just an economic subject, but a comprehensive field that evaluated the interdependence between economics and politics."," In Smith's view, political economy's scope went beyond pure economic concepts, in contrast to conventional economic perspectives that restricted their analysis to economic matters only. Rather, Smith regarded political economy as a subdivision of the statesman's or legislator's field of expertise, which he referred to as the theory of the state. Alongside this, Smith highlighted natural jurisprudence's importance, a legal philosophy that proposed fundamental principles that should guide national laws. According to Smith, natural jurisprudence was necessary to serve as the foundation for the laws of nations. As a result, his conception of political economy was holistic and interdisciplinary, concentrating on the connection between economic and political activities."
" The analysis implies that Smith may have a unique politico-economic model that incorporates his theories of the state and positive economics as sub-constructs. Smith's historical account of Europe's progress illustrates how the interplay between politics and the economy is essential, and any governmental measures or legal structures put in place by public policy will impact the economic environment, whether positively or negatively."," After examining the evidence, it seems that Smith could have formulated a distinctive politico-economic model in economic history by incorporating his ideas of the state and positive economics as subtheories. As per Smith's account of Europe's progress, the politico-economic model suggests that the interaction between the polity and the economy is critical, and any governmental actions or legal institutions established through public policy will have an impact on economic growth, whether beneficial or detrimental."," Smith appears to have developed an exclusive politico-economic model in economic history that integrates his theories of the state and positive economics as subtheories. Based on Smith's historical narrative of Europe's progress, the politico-economic model acknowledges that politics and the economy are interdependent, and any government activities or legal institutions established through public policy will inevitably affect the economic performance, positively or negatively."
" It is essential to note that Smith had a profound understanding that numerous elements were involved in determining the advancement or regression of wealth in the real world. He frequently emphasized that defense, climate, culture, terrain, and chance were among the factors that affected economic performance and social change. Hence, it is crucial to consider these varying factors to comprehend the complex relationships between economic growth and other societal aspects."," One of the critical insights offered by Smith is his recognition that economic growth and social progress are highly dependent on a range of diverse and often interconnected factors. He notes that defense capabilities, cultural practices, climatic conditions, geographical terrain, and the random events of chance can significantly impact economic outcomes and drive changes in societies. Thus, Smith's analysis highlights the importance of considering a broad spectrum of contextual elements to comprehensively comprehend the complex dynamics of economic development and social change."," Smith's astute observations indicate that wealth stagnation or progress is not merely driven by economic factors, but also by an array of external forces that shape societal change. His acknowledgment that defense, culture, climate, terrain, and chance have a combined feeble effect that can influence economic performance and social development is noteworthy. It implies that for a complete understanding of economic growth and social transformation, careful consideration ought to be given to the interplay between diverse factors. As a result, Smith emphasized that taking into account the entire range of factors at play is necessary."
" The desire to attain a higher standard of living is an essential aspect of human nature that begins at birth and never extinguishes until death, according to Smith's 1776 literature. This innate urge is what fuels people to save and invest, leading to macro-level capital accumulation and ultimately higher employment rates and a stronger economy. This theory emphasizes the importance of individual initiative in driving economic growth and development."," Smith's 1776 book highlights the crucial aspect of self-interest or the 'desire to better one's condition' as intrinsic to human nature. This desire perpetuates from birth throughout our entire lives, driving us to save and invest our resources. The implications of this principle are profound, with capital accumulation at the macro-level leading to larger national incomes, increased employment, and economic growth. Ultimately, the pursuit of self-interest and financial gain is essential to progress as individuals and as a society."," Smith posits that human nature is driven by the principle of self-love, a desire to improve one's lot in life that is founded in our very beings and sustains throughout our lives. This basic human drive is what motivates people to save and create capital, leading to significant economic growth and higher national incomes. Smith's theory emphasizes the significance of individual achievement and initiative in shaping the direction of a society's economic advancement. In summary, the desire for self-improvement and financial betterment is a crucial component of human society and a driving force behind economic progress."
" An important aspect of Smith's economic account is the consideration of institutional factors, including political and legal frameworks for property rights and contracts, which are governed by the state. Such institutions impose formal limitations on individual behavior and, therefore, play a crucial role in human interaction. Properly structured institutions, such as a fair and just system of property rights and governance, can provide individuals with secure conditions for productive activity and encourage the pursuit of economic gain. Ultimately, such incentives can lead to a more efficient allocation of scarce resources."," Smith's economic history approach incorporates an assessment of institutional factors such as political rules, contracts, and property rights, which are established and maintained by state systems. These human institutions serve as rigid boundaries in day-to-day life and act as a primary medium for human interaction. Fundamental structural components, such as the type of governance and property rights arrangements, can encourage individuals to participate in economic activities and promote a more effective use of limited resources. By creating a secure and sound environment for industry, institutional factors can generate significant incentives for economic growth and strengthen economic development."," Smith's economic history framework considers institutional elements, including political policies, contractual mechanisms, and property rights frameworks that are shaped and administered by governmental regimes. These institutions establish formal boundaries that guide and constrain everyday human interactions. A well-designed configuration of state institutions, such as a well-functioning governance system and property rights structure, can create stable conditions for private enterprise and encourage economic activity. This, in turn, boosts productivity and ensures more effective utilization of society's limited resources. By generating a secure environment for industry, institutional factors can improve the overall economic performance and growth of a society."
" ""In the section starting from Book III, Chapter 2 of the Wealth of Nations, Smith analyzes the advancement of prosperity and the change to the modern economy, which occurred in Europe after the collapse of the Roman Empire.

As such, Smith's account of history is centered on the evolution of agriculture, which played a significant role in shaping the rise of modern economies."""
" The main objective of this study is to evaluate the role of institutional environment in shaping economic growth and development internationally. To address this research question, a novel method based on the institutions-augmented Solow model is utilized, and empirical regression equations are estimated. Data from a 20-year period spanning 180 countries are analyzed in this study. The findings indicate that the quality of institutional environments has a significant positive influence on economic development, as demonstrated by all five institutional indicators: two indices of economic freedom, the governance indicator, the democracy index, and the EBRD transition indicator for post-socialist countries. According to the results, differences in human and physical capital and institutional environment account for a significant proportion of global variations in economic development.

" The speed of economic growth and the extent of economic development depend on various factors, including both theoretical and empirical paradigms. Using a classification method, these factors can be classified into two broad groups: demand-side and supply-side determinants. The demand-side determinants include investment expenditures, government spending on goods and services, and net exports, while the supply-side determinants include physical capital, human capital, labor, and technology, which affect potential output. Both the demand-side and supply-side determinants can be further subdivided into many more types, such as various types of investments, government spending, or capital. The direct determinants are the factors that turn inputs or expenditures into output."," Economic growth and development are influenced by several factors, considering both theoretical and empirical standpoints. These factors can be classified into two primary categories: demand-side and supply-side determinants. Components of aggregate demand including investment expenditures, government spending on goods and services, and net exports are considered demand-side determinants. In contrast, the supply-side determinants that influence potential output are physical capital, human capital, labor, and technology. The demand-side and supply-side determinants can be further subdivided according to their particular characteristics, such as different kinds of investments, government spending, or capital. These factors of influence transform inputs or expenditures into output and are referred to as the direct determinants."," The pace of economic growth and the degree of economic development are subject to multiple influences, including theoretical and empirical perspectives. These factors can be categorized into two groups: demand-side and supply-side determinants. The demand-side determinants comprise investment expenditures, government spending on goods and services, and net exports, while the supply-side determinants affect potential output and include physical capital, human capital, labor, and technology. These categories can both be further broken down into unique subgroups, such as different types of capital, various forms of government spending, or specific investments. Direct determinants are named so because they immediately transform inputs or expenditures into output, and these direct factors can be found in both the demand-side and supply-side determinants."
" Economic growth and development are two separate processes that are dependent on various factors. Although direct determinants are crucial in this regard, they do not always ensure sustainable growth. Deep factors of production are also essential components of both economic growth and development. Deep determinants, which encompass institutions that allow for interactions between output and measurable inputs, play a vital role in determining the macroeconomic performance. These institutions facilitate economic activities and provide stable conditions that enable firms to carry out their commercial operations efficiently. Additionally, social factors, including education, labor markets, and cultural norms, also contribute significantly to sustainable growth and development."," Direct determinants and deep factors of production both have an impact on economic growth and development. However, deep factors of production, which include institutions such as legal systems and property rights, have a more profound influence on economic performance. These institutions provide a framework for economic activities to take place and support the growth of different sectors of the economy. Deep determinants of development also include human capital, social capital, and technological advancements, which play a crucial role in economic growth. Additionally, institutions that provide social safety nets and ensure equal opportunities for all citizens are critical for sustainable economic development. Governments and policymakers play a crucial role in developing and implementing these deep determinants to support economic growth and development."," Economic growth and development are complex processes that depend on various factors, both direct and indirect. Direct determinants such as physical and human capital are necessary for economic growth but are not sufficient for sustainable development. Deep determinants of development such as good governance, strong institutions, and societal norms play an essential role in creating a conducive environment for economic activity to thrive. They also help reduce transaction costs and lower barriers to entry, creating more opportunities for businesses and entrepreneurs to grow. Additionally, the presence of a vibrant education system and a skilled workforce are crucial for attracting foreign investments and support economic growth. Therefore, policymakers should focus on developing deep determinants that support and drive economic growth and development in the long run."
" The impact of institutions on economic growth and development cannot be understated. However, there are several challenges associated with evaluating institutions' effect on economic growth. Firstly, determining the institutions that provide the most significant contribution to growth, and secondly, quantifying institutions in a way that can be used for empirical research. As a result, there is still much room for further exploration of the relationship between institutions and economic growth through both theoretical and empirical studies."," Institutions play a critical role in the process of both economic growth and development. However, assessing the precise impact of these institutions on economic growth presents two primary challenges. The first is identifying which institutions are the most essential for growth, and the second is figuring out how to quantitatively measure these institutions to include them in empirical research.

" The concept of 'institution' has a vast and varied definition. It encompasses innumerable factors that represent various types of institutions. The perspective presented by Sulejewicz in 2009 offers insight into the multifaceted nature of institutions, showcasing numerous institutional categories. Persson offers a more streamlined definition, outlining institutions as the rules of engagement established by either law or societal agreement or by the exercise of force by dominant elites. There are informal institutions such as trust and loyalty, while other types of institutions, such as limited liability corporations, require specific legal maneuvers to formally establish. Different types of markets require various institutions such as property rights, regulatory systems, macrosystem stabilizers, social insurance, and conflict resolution systems which include the rule of law, high-quality judiciaries, representative politics, free and fair elections, independent labor movements, social partnerships and minority representation, as in the viewpoints of Rodrik in 2007."," The term 'institution' is wide-ranging in its scope and components. It covers numerous variables that represent various types of institutions. Sulejewicz's study from 2009 showcases several institutional categories, which underscores the broadness of the term. Institutions, according to Persson's 2010 work, are the 'rules of the game' - some are lawful, while others are a product of mutual accord or the brute force of dominant groups. While some institutions, such as trust and loyalty, are informal, others like limited liability corporations require specific legislative frameworks to function. Markets depend on institutions such as property rights, regulatory institutions like conduct guidelines in commodities, services, workforce, assets, and finance. Additionally, fiscal and monetary institutions are critical for macroeconomic stabilization. Equally significant are institutions relating to social insurance and conflict management, including legal structures, high, judiciary independent of influence, representative democratic traditions, free polls, independent bargaining units, social partnerships, and instilled representation for marginalized factions, as observed by Rodrik's 2007 research."," The definition of 'institution' is broad and complex, containing a myriad of various factors representing numerous kinds of institutions. Sulejewicz's 2009 study notes several institutional classifications, underscoring the vast nature of the term. Persson describes institutions as the 'rules of the game,' including those upheld by the law or mutual agreement, or the power of dominant groups. Informal institutions such as trust and loyalty coexist alongside more formal institutions, like limited liability corporations, requiring specific legislation for formalization. Institutions are essential for markets, ranging from property rights to regulatory systems that govern the production of goods, services, labor, assets, and financial markets. Additional institutions for market stabilization include fiscal and monetary institutions and social insurance programs. Institutions for conflict management - such as court systems, democratic representation, labor unions, and social partnerships - are critical to ensure social equality from representation of minority factions to legitimate adherence to legal guidelines. Rodrik's 2007 study emphasizes the vital function of core institutions in market operations."

" Undertaking an empirical analysis that encompasses all possible types of institutions is unfeasible, hence to limit the number and kind of institutional indicators, some constraints need to be introduced. The empirical research focuses on the following indices that represent different areas of institutional environment: environmental governance indicator, human rights indicator, gender equality indicator, and corruption indicator. While economic development is gauged by measuring Gross Domestic Product per capita at Purchase Power Parity, and its economic growth is evaluated in terms of its growth rate. The empirical study examines 195 countries; however, the specific models might be estimated on the basis of fewer countries depending on the availability of the data."," Attempting to analyze all possible forms of institutions in an empirical study is impractical, which means that constraints must be involved in the number and the types of institutional indicators.

However, Pr¨®chniak [2013] goes into more detail on some of the topics."
" The augmented Solow model emphasizes the importance of institutions for economic growth, as shown by Equation (21). The relationship between economic growth and institutions is positive, meaning that better institutions lead to faster economic growth. The impact of institutions on economic growth can be tested empirically using linear regression to estimate Equation (21), but some assumptions need to be made regarding the regression model and estimation methods. For instance, Bia?owolski, Kuszewski, and Witkowski [2010] assume that all macroeconomic relationships follow a linear pattern."," The Solow model with institutional augmentation suggests that institutions are a crucial factor in the growth of an economy. Equation (21) shows that economic growth depends on both institutions and standard factors, with better institutions leading to a faster rate of economic growth. It is possible to estimate the impact of institutions on economic growth empirically by using linear regression to analyze Equation (21). However, certain assumptions about the specification of the regression model and estimation methods need to be taken into consideration. Bia?owolski, Kuszewski, and Witkowski [2010] assume that all macroeconomic relationships are defined by a linear pattern."," The institutions-augmented Solow model highlights the importance of institutions in determining economic growth, as seen in Equation (21). The equation reveals that the quality of institutions has a positive effect on economic growth, causing it to increase at a faster pace. Determining the impact of institutions on economic growth can be achieved through the use of linear regression techniques to estimate Equation (21). Nonetheless, some assumptions about the specifications of the regression model and estimation methods need to be imposed, such as assuming a linear relationship for all macroeconomic variables, as proposed by Bia?owolski, Kuszewski, and Witkowski [2010]."
" There are multiple ways to determine the variables that impact economic growth, with estimation of the regression equation being only one of them. Another method is the growth accounting exercise that involves empirical calculations to identify changes in measurable inputs, such as physical capital, human capital, and labor that lead to economic growth. The Solow residual, which represents the unexplained part of economic growth, is commonly used as a proxy for technical progress or total factor productivity. However, it's difficult to differentiate the influence of institutions from other factors using this method. Econometric methodology differs between estimating the regression equation and carrying out the growth accounting framework, so, it's not possible to make direct comparisons. If you're interested in the growth accounting exercise, you can check out research by Rapacki and Pr¨®chniak [2006]."," Finding the factors that influence economic growth relies on various methods, not just the regression equation estimation. One of these is the growth accounting exercise, which measures the extent to which changes in measurable factors like labor, physical capital, and human capital, as well as technology, led to economic growth. The Solow residual figure shows the amount of growth that didn't result from the factors measured and is interpreted as an indicator of technical progress or total factor productivity (TFP). It's important to note that the contribution of institutions to the Solow residual can't be easily distinguished from the contribution of other factors. The methods used to estimate the regression equation and to carry out the growth accounting framework involve different econometric methodologies and thus can't be compared directly. Interested readers can refer to the work of Rapacki and Pr¨®chniak [2006] for research that utilizes the growth accounting approach."," There are several ways of identifying the variables that affect economic growth, apart from the regression equation estimation. One method is the growth accounting exercise, aimed at quantifying the contribution of measurable factor inputs, such as labor, physical capital, human capital, and technology, to economic growth. The Solow residual, the unexplained portion of the total growth, is considered a proxy for the impact of technical progress or total factor productivity (TFP). The presence of institutions in the Solow residual is challenging to determine as other factors also contribute to it. Estimation of the regression equation and conducting the growth accounting framework involve distinct econometric methodologies, making it difficult to compare them. Those interested in the growth accounting exercise can refer to Rapacki and Pr¨®chniak's [2006] research."
" It is a common problem in academic literature regarding institutions that there is no universally accepted method of measuring their impact on the economy.

" The review of existing literature reveals a vast array of analytical methods that have been employed to study the relationship between institutions and economic growth. These methods include various theoretical models, institutional indicators, samples of countries and periods of time, and various econometric modeling techniques. While some tendencies towards economic growth have been identified, such as the favorable impact of economic freedom, there remain several unanswered questions. For instance, it is unclear whether the effect of institutions on economic growth is linear or nonlinear. There is still much scope for further empirical research, which is what our paper aims to address. The paper will test the validity of the institutions-augmented Solow model to explain variations in the rates of economic growth and levels of development.

" In this section, we will assess the effectiveness of the institutions-augmented Solow model in accounting for the differences in economic development and growth among countries. The analysis will begin with identifying the key factors that contribute to economic development, followed by an examination of the factors responsible for economic growth."," Examining the institutions-augmented Solow model, we will scrutinize how valid it is in explaining the variations in economic development and growth within different countries.

" Based on the data presented in Table 2, it seems that the institutions-augmented Solow model is highly effective at explaining the differences in income levels across the world. It is noteworthy that all of the regression equations feature a high R-squared value, and the estimated coefficients are consistent with our expectations, as well as theoretical analysis. For instance, variant A indicates that factors such as physical capital, human capital accumulation, population growth, and economic freedom, as assessed by the Heritage Foundation index, are the main drivers of global economic development. All of the explanatory variables, except for population growth, were found to be statistically significant. In variant B, when the institutional indicator is changed to another index of economic freedom, the results remain consistent in explaining global income level variations. However, physical capital becomes statistically insignificant, with the importance of human capital and institutions remaining high. Variant C, in which the institutional variable is the World Bank's world governance indicator, yields similar results to variant B, with physical capital being entirely insubstantial."," Examination of Table 2 suggests that the institutions-augmented Solow model is an exceptional way to understand variations in global income level. Regardless of which institutional indicator is used, all regression equations featured a very high R-squared value, and estimated coefficients match both what we expect and the theoretical analysis. Consider variant A, which suggests that approximately three-quarters of the differences in worldwide incomes can be explained by discrepancies in physical capital accumulation, human capital accumulation, population growth, and the extent of economic freedom (measured by the Heritage Foundation index of economic freedom). However, we notice that although all the explanatory variables are statistically significant, population growth has a positive sign contrary to what we expect from theory. The results are similar when we use the Fraser Institute's index of economic freedom as the institutional indicator, with a high R-squared value and retained significance for human capital and institutions; however, physical capital is insensitive in this case. Finally, variant C, with the institutional variable relying on the world governance index produced by World Bank, yields similar results to variant B, but physical capital attains complete insignificance."," According to Table 2 data, the institutions-augmented Solow model offers an outstanding explanation of differences in income levels worldwide. Regardless of the institutional indicator used, all regression equations exhibit a high R-squared value, and the estimated coefficients align with theoretical analysis and our expectations. For instance, variant A indicates that physical capital accumulation, human capital accumulation, population growth, and economic freedom, as measured by the Heritage Foundation index, explain about 75% of global differences in economic development. While all explanatory variables were statistically significant, population growth's positive sign is contrary to the theory. Meanwhile, when the institutional indicator was switched to Fraser Institute's index, the results remain consistent, with human capital and institutions remaining significant, but physical capital becoming insignificant. In variant C, with the World Bank's world governance indicator as the institutional variable, the results are akin to variant B, with physical capital being completely insignificant."
" The theoretical analysis suggests that the economic growth rate and the initial GDP per capita level have an inverse relationship, indicating the presence of convergence. There is a catching-up effect as countries experience a reduction in income differences. Factors such as the accumulation of physical and human capital, along with strong institutional policies, have a positive influence on economic growth. However, population growth has a negative impact on output dynamics."," The theoretical analysis highlights that there is a negative relationship between the economic growth rate and the initial GDP per capita level. This suggests that convergence exists, and the catching-up effect leads to a decrease in income disparities between countries. Positive relationships are observed between physical and human capital accumulation, institutional policies, and the rate of economic growth. However, population growth impedes output dynamics and has a negative influence."," The rate of economic growth and the initial GDP per capita level exhibit an inverse relationship, according to theoretical analysis. This finding confirms the existence of convergence as income disparities among countries decrease due to the catching-up effect. Positive relationships are observed between the accumulation of physical and human capital, institutional factors, and the rate of economic growth. On the other hand, population growth demonstrates a negative relationship with output dynamics."
" According to our analysis, the extended Solow model that incorporates institutional variables is a more accurate approach to explain the differences in economic development worldwide. This is due to the fact that the institutional environment, investment rate, and human capital accumulation are all connected to the supply side of an economy and hence, have a prominent influence on potential output. Conversely, economic growth rates are usually affected by numerous demand-side factors and other determinants that potentially do not reflect potential output changes accurately. Therefore, even if we average economic growth rates over several years, it is not possible to reveal long-run tendencies, and the institutional variables may fail to provide a strong explanation for economic growth. Conversely, institutional variables have long-term effects on economic development, which make them more appropriate for explaining differences in economic development."," Our analysis indicates that the Solow model comprising institutional variables is superior in explaining global disparities in economic development compared to differences in economic growth rates. This is because institutional factors, investment rates, and human capital accumulation have a direct impact on the supply side of the economy, which significantly influences potential output. On the other hand, economic growth rates are influenced by various demand-side factors and other factors, and don't accurately reflect the changes in potential output. Thus, despite averaging economic growth rates over several years, it is still not possible to detect long-term tendencies, making institutional variables less effective in explaining the differences in economic growth. Nevertheless, institutional variables display prolonged effects on economic development that potentially offer a better explanation for global disparities in economic development compared to economic growth rates."," Our analysis indicates that the Solow model extended to include institutional variables is a better approach to describe worldwide differences in economic development rather than disparities in economic growth rates. This can be attributed to the fact that institutional factors, investment rates, and human capital accumulation are all linked to the supply side of the economy and significantly affect potential output. Conversely, economic growth rates can be influenced by various demand-side factors and other forces, making it challenging to accurately reflect changes in potential output. Even if economic growth rates are averaged over several years, they still fail to reveal long-term tendencies, depriving institutional variables of providing a robust explanation for economic growth. In contrast, the influence of institutional variables on economic development is deep-rooted and long-lasting, making them a better way to account for differences in economic development worldwide."
" When interpreting the results, it is generally believed that the explanatory variables' prior values impact the present state of economic development. Although, some macroeconomic ties have reverse causation, which arises because some factors are endogenous by nature. For example, rich nations might have an advantage in terms of investing in human capital, increasing savings potentials, or having favorable systems and rules merely due to their wealth. However, detecting endogeneity requires a rigorous approach with more sophisticated econometric methods, which may be a topic for future research endeavors."," When interpreting the outcomes, it is assumed that the explanatory variables' past values influence the existing condition of economic development. However, in reality, certain macroeconomic correlations have mutual causality, which is partly due to some variables' endogenous nature. For instance, rich countries may have an advantage in investing in their human capital, increasing their savings opportunities, and having favorable systems and regulations, simply because they are wealthy. Detecting endogeneity requires a more in-depth analysis that uses advanced econometric methods, which could be a subject of further investigation."," While interpreting the results, it is commonly assumed that explanatory variables' earlier values influence the current level of economic growth. Nonetheless, some macroeconomic relationships involve mutual causation, which is partially due to some variables' endogenous nature. For example, wealthy nations may have advantages in saving, investing in their human capital, and maintaining regulations and institutions that support development - factors that could be viewed as being endogenous to their wealth. Detecting endogeneity demands a comprehensive approach with more advanced econometric tools, which could be explored in future research agendas."
" The formulated equations seem to bring forth contrasting consequences. The first one highlights the importance of human capital in propelling economic growth while the other formula gives prominence to the accumulation of physical capital. This could be elucidated by the fact that the previous equation was based on the factors that determine economic expansion. In the process of explaining disparities in economic development, human capital plays an increasingly significant role. The level of economic prosperity is an upshot of the protracted period of economic expansion that majorly banks on the amassed human capital from the past few decades. Therefore, countries that have an excess of human capital tend to achieve a greater extent of economic development."," The above equations appear to present divergent outcomes. The first one emphasizes the noteworthy involvement of human capital in the advancement of the economy while the latter formula places more importance on physical capital accumulation. This difference could be due to the fact that the first formula is derived from the determiners of economic development, highlighting the predominant role of human capital. The level of economic well-being stems from an extended period of economic growth, which largely depends on the accumulation of human capital over the past decades. Hence, countries with an abundance of human capital tend to achieve higher levels of economic development."," The equations above demonstrate slightly disparate results. The first equation accentuates the significant involvement of human capital in the process of economic advancement, while the second formula gives more weight to physical capital accumulation. This contrast may be due to the fact that the first equation was obtained based on the components that determine economic development, in which human capital plays a crucial role. Economic well-being is the result of prolonged economic growth, which ultimately depends significantly on the accumulation of human capital over several decades. Consequently, countries with more ample human capital tend to accomplish higher levels of economic development."
" In the realm of medium-term economic growth, the significance of physical capital seems to hold more weight than investment in human capital. The immediate acceleration of economic growth is a result of investment in physical capital, whereas human capital accumulation takes more time to take effect. Consequently, physical capital is deemed a more significant factor during the process of economic growth. The Uzawa-Lucas model also indicates that the development rate of less developed countries depends on whether they face a shortage of physical or human capital."," During medium-term economic growth, it appears that physical capital plays a larger role in boosting the economy as compared to investment in human capital. Investment in physical capital results in immediate economic growth acceleration, while human capital accumulation takes a longer time to take effect. Therefore, physical capital is considered to be a more significant variable during the process of economic growth. Some models of economic growth, like the Uzawa-Lucas model, argue that the pace of economic growth of a less developed country mostly depends on whether the country faces physical capital scarcity or human capital scarcity."," Medium-term economic growth tends to give more weight to physical capital as compared to investment in human capital. This is because investing in physical capital results in an immediate boost to economic growth. On the other hand, the effects of human capital accumulation take a while to manifest. Therefore, during the process of economic growth, physical capital is deemed to be a more significant variable. The Uzawa-Lucas model also suggests that the speed of economic growth of a less-developed country depends on whether the country has physical capital or human capital scarcity."
" The research suggests that institutions hold a significant role in shaping GDP, regardless of the chosen model.

" Our research focuses on the central figure of an economic man in the context of economic ethics, where we analyze the fundamental behavior patterns of individuals within economic settings. The hypotheses of a traditional rational economic man, based on Christian principles by M. Weber and S. N. Bulgakov, form the basis of our investigation as we delve into the definition of this concept. In contrast to different approaches of studying business ethics and economic ethics, we chose to scrutinize Weber and Bulgakov's characterization of an economic man to evaluate its rationality. Furthermore, we examined the viewpoints of L. von Mises and A. Sen on the freedom and innermost being of an economic man, which reiterates the importance of understanding the complexity of human nature. Our study concludes with an emphasis on the need to reconcile the conflicting egotism and altruism that coexist within an economic man if we aim to create a more altruistic economic society."," Within our research, we explore the prominent role of an economic man in economic ethics, where we scrutinize the behavior of human beings in economic settings. Considering the hypotheses of a traditional rational economic man based on the Christian principles espoused by M. Weber and S. N. Bulgakov, we define the concept and investigate its rationality. Rather than examining various business ethics and economic ethics approaches, we concentrate on Weber and Bulgakov's depiction of an economic man to evaluate his rationality. Additionally, we examine L. von Mises's and A. Sen's perspectives on an economic agent's freedom and essential nature, emphasizing that comprehending the complex nature of human character is crucial. Our study concludes with the crucial concern of reconciling the self-interest and altruism that coexist within an economic man to create a more altruistic economic society."," The focal point of our research revolves around the concept of an economic man in economic ethics, where we analyze human behavior within the boundaries of economic settings. We investigate the rationality of the traditional rational economic man's hypotheses, based on Christian principles attributed to M. Weber and S. N. Bulgakov. Our study offers a unique perspective, unlike various approaches used to analyze business ethics and economic ethics, as we focus on the definition suggested by Weber and Bulgakov when scrutinizing the rationality of the economic agent. Additionally, L. von Mises's and A. Sen's perspectives on the freedom and innate nature of an economic man emphasize the importance of understanding the complexities of human nature. To summarize, our study concludes with an emphasis on reconciling the conflicting egotism and altruism coexisting within an economic man to create a more altruistic economic society."
" Towards the end of the 19th century, the Chinese nation found itself confronted with a new set of challenges in the form of European and American capitalist powers and the impact of Western civilization. The advent of these external forces became evident to China when its military was unable to overcome the might of European and American guns and ships. China then began to observe the advantages of the West's legal and institutional frameworks, which led to an unfortunate realization of how its civilization would be impacted. Thus, Neo-Confucianism came to the fore, introducing the idea of 'external enrichment' to Confucianism, which aimed to harmonize Confucianism, capitalism, and democracy. This process of transition from internal tradition to external enrichment was an essential step for China to navigate through the challenges posed by western civilization. Russia, under Peter the Great, had a similar experience when it attempted to embrace western culture. The amalgamation of Russian and Western civilizations posed a considerable challenge for the Russian intelligentsia at the time, a challenge that has persisted well into Russia's journey into the 21st century."," In the late 1800s and early 1900s, China and Russia were forced to confront the capitalist powers of Europe and America and the influence of Western civilization. For China, the realization that its military was no match for the West's advanced weaponry was a turning point. As such, it started to take note of the legal and institutional frameworks of Western capitalist countries. This realization, however, came at a cost, as it would eventually impact its own sense of cultural identity. Therefore, Neo-Confucianism came into being to reintroduce the traditional concept of 'external enrichment' to Confucianism, which carefully blended Confucianism, democracy, and capitalism to create a new kind of modernity. Similarly, when Peter the Great decided to westernize Russia, the Russian educated elite were forced to grapple with finding ways to bring Western civilization and traditional Russian culture together. In the 21st century, Russia continues to face the issue of reconciling Western civilization with its rich cultural history, as it strives towards a more effective and equitable capitalist market economy. The academic world should take notice of this critical issue."," During the late 1800s, China and Russia both faced significant challenges due to the influence of Western civilization and the increasing power of capitalist nations like Europe and America. In China, it became evident that their military's traditional methods were no match for the modern weapons of the West. As a result, China began to observe the legal and institutional systems of Western capitalist nations. This newfound awareness also brought an understanding of how Western culture could impact China's way of life. To face this challenge, Neo-Confucianism emerged as a way to adapt traditional Confucianism to fit with the modern world, and the concepts of 'external enrichment' were introduced. This approach sought to blend traditional Chinese cultural values with the concepts of capitalism and democracy. In Russia, Peter the Great began to westernize the country, and this created a challenge for the Russian intellectuals of that era. Today, in the 21st century, reconciling Western practices with traditional cultural values remains a challenge for both countries, as they strive to develop a flourishing and just capitalist economy. Academics around the world must give attention to this crucial issue."
" During the 1950s, scholars such as Pye (1982), Mead (2001), Almond and Verba (1963), Lipset (2001), and McClelland (1987) were highly influential in advancing research methodologies during that era. As the Four Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan) experienced significant economic growth from the 1970s to 1980s, Confucian culture became an essential factor to consider. This drew the attention of prominent scholars such as Landes (1998), Fukuyama (1995), Huntington (1993), Porter (1990), and Radelet and Sachs (1998), who studied the role of Confucian ethics and culture in economic development. Since the 1990s, research on culture's impact on economic and political development has become widely popular. Although Confucian ethics played a crucial role in shaping Chinese culture, the religious culture and ethical beliefs of the Eastern Orthodox Church heavily influenced Russian culture. However, studies exploring the interaction between the Russian Orthodox ethics culture and economic development remain significantly limited. Hence, it is vital to conduct further research to observe how the Eastern Orthodox Church's culture rooted in ethical considerations drives Russian-style capitalism."," In the 1950s, research approaches were significantly improved with the contributions of scholars like Pye (1982), Mead (2001), Almond and Verba (1963), Lipset (2001), McClelland (1987), and others. With the impressive financial boom of the Four Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan) in the 1970s to 1980s, Confucian culture became a significant factor in the region.

Subsequently, scholars like Landes (1998), Fukuyama (1995), Huntington (1993), Porter (1990), and Radelet and Sachs (1998) focused their research on examining the correlation between Confucian culture and economic growth. The relationship between culture and economic and political development has been a topic of extensive research since the 1990s. Though Confucian ethics are a vital source of Chinese culture, Russian culture is mostly shaped by the religious culture and ethics of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Unfortunately, little research has been conducted on the influence and interaction between Russian Orthodox ethics culture and economic development.

" The aim of this research is to explore Amartya Sen's economic ethics theory as an analytical tool to establish a capitalist market economic ethics system for Russia. By investigating the economic ethics of Protestantism and the Eastern Orthodox Church, we can develop an ethical framework for Russia's capitalist market. The influence of the Russian Orthodox Church's culture and tradition on the country's development is undeniable; however, it has not been examined from an economic ethics perspective. A.

" Bulgakov, in his work 'The Orthodox Dogma of Eastern Orthodox Church,' highlighted the presence of 'economic man' in religion and the interconnectedness of economic activities and religious beliefs. He further suggested the most interesting topic in Economics is the relationship between religion and economics. In his discussion, he categorized the types of economic man in Christianity. These include the Puritan economic man, the Lutheran economic man, the Reformed economic man, the Quakers, and other innovative types of economic man, along with the Eastern Orthodox Church's version of economic man. Therefore, this study examines the development in the capitalist market economy and how it relates to the Eastern Orthodox Church's economic man, distinguishing it from other economic men types."," In 'The Orthodox Dogma of Eastern Orthodox Church,' Bulgakov explored the idea of 'economic man' within religions, highlighting the internal relationship between religious beliefs and economic activities.

" Bulgakov stood out among theologians of his time because unlike most of his peers, he was also an authority in economics. He taught Marxist economics at both the Lomonosov Moscow State University and the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, but eventually found himself more drawn to Orthodox theology, leading to his ordination as an Orthodox priest in 1918. However, his political beliefs resulted in a fallout with the Soviet government in 1922, and he was forced to flee to Paris, France where he went on to establish the Institute Saint-Serge. He taught dogmatics there until his death in 1944. Bulgakov's wide-ranging interests included Orthodox ethics, alternative economic systems, and economic development based on M. Weber¡¯s Christian economic ethics.  This unique blend of experience and knowledge allowed him to bring innovative ideas to modern business ethics and capitalist economic ethics. Throughout this course on capitalist economic ethics, we will explore Bulgakov's life, academic pursuits, and significant contributions to the field."," One of the most remarkable characteristics of Bulgakov was that he was not only a renowned theologian in the Russian Orthodox Church but also an expert in economics. He was a professor of Marxist economics at both the Lomonosov Moscow State University and the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. However, as time passed, he started to lean more toward Orthodox theology and was ordained as an Orthodox priest in 1918. In 1922, he was exiled to Paris, France, because of his disagreements with the Soviet government. While in Paris, he established the Institute Saint-Serge, where he taught dogmatics until his death in 1944. Bulgakov's academic interests ranged from issues such as Orthodox ethics to alternative economic system and economic development according to M. Weber¡¯s Christian economic ethics. His diverse background allowed him to bring new perspectives to modern business ethics and capitalist economic ethics. As we go through this course on capitalist economic ethics, we will go deeper into Bulgakov's background, his courses, and his theoretical contributions to the field."," The unique combination of theology and economics was what set Bulgakov apart from other contemporary theologians. He taught Marxist economics at the Lomonosov Moscow State University and the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, but eventually moved away from it towards Orthodox theology, leading to his ordination as a priest in 1918. His political beliefs and disagreements with the Soviet government led to his banishment from the country in 1922.

" Bulgakov was raised in a family of Orthodox priests and was a devoted member of the church from a young age. However, during his high school years, he began to question his faith and became an atheist and a Marxist. He gained recognition in the field of Marxism with the publication of his monograph on ""Production in a Capitalist Market"" in 1896. After returning from Western Europe in 1901, Bulgakov was heavily influenced by the works of Kant and Schelling and began to rethink Marxist economics. He argued that the rule of concentrated production in Marxist economics was at odds with rural production, which led him to publish his Master's thesis on ""Capitalism and Agriculture"". This marked a turning point in his thinking, and he began to see that human life and society were based on absolute values, such as truth, goodness, and beauty. He ultimately published ""From Marxism to Idealism"" in 1903 to detail his shift in ideology. Bulgakov acknowledged that he began his academic career as a pure social scientist, but he felt compelled to explore issues of righteousness, truth, and the existence of God while investigating the foundation of the social system. As a result, he became interested in the relationship between Christian ethics and the economy or society, which became a major focus of his research."," Bulgakov was born into a family of Russian Orthodox priests and grew up as a devout Orthodox Christian.

" Bulgakov delved into the topic of the man-God and explored different aspects of it in relation to materialistic atheism and Marx¡¯s socialism. He delved into the concept of eschatology in Christian theology and drew parallels to the prophecy of socialism's growth and the fate of capitalism. Additionally, he compared the proletariat's special mission to that of God's people and commented on their specific vocations. He also considered capital as Satan. In his essays - ""Pristine Christianity and Last Socialism"" in 1909 and ""Apocalypse and Socialism"" in 1910, Bulgakov discussed the various aspects of pseudo-Christianity. Bulgakov's notions of economic ethics highlighted that Marx's socialism and atheist pseudo-religion were underpinned solely by a self-righteous man-God who believed himself akin to Christ or a Saint but was hostile to Christianity and God-man saints. This notion of a man-God was contrary to the unique personality and soul of Christian economic man."," Bulgakov's investigation of the man-God concept consisted of exploring the properties of pseudo-Christianity inherent in materialistic atheism and Marx's socialism. He drew a comparison between the prophecy of socialism's growth and the fate of capitalism with eschatology found in Christian theology. Moreover, he observed that the proletariat's mission somewhat resembled God's chosen people, as they had specific vocations, while capital was viewed as Satan. In his two essays, ""Pristine Christianity and Last Socialism"" in 1909, and ""Apocalypse and Socialism"" 1910, Bulgakov elaborated on the idea of pseudo-Christianity. With regard to economic ethics, Bulgakov dissented that Marx's socialism or atheist pseudo-religion flourished under the self-righteousness of man-God. This man-God distinguished himself as either Christ or a saint but was, however, hostile to Christianity and God-man saints, which appeared to be in contradiction with the unique personality and soul of Christian economic man."," Bulgakov's exploration of the man-God concept entailed him examining the properties of pseudo-Christianity present in both materialistic atheism and Marx's socialism. He drew an analogy of the prophecy of socialism's development and the fate of capitalism with the eschatology present in Christian theology. He also identified that the proletariat's mission bore some resemblance to God's chosen people, who had specific vocations, while capital was seen as Satan. In his essays - ""Pristine Christianity and Last Socialism"" in 1909 and ""Apocalypse and Socialism"" in 1910, Bulgakov expounded on the topic of pseudo-Christianity. According to Bulgakov's economic ethics, Marx's socialism or atheist pseudo-religion thrived on self-righteous man-God, who claimed to be similar to Christ or a saint but espoused hostility to Christianity and God-man saints. This man-God was in contrast to Christian economic man's unique personality and soul."
" Bulgakov's dissertation, 'Philosophy of Economy: the World as Household', explored the idea of human economic behaviors alongside the concept of an economic man. Bulgakov's emphasis was on the connection between labor and the physical world as an economic activity. Economy served as a bridge that connected a person with the physical world, which could not be accessed by the dead who had no means of communication. For a Christian, the concept of rebirth and immortality signified the continuation of consumption and interaction with the physical world. Production was viewed as an individual's labor obligations and privileges in the physical world (Bulgakov 2000; Valliere 2000, pp. 253¨C278)."," In his dissertation, 'Philosophy of Economy: the World as Household', Bulgakov not only discussed the concept of an economic man but also the economic behaviors of humans. He believed that the connection between labor and the physical world was the fundamental aspect of the economy. The economy served as a bridge to connect a living person with the physical world, which was out of bounds for the dead without any means of communication. Bulgakov noted that for Christians, the idea of rebirth and immortality meant the continuation of the capacity to consume in the physical world. The act of production was upheld as the rights and obligations of an individual's labor in the physical world (Bulgakov 2000; Valliere 2000, pp. 253-278)."," Bulgakov's doctoral thesis, 'Philosophy of Economy: The World as Household', examined not only the idea of an economic man but also human economic behavior. According to Bulgakov, the fundamental aspect of the economy was the relationship between labor and the physical world. The economy acted as a bridge that connected the living person with the physical world, which was beyond the reach of the dead who lacked the ability to communicate with it. In Christian doctrine, rebirth and immortality implied continued consumption in the physical world. Bulgakov viewed production as an individual's labor rights and responsibilities in the physical world (Bulgakov 2000; Valli¨¨re 2000, pp. 253¨C278)."
" Bulgakov's writings delved into the complex interplay between economic systems and religious beliefs, particularly in Christian economic ethics. His works, such as ""The Soul of Socialism"" and ""Social Teaching in Modern Russian Orthodox Theology,"" explored how religious values could potentially guide economic theories and practices. As both an economist and a Russian Orthodox theologian, Bulgakov was known for his interest in Christian socialism, which he believed could provide a more soulful approach to economic systems than soulless socialism. His thinking emphasized the importance of considering an economic man's properties through Christian principles, and addressing the foundations of economic ethics by incorporating a Christian viewpoint in both socialist and capitalist systems."," Bulgakov's thoughts and views surrounding economic ethics and the notion of a Christian economic man were thoroughly expounded on in numerous works, including ""The Soul of Socialism"" and ""Social Teaching in Modern Russian Orthodox Theology."" As an economist and Russian Orthodox theologian, Bulgakov approached the relationship between Christianity and socialism with a unique perspective. He contended that socialism lacked the fundamental values that Christianity could provide in creating an ethical economic system. Bulgakov's ideas highlighted the significance of taking into account an economic man's characteristics from a Christian standpoint and recognizing the foundation of economic ethics by combining Christian views in socialist and capitalist economic systems."," Bulgakov's writings explored the connection between economic ethics and Christian beliefs, offering a distinct perspective on the concept of a Christian economic man.

As an economist and Russian Orthodox theologian, Bulgakov's approach to Christian socialism emphasized the need for a more spiritual approach to economic systems than what he deemed as the soulless nature of socialism. His reasoning revolved around considering an economic man's traits from a Christian standpoint and establishing a foundation for economic ethics that integrated Christian values in both socialist and capitalist economic systems."
" The study of economic growth can be traced back to the works of Adam Smith's ""An Inquiry into the Wealth of Nations"" and J.M. Keynes' ""The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money,"" which sparked a renewed interest in academia to examine economic growth. Researchers such as R.F. Harrod, E.D. Domar, R.M. Solow, N. Kaldor, J. Tobin, and others investigate the complex nature of economic growth, analyzing factors such as increased labor productivity, the accumulation of capital, and disruptive technological advancements in production."," The concept of economic growth has its origins in the seminal works of Adam Smith's ""An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations"" and J.M.

" On the contrary, the Demand-Side School accentuates on the role of government intervention, specifically through increasing public spending, to boost aggregate demand and fuel economic growth. However, economic growth research has expanded beyond these traditional schools of thought and encompassed a range of interdisciplinary factors, such as socio-cultural dynamics and environmental sustainability. This new focus highlights the importance of equitable and sustainable economic development that benefits both present and future generations."," Taking a different approach altogether, the Post-Keynesian School advocates for the government to play an active role in maintaining full employment and stabilizing the economy through monetary and fiscal policies. This school also highlights the importance of understanding the role of power dynamics in economic systems and how it affects economic outcomes. This perspective calls for a more nuanced approach to understanding economic growth, beyond just the traditional measures of productivity and output, and emphasizes the need for a more socially just and democratic economic system."," In contrast, the Austrian School of Economics emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and entrepreneurship as key drivers of economic growth. They believe that government intervention in the economy can lead to imbalances and inefficiencies, and instead promote the idea that a free market system will ultimately lead to optimal outcomes. While this approach has received criticism for not adequately addressing issues such as inequality and externalities, it continues to be an influential perspective in economic theory and policy."
" In Sen's view, economic development is inextricably tied to substantive freedom. This means that any threats to individuals' free will must be removed before economic progress can be made. Sen also advocated for a critical approach to economics and praised the contributions of economists who utilized logical and engineering principles, including Sir William Petty, Francois Quesnay, and David Ricardo. Additionally, Sen acknowledged the importance of morality and ethics in economic theory, highlighting the works of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, and Francis Edgeworth. By emphasizing the interplay of freedom, critical thinking, and ethics, Sen provided important insights into the factors that contribute to long-term economic growth."," According to Sen, human freedom and economic development are closely intertwined. For true economic progress to take place, Sen argued that individuals must have the freedom to make decisions that are in their best interest. He also emphasized the need for critical thinking in economic analysis, recognizing the contributions of economists such as Sir William Petty, Leon Walras, and Francois Quesnay. Sen further noted that the study of economics was incomplete without taking into account the ethical considerations that impact individuals' economic decision-making. In this context, Sen identified the works of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, and other economists as instrumental in shaping economic thought around issues of morality and ethics."," In Sen's view, economic development can only occur in a society that upholds and promotes substantive freedom. Any constraints on individual autonomy must be eliminated for true progress to be achieved. Sen also believed in the importance of critical thinking in economics, recognizing the contributions of thinkers such as Sir William Petty and Leon Walras who advanced engineering principles in economic analysis. Finally, Sen argued that the discipline of economics is incomplete without a consideration of ethical and moral issues. He cited works by Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill that placed a particular emphasis on these considerations, showing that economics can be used to advance a more equitable and just society."
" The concept of human autonomy is central to the Christian faith, with different denominations such as the Eastern Orthodox Church, Catholicism, and Protestantism valuing the idea of human agency. The question of 'who are we as humans?' and 'what is our relationship with a higher power?' underpins discussions about free will. The term 'Imago Dei' from the book of Genesis in the Old Testament is employed in Christianity to explain human identity, emphasizing how man's attributes, such as rationality, morality, and freedom of choice, reflect those of God. According to Catholic theologian Karl Rahner, humans play a crucial role in the faith, being the receivers of the Word of God. However, there is debate about whether the image of God in humanity can be restored through salvation, or if it was shattered by the Original Sin and has remained damaged ever since."," Human freedom is a fundamental aspect of Christianity that is highly valued by different denominations such as the Eastern Orthodox Church, Catholicism, and Protestantism.

It is uncertain whether the image of God in human beings can be restored through salvation or whether it was shattered by Original Sin, leaving humanity flawed but nonetheless still connected to God."
" Luther emphasized the significance of faith amidst the given constraints of limited freedom. Christians with faith can believe in their own salvation and have the liberty to pursue their tasks without any pressure to earn God's approval or recognition. Those without faith experienced anxiety, distress, and discontent (Althaus and Schultz 1972, pp. 37-39). The ultimate goal of salvation is achieved by waiting entirely on God and having complete trust in Him, while detaching ourselves from self-centered pursuits (Althaus and Schultz 1972, p. 55; Brendler 1991; Hummel 2003). Only after redemption, man can freely serve God with a liberated soul."," Luther acknowledged the limitations imposed on believers by the concept of ""limited freedom."" He maintained that faith is the key to Christian virtue, allowing them to believe in their own salvation and giving them the freedom to carry out their tasks without seeking God's recognition or performing sacred deeds just to please Him. Althaus and Schultz (1972) argue that those without faith are troubled, causing them to worry and feel miserable. To achieve salvation, one must wait wholeheartedly for God and trust in Him entirely while abandoning one's self-centered desires (Althaus and Schultz 1972, p. 55; Brendler 1991; Hummel 2003). Ultimately, freedom to serve God comes to those who have been redeemed."," Luther addressed the challenge of limited freedom faced by Christians and stressed the importance of faith. Having faith enables them to trust in their own salvation and grants them the freedom to perform their tasks without feeling coerced to perform religious activities to gain God's recognition. Althaus and Schultz (1972) suggest that those without faith are riddled with worry and distress. The path to achieve salvation is attained by putting wholehearted trust in God and abandoning all self-serving endeavors (Althaus and Schultz 1972, p. 55; Brendler 1991; Hummel 2003). Thus, it is only after experiencing redemption that one can genuinely embrace their freedom to serve God."
" Eastern Orthodox Theology sets itself apart by highlighting the Eastern origins of many Christian religious practices and beliefs, given the historic presence of early churches in the region. Furthermore, Orthodox theologians argue that the Greek language is a more precise tool for expressing Christian doctrine than Latin, since it can better capture the nuanced differences in concepts underlying Greek theology. This view challenges the West's understanding of Christian theology and calls for increased recognition of the contributions of the East to the evolution of Christian thought."," An important aspect of Eastern Orthodox Theology is its emphasis on the deep historical roots of many Christian religious rituals and beliefs to the East.

Additionally, Eastern Orthodoxy holds that the Church is an embodiment of the divine truth and that one's spiritual journey is best supported through participation in the sacramental life of the Church. Emphasizing the importance of community and tradition, the Eastern Orthodox tradition continues to be an important and distinct voice in contemporary Christianity."
" Sen's theory on economic development revolves around the relationship between human freedom and progress. He believed that humans, when given true freedom, could unlock their potential to develop their skills, thus acquiring a distinct status or identity, such as being a soldier, doctor, volunteer, etc. Sen described this identity as ""being,"" which was different from Weber's religious concept of ""calling"" or ""Beruf."" Weber's idea was based on the Calvinist Puritans' aspiration to reach the Kingdom of God, where they reshaped the world through asceticism. Weber believed that capitalists could efficiently use this voluntary labor productivity increase. However, the world of work has significantly changed since then, and asceticism has been inherited by the Enlightenment's pursuit of wealth devoid of religious implications. Thus, the concept of Calling (Beruf) has been reduced to materialistic economic impulses. Nevertheless, after asceticism gave birth to capitalism, it slowly faded away."," Sen's economic development theory draws upon the association between human autonomy and advancement. The theory posits that true freedom allows individuals to utilize their talents to become part of a particular social, professional, or hierarchical group like doctors, soldiers, volunteers, and so on. Sen explained this position or identity as ""being"" and differentiated it from Weber's religious interpretation of ""calling"" or ""Beruf."" Weber had brought up the idea of Calvinist Puritans who rigorously followed the path of asceticism in the desire to serve God's kingdom and reshape the world. Weber believed that capitalists could fully reap the benefits of voluntarily productive workers. However, once the capitalist mode of production replaced man with machines, and the Enlightenment inherited asceticism, the ""Beruf"" or ""calling"" concept turned into an economic or materialistic driver, delegitimizing its religious or ethical connotations. After asceticism gave birth to capitalism, it slowly degraded into capitalism's pursuit of wealth."," Sen's theory of economic development emphasizes the connection between human freedom and progress. He believed that genuine freedom enables individuals to access their talents and develop their abilities to become part of a specified group, profession, or status such as doctors, soldiers, volunteers, and so forth. Sen refers to this position or identity as ""being"" and distinguishes it from Weber's religious notion of ""calling"" or ""Beruf."" For Weber, Calvinist Puritans sought to become Berufsmenschen, by reshaping the world through austerity in their desire to reach the Kingdom of God. Weber believed that employers could efficiently utilize voluntary labor productivity for their capitalist enterprise. Nonetheless, after the capitalist mode of production replaced human beings with machines, the concept of ""calling"" was reduced to economic incentives, and the pursuit of wealth, lacking ethical or spiritual associations. As a result, the concept of ""calling"" lost its religious significance and declined with the ascendancy of capitalism."
" Bulgakov's concept of man as Logos and as a creator of this economic world led him to propose a combination of asceticism and man's role in governing and abandoning the world.

" The Eastern Orthodox perspective on the new economic man characterizes man as the ultimate architect and ruler of the economic world, designated by a higher power to cultivate and manage this domain. However, this does not absolve man of labor rights and responsibilities, as he is expected to co-create with God towards the ultimate goal of divinization of the world. In this light, economic freedoms that lead to convenience and open markets can be seen as favorable, complemented by essential human rights that guarantee freedom in diverse aspects of society. Applying Sen's five primary ""instrumental freedoms"" could enable the Russian government to foster desirable economic conditions, safeguard existing freedoms, and reinforce its overall progress."," In the Eastern Orthodox belief, the new economic man is considered to be a divinely appointed representative of God to govern and manage the economic world while participating in the divine mission of divinization. Consequently, man is endowed with the right to work and expected to take on certain obligations as well. The 'instrumental freedoms' that allow for economic convenience, basic human rights, and free trade in the market, are seen as facilitators of these expectations. The successful application of Sen's five 'instrumental freedoms' may create an enabling environment for Russia, including ensuring freedom, nurturing economic development, and social progress."," The Eastern Orthodox perspective regards the new economic man as the embodiment of God's authority over the economic world. Man is obligated to govern and create in conjunction with God towards the realization of the divine mission of world divinization, therefore labor rights and obligations are embedded in his nature. The 'instrumental freedoms,' which promote economic convenience and freedom as well as basic human rights and free trade, are desirable within this construct. To Russia, the proactive adoption of Sen's five 'instrumental freedoms' as a part of its development strategy could result in a conducive environment for flourishing economic and social sectors, and the safe-guarding of individual freedoms."
" Our discussion revolved around the implications of Bulgakov's Christian economic man in the context of Sen's arguments on human substantive freedom and economic behavior. Concurrently, we delved into the theology of human freedom, God's divine plan, predestination, justification, mysticism, deification, and the economic ethics of a specific economic system. Moreover, we explored Weber's analysis of the man working in a vocation within the parameters of Lutheranism and Calvinism."," We analyzed the concept of Christian economic man as put forward by Bulgakov, and its relation to Sen's arguments on human economic behavior and its impact on economic systems. Alongside this, we explored the different facets of human freedom that arise from theological perspectives such as God's direction for humanity, predestination, justification, mysticism, and deification, and how they inform the economic ethics of specific economic systems.

" Bulgakov's rejection of Marxist ideology was evident in his ideas about the economic man, which were present in his statements from 1903 to 1911. Later on, he elaborated on this concept in his dissertation 'Philosophy of Economy' and other essays that were influenced by Weber's concept of a Christian economic man. Bulgakov discussed various interpretations of this concept, including those pertaining to Catholicism, Orthodox Church, Puritanism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Quakers. Despite the significance of this viewpoint in theology, it did not receive enough attention in contrast to traditional economic views. Hence, there is a new research domain that can be activated through the revaluation of the concept of the economic man defined with new significance."," Bulgakov's rejection of Marxism was reflected in his views on the economic man that he expressed in his statements from 1903 to 1911.

Bulgakov discussed different Christian interpretations of the concept, such as those related to Catholicism, Orthodox Church, Puritanism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Quakers. However, this viewpoint received less attention as compared to the traditional economic view of the economic man. Therefore, there is an opportunity to explore a new research domain by re-assessing the concept of the economic man with renewed significance."," When examining Bulgakov's rejection of Marxism, one can observe that his statements about the economic man from 1903 to 1911 conveyed a particular attitude.

Bulgakov explored how different Christian denominations, such as Catholicism, Orthodox Church, Puritanism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Quakers, interpreted this concept. However, despite its theological significance, the economic man view presented by Bulgakov did not gain as much attention as the traditional economic perspective. Thus, there is an opportunity to advance research by re-evaluating the concept of the economic man from a fresh perspective."
" Jones' study on the transformation of a profit-driven economic individual to a community-oriented one did not delve into the aspect of spiritual manifestation in a person's economic behavior, which was explicated in Smith's work on the moral sentiments of individuals and their effect on economic choices. Smith's work underscores the significance of morality and ethics in economic conduct, which distinguishes it from purely profit-oriented behavior. On a related note, the depiction of a man's economic behavior as an expression of Christian values or as part of one's calling, as shown in Dante's Divine Comedy and Ruskin's Unto This Last, respectively, seems to be in line with Smith's view of economic agents as moral beings."," In her research, Williams examines the shift from a consumerist culture to a more sustainable economy and the role that individuals play in this transition. However, there was no discussion on the psychological aspects of economic behavior, something that was notably analyzed in Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents. Freud's thesis is that human desires and motives are often at odds with social norms and expectations, causing inner strife and frustration. This, in turn, affects economic behavior, as individuals may try to fulfill these desires and motives through consumerism, leading to unsustainable economic practices. Additionally, Hirschman's concept of exit, voice, and loyalty argues that people's economic behaviors are influenced by their perception of their options in socio-economic institutions. This idea emphasizes the importance of individuals' trust in socio-economic institutions for a sustainable economy."," Nguyen's research on energy consumption and its impact on the environment touches on a crucial issue, but it overlooks the impact of cultural factors on individuals' energy usage patterns. Clifford Geertz's symbolic anthropology, for instance, stresses the significance of cultures and symbols in shaping human behavior. Geertz argues that people imbue these symbols with meanings that guide their actions, including economic behavior. Hence, individuals' energy consumption can be influenced by their cultural beliefs and practices, such as how they view electricity or their level of environmental awareness. Furthermore, Bourdieu's theory of habitus is relevant when examining individuals' energy consumption patterns as cultural norms and habits can become ingrained in individuals, affecting their economic behavior. A sustainable energy transition would, therefore, require addressing these cultural dimensions to alter energy consumption modes."
" The intersection between economic practices and religious thought has been a topic of interest for scholars like Smith and Freud. While Smith argued for the benefits of economic self-interest, Freud emphasized the psychological impact of excessive greed on individuals and the society at large. Both Smith and Freud discussed the concept of an egoistic economic man, who prioritizes wealth over moral or ethical values. However, while Smith believed that the pursuit of self-interest would ultimately benefit society, Freud recognized the negative consequences of excessive self-interest, leading to a fragmented society and moral decay."," The relationship between economic man and ethics has been a subject of study for many economists and philosophers, including Mill and Nietzsche. Mill focused on the concept of liberty and the need for ethical considerations in economic practices, cautioning against the dangers of limiting personal freedoms for economic gain. Meanwhile, Nietzsche highlighted the role of morality in shaping the economic man and the influence of dominant moral perspectives on economic practices. Both Mill and Nietzsche acknowledged the existence of an economic man who prioritizes personal gain, but Mill's emphasis on ethical considerations set him apart from Nietzsche's emphasis on the role of morality in shaping economic practices."," The correlation between economic systems and moral values has long fascinated scholars across disciplines such as Marx and Durkheim. Marx's theory mainly focused on the economic exploitation of the working class, who were unable to reclaim the full value of their labor due to the capitalist ownership of the means of production. Durkheim, on the other hand, emphasized the moral and social implications of economic change, arguing that the division of labor, while beneficial for society, could also cause anomie, a state of normlessness and moral confusion. Both Marx and Durkheim recognized the importance of economic structures in shaping individuals' behavior and cultural values, and the need to create a balance between economic progress and social cohesion."

" The article puts forth compelling reasons why computation plays a crucial role in any well-organized economy, including a planned one. It argues that such an economy requires computation terms that are beyond the bounds of even infinity. Furthermore, the paper addresses the objections raised by some scholars in 2007 in response to Murphy's theses, proving them to be invalid."," Through its argumentative analysis, the paper stands to support the claim that computing is an integral part of a planned economy, and demands the need for dealing with endless and uncountable domains. In addition, the paper effectively invalidates critiques of Murphy's theses voiced by some researches in 2007, reinforcing the thesis' standing."," The article provides a fresh perspective on the importance of computation in a planned economy by bringing into focus the need to develop algorithms to handle infinite and uncountable domains.

" The ability to perform computations and calculations plays a crucial role in any economic system. The problem with economic calculation has far-reaching implications for institutional policies and settlements. Different institutional frameworks can affect the possibility of rational resource allocation through computation. Thus, it is essential to consider the outcomes of the economic calculation debate. When defining institutions and policies, it is imperative to take into account the ability to perform computations and calculations within an economic system from the perspective of economists and philosophers."," In any economic system, the practical importance of computations and calculations is clear. The economic calculation problem is not neutral to institutional settlements and policies. Different institutional frameworks can impede the very ability to perform economic calculations and allocate resources rationally.

" Computability theory in an economic system is primarily concerned with whether economic problems can be solved using computable functions. Though modern computing devices possess tremendous computational power, it cannot always guarantee that any problem, including economic ones, can be solved with enough time and resources. As such, the feasibility of using computers as the primary tool for tackling economic issues remains an open question that requires further study and examination."," Computability theory in the context of an economic system is concerned with determining whether economic problems are solvable using computable functions.

The applicability of using computers as the primary tool to tackle economic problems remains a topic of study and requires investigation to better understand its limitations and potential drawbacks."
" The fundamental problem of economics concerns the efficient distribution of resources within an economic system. For every individual, including those living self-sufficient lifestyles, the task of allocating resources rationally presents itself due to there being more needs and wants than resources to satisfy them. An excellent way to understand this problem involves examining the rational allocation of energy. Energy is a crucial resource for everyone, and efficiency in how it is allocated can have a significant impact on the outcome of an economic system."," At the crux of the economic dilemma is the issue of resource allocation in an economic structure. Even individuals who live in self-sufficient ways must grapple with this problem, as there are almost always more requirements or desires than resources available to fulfill them. To better understand the dilemma, we may look at the efficient allocation of natural resources. Natural resources, like land, are finite, and the optimal distribution must consider what satisfies the most needs while providing the most overall value."," Economics revolves around resource allocation in an economic system in the most rational way possible. Even people who live self-sufficient lives face this problem since wants and needs typically surpass the available resources. A useful example of this dilemma would be the optimal allocation of knowledge. People and organizations must know what knowledge is essential and prioritize it while setting aside unimportant information. Ignoring this allocation of knowledge can result in inefficiencies in the economic system, consequently stifling growth and development."
" In his argument, von Mises asserts that in an economic system based on collective property, the potential for economic calculation is rendered impossible, regardless of whether the planner has access to all the pertinent information. Von Mises's thought experiment takes into account that the planner has access to all current technology and the complete inventory of production elements. A team of specialists provides them with extensive information, and all members of the society are in agreement on the end goal. Yet, the planner continues to face an intricate problem: how to choose from a broad range of available options that can potentially enable them to attain their objectives most efficiently. For instance, if the planner intends to build a house, there are numerous approaches to this, with each having their own trade-offs regarding resource consumption, production time, and the final outcome. The planner must consider multiple factors, such as the quality of building materials, labor costs, efficiency of tools and machines, and resource utilization, in determining an optimal approach."," Von Mises argues that economic calculation is impossible in an economic system based on collective property, even if the planner has access to all relevant information. In his hypothetical scenario, the planner has complete inventory knowledge of all production factors and technological resources, and a team of experts provides them with extensive reports. Moreover, all individuals in the society agree upon the common ends. However, the planner encounters a fundamental issue in selecting the most suitable approach from the infinite number of projects and tools available to achieve their goals. For example, when building a house, there exist different methods, each with a unique set of advantages and disadvantages regarding resource consumption, production time, and the final outcome. The planner must compare several factors, such as the quality of building materials, labor costs, machinery productivity, and resource usage, to make an informed decision on the best course of action."," Von Mises contends that even with complete access to all relevant information, economic calculation remains an insurmountable challenge in a system based on collective property. In his hypothetical model, the planner has a comprehensive inventory of all production factors, all technological knowledge available at the time, and detailed reports from a team of experts. Additionally, all members of society agree on the ultimate common goals. However, the planner encounters a complex problem in selecting the most efficient methodology from the countless options available to achieve their targets. For instance, in building a house, there are many techniques, each with its own benefits and limitations regarding resource consumption, production time, and final output. The planner must evaluate various factors, such as the quality of the building materials, equipment productivity, labor costs, and resource usage, while making a decision."
" In a multifaceted economy, the manufacturing techniques are incredibly diverse. The means of production are not entirely specific, nor entirely non-specific. If all of the ways of production were exclusively one or the other, selecting the mode of production and determining which means to use would pose a purely technological challenge, rather than an economic one (von Mises, 1998, pp. 207-8). Even in a simple economy, making a logical choice between a variety of different means and methods of production would have some constraints. In a complicated economy, the main challenge is not figuring out which final products to create. Even in a socialist economy, this isn't a particularly difficult issue. If given a choice between 1,000 hl of wine or 800 hl of wine, or 1,000 hl of oil versus 500 hl of oil, it can be resolved relatively quickly. However, after this decision is made, the true and intractable difficulty arises (for the planned economy): how to select the best means and methods of production to achieve the desired outcomes (von Mises, 1990, p. 13)."," In the midst of a complex economy, there is an extensive range of production methods in place. The means of production falls somewhere in between being entirely specific and entirely non-specific. If each medium of production were all specific or all non-specific, then determining the mode of production and which means to employ would be purely a technological matter, instead of an economic one (von Mises, 1998, pp. 207-8). Even in a simple economy, selecting the most reasonable choice between heterogeneous means and production techniques would show some limitations. In a multifarious economy, the prime challenge is not figuring out which final goods to produce. Even in a socialist economy, this is not a particularly complicated matter. One can determine whether to produce 1,000 hl of wine or 800 hl of wine, or 1,000 hl of oil versus 500 hl of oil, and so forth. Nonetheless, once this decision has been made, the true and unsolvable problem arises for the planned economy: determining the most beneficial means and methods of production to achieve the end goals (von Mises, 1990, p. 13)."," In a highly intricate economy, the production methods used are incredibly diverse. The means of production fall somewhere in between being entirely specific or entirely non-specific. If every means of production were completely uniform in nature, selecting the production method and output specifications would be solely a technological challenge, devoid of any economic considerations (von Mises, 1998, pp. 207-8). Even in a comparatively simple economy, choosing between diverse production methods and means of production would have its limitations. In a complex economy, the primary difficulty does not lie in selecting the final products to manufacture. Even in a socialist economy, this is not an overwhelmingly complicated question; one can decide whether to produce 1,000 hl of wine or 800 hl of wine, or 1,000 hl of oil instead of 500 hl of oil. However, once this decision is made, the real challenge begins, which is selecting the most efficient means and methods of production to achieve the intended outcomes. This is an intractable problem for the planned economy (von Mises, 1990, p. 13)."
" The market prices of goods, which are represented through a common exchange medium, are vital as they allow for informed decisions when it comes to selecting the best means and methods of production from a wide range of options. In this way, monetary calculation pertaining to these prices is based on a private property system where entrepreneurs compete to purchase the final and intermediate goods they require. This enables a rational allocation of resources, solving the economic dilemma."," The significance of market prices is that they facilitate informed decision making in regards to the selection of the most appropriate means and methods of production from a plethora of available alternatives. This is possible through monetary calculation based on market prices determined within a private property system, where entrepreneurs compete to acquire the final goods and intermediate goods they need. In the end, this allows for a rational allocation of resources and solves the economic problem."," The importance of market prices lies in their ability to enable logical decision-making with regards to selecting the most effective means and methods of production from a wide range of potential options. This is achieved through the use of monetary calculation based on market prices, which are established within a private property system where entrepreneurs bid for the final goods and intermediate goods they need. Ultimately, this process leads to rational resource allocation and solves the economic problem."
" The viewpoints presented by both Abba Lerner and Oskar Lange highlight the importance of market prices in economic calculation. However, they rejected the notion that a free market based on private property is a compulsory requirement for economic calculation. They believed that planners could imitate any market outcome. Lange, in his works of 1936 and 1937, advocated for market socialism and emphasized that three types of data were required for economic calculation - individual preferences, prices, and information regarding available resources. An important dissimilarity between von Mises and Lange is their idea of prices. Lange asserted that prices could be determined by utilizing individual preferences and the quantity of available resources, and suggested following a trial and error process or a Tatonnement solution to find the equilibrium prices of goods. On the other hand, von Mises opined that price determination is only possible in a market economy that emphasizes private property."," Observations made by Abba Lerner and Oskar Lange regarding market prices in economic calculation highlight their significance; however, they defied the idea that free markets founded on private property are fundamental to economic calculation. They argued that any market outcome could be replicated by planners. Lange, in his papers of 1936 and 1937, supported market socialism and proclaimed that three types of data were imperative for economic calculation - individual preferences, prices, and knowledge about available resources. Important differences between von Mises and Lange exist concerning the concept of prices. Lange believed that prices could be based on individual choices and the abundance of resources and recommended a trial and error procedure or a Tatonnement solution to determine ""correct,"" equilibrium prices of goods. In contrast, von Mises contended that private property-based systems in a market economy were necessary for price determination."," Abba Lerner and Oskar Lange acknowledged the importance of market prices in economic calculations. However, they rejected the notion that a free market economy based on private property is necessary for economic calculation. They argued that planners could replicate market outcomes. Lange's notion about market socialism is based on three types of data essential for economic calculations- individual preferences, prices, and knowledge about available resources. The significant difference between von Mises and Lange is their perception of prices. Lange proposed that prices could be determined by individual preferences and the amount of available resources, a trial and error process, or a Tatonnement solution to find the correct equilibrium prices of goods. Conversely, von Mises believed that price determination could only take place in a market economy based on private property."
" Lavoie's (1981) revised version states that von Mises' critique of socialism still stands even in the context of market socialism. Lange's solution was based on the Walrasian model of a static, general equilibrium, which von Mises and the Austrian School deemed unsuitable due to the dynamic nature of economic adjustment and discovery amidst a constantly shifting structure. In static conditions, socialist economic calculation may function, but such circumstances are not applicable in practical settings. The problem is not insufficient equations; instead, it is that the equations cannot be established from the outset in an economy organized around collective property types."," Lavoie's (1981) revised version contends that even advocates of market socialism do not invalidate von Mises' critique of socialism. Lange relied on the Walrasian model of static, general equilibrium in formulating his solution, but von Mises and the Austrian School believed that this was not suitable. They pointed out that economic adjustment and discovery occur in a dynamic framework in response to continuously evolving factors like technology and preferences. Von Mises acknowledged that economic calculation may work in socialism under static conditions, but this is not feasible in real-world situations. The challenge is not the sheer number of equations to be solved, but the impossibility of establishing such equations initially in an economy that is based on collective forms of property."," In Lavoie's (1981) revised edition, he argues that von Mises' critique of socialism continues to hold valid, despite support for market socialism. Lange based his resolution around the Walrasian model of static, general equilibrium, which von Mises and the Austrian School criticized and claimed to be inappropriate. According to them, dynamic adjustment and discovery are central to economic calculation in consideration of the constantly evolving factors such as technology and preferences. It is true that economic calculation in socialism may function under static circumstances, but this concept may not work in real-world scenarios. The hurdle is not the number of equations to be addressed, but rather the inability to establish these equations initially in a collective form of property-based economic system."
" A recent discourse on the constraints of computability in an economic system reliant on central planning and collective property ownership will be analyzed in the following section. Robert Murphy, who assumed a revised position in the economic calculation debate, developed a novel argument to support his thesis that computational models are not capable of solving the economic problem in principle (Murphy, 2006). As opposed to Murphy's argument, Cottrell et al. (2007a, b) adhered to the conventional stance in the economic calculation debate and opposed Murphy's argument."," In the upcoming section, we will be examining a recent debate surrounding the boundaries of computability in an economic system that depends on central planning and collective property.

" Murphy argues that the market process is dynamic, and entrepreneurs play a critical role in constantly innovating to meet consumers' ever-changing needs. Therefore, the list of goods to be produced is not static but constantly evolving, making it impossible for a central planning unit to mimic the market perfectly. If the central planner is to do so, it must include all potential future goods and services that might appear in the market, including those that might be created through technological advancements in the future. To provide accurate prices for all final and intermediate goods required for consumer goods production, the central planning unit must maintain corresponding lists of prices for both types of goods."," In Murphy's view, entrepreneurs are continually innovating and creating new goods and services to meet the demands of consumers. As a result, the list of goods that should be produced is constantly changing and expanding. If the central planning unit is to imitate the market processes, it must take into account all possible future goods and commodities that may appear on the market. This includes intermediate goods, such as machinery and equipment, that are essential for producing the final consumer goods. The central planner must also have corresponding lists of prices for all final goods and intermediate goods to ensure that prices reflect the true value of these goods. While this may appear to be an impossible task for a central planning unit, it is essential to ensure that the system can operate efficiently and produce what consumers need."," Murphy highlights the dynamic nature of the market process, where entrepreneurs are continuously exploring new ways of satisfying consumers' needs. This results in the creation of new goods and services, making the list of products to be produced ever-changing. In order for a central planning unit to simulate the market process, it must consider all the possible future goods and commodities that may emerge. Such a list would include intermediate goods necessary for the production of final consumer goods, as well. The list must also have corresponding prices for final and intermediate goods to ensure that the economy functions efficiently. While mimicking the market processes presents challenges, it is essential to have a clear picture of the potential goods and services that may emerge on the market."
" To demonstrate the uncountable infiniteness of prices, it's worth examining Cantor's diagonal argument, which Hunter (1996) found to be useful in establishing the existence of an uncountable set. Understanding this concept can provide a foundation for grasping why the number of prices can't be counted, thereby avoiding the common misconception that it's finite."," To prove that the number of prices is uncountably infinite, it's helpful to delve into Cantor's diagonal argument and its application in establishing the existence of an uncountable set, as suggested by Hunter (1996). Only by understanding this process can one grasp why there are so many prices, and why they can't be enumerated or identified in an orderly, finite manner."," Hunter (1996) proposed exploring Cantor's diagonal argument to explain the uncountable infiniteness of prices. This argument can help prove the existence of an uncountable set and provide insight into why the number of prices can't be finite, despite common misconceptions. By understanding this concept, we can recognize that prices are plentiful and can't be simply counted, only estimated or approximated."
" According to the analysis of Cottrell et al. (2007a, b), R. Murphy's assertions regarding the uncountability or infinity of the set of market prices are unsubstantiated. They assert that every commodity is derived from a finite number of other commodities, and therefore, it logically follows that the total number of all commodities is countable, and not infinite. More specifically, every commodity can be represented by a unique number expressed as a Godel number that consists of the number of atoms of each element it contains. Based on this framework, Cottrell et al. stated that all possible commodities can be listed and numbered, resulting in a countable and finite set. It thus follows that the set of commodities and prices are also finite and countable."," Cottrell et al. (2007a, b) contend that R. Murphy's argument lacks support in proving that the set of market prices is infinite or uncountable. They assert that every commodity can be traced back to a finite set of raw materials, and thus the overall number of commodities is also finite and countable. By assigning a unique integer identifier to every commodity, based on its characteristic set of atoms, one can create a one-to-one correspondence between commodities and natural numbers. Consequently, the set of commodities and their respective prices can be viewed as a countable and finite collection. Therefore, the idea that the set of market prices is uncountable or infinite is unfounded, according to Cottrell et al. (2007a, b)."," In their analysis, Cottrell et al. (2007a, b) rebuke R. Murphy's incapacity to demonstrate either the uncountability or infinity of the set of market prices. They argue that every commodity is produced from a concrete number of other commodities and base goods, all constructed from a finite collection of atoms. Therefore, the entirety of commodities can be assigned an integer identifier, a Godel number, along with every element's quantity it consists of. By creating this enumeration, one can confidently conclude that all possible combinations of goods and commodities are countable and finite. Therefore, Cottrell et al. conclude that the market's set of commodities and their corresponding prices is countable and finite, and not uncountable or infinite."
" The concept of infinite uncountable prices in a market economy poses an interesting question about the practicality of considering all possible prices when making economic decisions. Cottrell et al. (2007a, b, p. 3) suggested that individuals do not need to do so as it would be impossible to consider all potential prices and still solve the problem of economic calculation. However, Murphy argues that central planning must consider every possible price, inclusive of those that do not exist yet, and goods and services to plan the economy effectively. This debate highlights the challenge of determining the optimal approach to economic planning and the level of information that must be taken into account to make informed decisions."," The debate surrounding whether all possible prices and goods/ services should be considered when making economic decisions is a complicated issue. Cottrell et al. (2007a, b, p. 3) suggests that in a market economy with infinite uncountable prices, it is not feasible nor necessary to consider every possibility, as individuals cannot operate on an infinite domain. However, Murphy believes that central planning must take into account all potential prices and goods/ services, even those that do not exist yet. This debate raises fundamental questions of efficiency and the trade-off between comprehensive planning and practicality. It highlights the complexities associated with economic decision-making and the challenges of creating an optimal planning system."," While the question of considering all possible prices and goods/ services when making economic decisions may seem daunting, it remains a critical issue in planning the economy.

However, Murphy contends that central planning must take into account all potential prices and goods/ services, even those that do not exist yet. The debate raises questions on the role of availability of information, the trade-off between comprehensiveness and practicality, and the challenges of developing an optimal planning system. These issues underscore the complexities of economic decision-making and the importance of understanding the underlying factors that influence planning the economy."
" In a market economy where private property rights are held by individuals, their preferences are expressed through the limited exchanges they can make based on the finite amount of possessions they own. On the other hand, in a collective property regime, individuals express unlimited preferences, and the central planning unit must consider all of these preferences to derive prices based on the total amount of resources available. This is because the planner tries to mimic market processes, which requires taking into account all the virtually infinite preferences of individuals. As a result, an infinite set of prices is derived, which is in line with the theory of subjective value."," Private property in a market economy limits individual preferences to the finite amount of possessions they own, which they exchange on the market. In contrast, collective property regimes provide individuals the freedom to express an unlimited number of preferences, which the central planning unit must take into account while deducing prices. By mimicking the market process, the planner has to consider all the virtually infinite preferences and resources to derive prices. Therefore, the resulting set of prices is infinite, which aligns with the theory of subjective value."," The expression of individual preferences in a market economy is tied to their private property rights and the finite amount of possessions they own. In contrast, a collective property regime allows individuals to express an unlimited number of preferences. The planner or central planning unit must account for all these preferences while deducing prices, which mimics the market process. Taking into account virtually infinite preferences and resources leads to an infinite set of prices according to the theory of subjective value. These prices provide insights into the demand and supply of goods and services in the economy."
" Although the first question remains unanswered, there are certainly abundant possibilities of prices due to the unlimited potential of individuals expressing their preferences. While it may not be proven that it is an entirely infinite and uncountable range, the vast range of possible individual preferences implies that it could be close to being infinite. The key point to note is that preference is largely a subjective matter, and there are likely to be multiple price points that cater to individual preferences. The only way to truly understand the range of possible prices is to approach it from the perspective of the individual consumer."," Although the first question has yet to provide a definitive response, it is clear that the list of prices is not finite due to the endless potential of individual preferences. While it might not be an infinite and uncountable range of prices, it is undoubtedly open-ended. The variability of prices reflects the subjectivity of preferences, and as such, there are possibly countless price points to choose from. One should consider the different approaches a consumer may take when selecting among the available options. For example, some may place a high value on the aesthetics of a product, while others may prioritize functionality. Ultimately, the complex range of individual preferences results in a near-infinite list of possible prices."," We are yet to provide an unambiguous answer to the initial query about the infinite and uncountable list of prices. However, we can affirm that there is an infinite range of potential individual preferences, resulting in an essentially limitless prospective range of prices. The sheer number of possible variations in taste is the vital factor that justifies the notion of a practically infinite selection of prices. In plain terms, humans have different views, and as such there is bound to be a vast and fluctuating arrangement of prices to cater for these differences. There is a possibility that the list is not wholly uncountable, but the number of prices available is undoubtedly boundless. This further emphasizes the need to consider individual preferences when exploring the vast diversity in prices."
" Using Cantor's diagonal argument, it is possible to prove that the set of all the prices that the planner needs to take into account is not only infinite but also uncountable. This is done by assuming that each good and its corresponding price are defined using a set or subset of preferences. Additionally, it is already established that the set of all potential preferences of individuals is infinite (p1, p2...pn). The diagonal argument can then be applied to create a subset of preferences that differ from all other sets of preferences. This involves changing each ""Yes"" to ""No"" and each ""No"" to ""Yes"" along the diagonal. An infinite number of new subsets of preferences can be generated in this way, making it impossible to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all subsets of preferences and the set of natural numbers. Hence, the number of subsets of preferences used for defining prices of goods forms an uncountable infinite set (Table III)."," Cantor's diagonal argument can be used to demonstrate that the set of prices that the planner must consider is not only infinite but also uncountable. This argument is based on two premises: first, that each good and its corresponding price are defined using a set or subset of preferences, and second, that the set of all potential preferences of individuals is infinite (p1, p2...pn). By applying the method of changing each ""Yes"" to ""No"" and each ""No"" to ""Yes"" along the diagonal, it is possible to create a new subset of preferences that is unlike any existing or future subsets of preferences. This generates an infinite number of new subsets of preferences, making it impossible to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all subsets of preferences and the set of natural numbers. Therefore, the number of subsets of preferences used for defining prices of goods forms an uncountable infinite set (Table III)."," Through Cantor's diagonal argument, it can be shown that the set of prices that the planner must consider is not only infinite but also uncountable. This argument utilizes two premises; firstly, that each good and its corresponding price are defined using a set or subset of preferences and secondly, that the set of all potential preferences of individuals is infinite (p1, p2...pn). Applying the method of changing each ""Yes"" to ""No"" and each ""No"" to ""Yes"" along the diagonal creates a new subset of preferences that is unique from all other existing or future subsets of preferences. This generates an infinite number of new subsets of preferences, leading to an inability to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all subsets of preferences and the set of natural numbers. Therefore, the number of subsets of preferences used in defining prices of goods forms an uncountable infinite set (Table III)."
" Solving the problem of preferences cannot be achieved solely through the consumer goods market. Even if the consumer preferences are finite, there still remains the problem of an infinite uncountable set of preferences from managers and entrepreneurs. Despite this, the market often sees products that are not specifically requested by consumers being supplied by managers and entrepreneurs. This indicates that investment preferences of entrepreneurs are limited to the capital they possess. However, in a planned economy, the central planning unit has another problem of defining the prices of intermediate goods with an infinite uncountable set of prices to consider. As a case in point, The Matrix by the Wachowski brothers was not produced due to the demand of consumers."," The issue of satisfying the infinite uncountable set of preferences cannot be solved solely by the consumer goods market. Furthermore, even if consumer preferences were finite, the issue remains as managers and entrepreneurs possess their own infinite uncountable set of preferences. Due to this reason, there may be cases where entrepreneurs create products that are not directly requested by consumers, indicating that investments conducted by entrepreneurs are limited by the capital they possess. In a planned economy, the central planning unit also faces problems in pricing intermediate goods, as it has to deal with an infinite uncountable set of prices. For instance, The Matrix written by the Wachowski brothers was not written to cater to the demands of consumers."," The consumer goods market is not a complete solution to the problem of the infinite uncountable set of preferences. Even if consumer preferences are finite, managers and entrepreneurs hold their infinite uncountable set of preferences, posing problems on investment preferences. It is common for entrepreneurs to supply products that are not necessarily requested by consumers, indicating pre-existing investment preferences influenced by limited capital. On the other hand, a planned economy's central planning unit struggles with defining prices of intermediate goods that can fulfill infinite uncountable sets of prices. As an example, one can take The Matrix written by the Wachowski brothers, which was not created in response to consumer demand."
" In the classical economic calculation debate, Lange put forward the argument that, in order to determine the prices of intermediate goods, the planner must rely on market prices for consumer goods. On this basis, he believed that central planning could determine the prices of intermediate goods. However, von Mises challenged this argument, stating that the same problem would occur at the intermediate goods level as at the level of consumer goods. von Mises explained that the prices of intermediate goods are not determined by a technical method, as the production factors are neither fully specific nor fully non-specific, and there are numerous ways to produce final goods using intermediate goods. Despite relying partly on individual preferences for final goods, entrepreneurs ultimately bid for different quantities of intermediate goods to establish prices. The market prices for intermediate goods assist entrepreneurs in finding the most profitable solution. Therefore, the planner will face the same obstacle at the intermediate goods level as they did with consumer goods."," One of the key arguments in the economic calculation debate was put forth by Lange, who believed that the planner must rely on market prices for consumer goods to ultimately determine the prices of intermediate goods.

" The exploration of Murphy's arguments in this paper led us to introduce Cantor's theorem from set theories to refine and reshape our argument. We proposed that in a planned economy, a computational model must consider an uncountably infinite set of equations and prices.

" In this study, the researchers focus on the impact of economic expectations on political attitudes amidst a worldwide economic crisis that took place between 2008-2009. The study takes into account how citizens' exposure to economic news coverage and the content of such news could alter their prospective economic assessments during a time of crisis. This study stands out since much of the prior research that investigated information effects on economic evaluations occurred during more stable periods. By using a three-wave panel study and media content analysis, the researchers provide a unique and dynamic assessment of media influences on changes in economic evaluations during this severe crisis. The results of the study demonstrate that compared to the personal economic expectations of individuals, media exposure had a more significant influence on expectations regarding the future development of the national economic situation. Moreover, the researchers found that an increased dependence on media could cause a magnified effect on media exposure. The authors of this study emphasize the need for a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between personal and national economic evaluations and the implications for mass-mediated economic information."," This study investigates the dynamics of citizens' economic expectations during the 2008-2009 global economic crisis, in particular, the impact of media exposure on economic evaluations.

While previous studies have focused on the influence of media coverage on assessments of the national economy, this study seeks to examine the media's effect on assessments of personal economic expectations. The researchers propose that mediated information largely shapes evaluations of the national economy, but it remains to be seen whether this holds true for personal economic assessments."," Economic expectations of citizens are shaped by a variety of factors, such as personal experience, interpersonal communication, and media coverage of the economy. The present study merely examines the role of media coverage in shaping citizens' economic expectations during times of crisis. Additionally, the study aims to determine how this influence varies between a person's individual economic situation and the economic situation of the entire nation. Despite previous research focusing on the impact of media coverage solely on national economic assessments, this study aims to enrich academic discourse by pinpointing the effects of media on both national and personal economic expectations. Although it is speculated that the national economy is primarily influenced by mediated information, the results remain to be seen in terms of personal economic evaluations."," Citizens' economic expectations are shaped by various factors, including their personal experience, interpersonal communication, and the information they receive from the media about the economy. This study is focused on analyzing the effects of media coverage on citizens' economic expectations during times of crisis. The study also seeks to determine which kinds of economic expectations are affected by the media. While previous research has primarily examined the influence of media coverage on assessments of the national economy, this study takes a more granular approach by looking at both national and personal economic expectations. Previous research has suggested that citizens' assessments of the national economy are largely shaped by the media, but this study aims to shed light on how the media influences personal economic expectations as well."
" The research delves into how citizens' evaluations evolve over time, adopting a cautious approach to estimating the role of information. Additionally, the study integrates insights from previous research on political communication that suggest the strength of media effects varies across different audience segments (McLeod et al, 2002). By linking media coverage indicators to various types of economic assessments through an amalgamation of media content and survey data, and by investigating the potential moderating effect of news dependence on media outcomes, the research enhances our understanding of the interactions between economic media coverage and citizens' evaluations."," This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how citizens' evaluations change over time and how the information they receive influences their perception. Drawing from existing research in political communication, the study acknowledges that the impact of media coverage may vary across different audience demographics. To explore this further, the study integrates data from media sources and surveys to create a more nuanced understanding of how media coverage and economic assessments are related. Additionally, the study investigates how news dependency may moderate media effects, offering a more in-depth comprehension of how media interacts with citizens' evaluations."," The purpose of this research is to investigate changes in citizens' evaluations over time while focusing on the role of information in this process. Based on previous studies that have shown that the impact of media can differ across audience segments, the study takes a nuanced approach to examining the relationship between media coverage and economic assessments. By incorporating survey data and media content, the study aims to provide a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of how media and economic assessments interact. Furthermore, the study considers the potential moderating effect of news dependency on media effects. Overall, this research conveys a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between media, economic assessments, and citizens' evaluations."
" Research into the economic expectations of citizens in established democracies has predominantly focused on collecting data when economic conditions are relatively stable. However, this study breaks from convention by examining the perceptions of citizens when their economic prospects are deteriorating at an alarming speed. During times of economic uncertainty, individuals may seek out information to alleviate their unease, a phenomenon described as information-seeking behavior. To compound the impact of the unfavorable economy, media attention and coverage may further stress the importance of economic information dissemination."," Previous research conducted on the economic outlook of citizens in established democracies has largely been centered around times of steady economic growth. This study offers a fresh perspective by examining the perceptions of individuals during times of rapid economic decline. Individuals usually experience uncertainty about their financial status during economic crises, which can prompt them to seek out relevant information. In addition, the media's emphasis on economic downturns can further emphasize the significance of easily understood economic information during times of crisis."," The majority of research on the economic expectations of citizens in established democracies has been carried out during times of economic stability. However, this study departs from the norm by examining the sentiment of individuals during periods of rapid and unequivocal economic deterioration. It is common for individuals to experience doubt about their economic future during uncertain times, which can lead them to engage in information-seeking behavior. Furthermore, during times of economic crisis, media coverage can emphasize the value of mass-mediated economic information. This can intensify the influence of the media on economic perceptions."
" There is a school of thought among rational choice theorists that suggests citizens will not be completely informed about the state of the economy, and that it is okay for them to be ""rationally ignorant"" about current events (Downs, 1957). Even so, empirical research has revealed that during election periods, citizens do exhibit substantial knowledge about economic indicators like unemployment rates (Paldam and Nannestad, 2000). That being said, it is also important to note that citizens' assessments of economic conditions may not always be accurate due to several reasons (Hetherington, 1996). Firstly, different people evaluate economic conditions based on different criteria (Kinder et al, 1989). Secondly, political bias may lead citizens to perceive economic conditions as better or worse based on their preferred party's standing (Kramer, 1983; Wlezien et al, 1997; Van der Eijk et al, 2007). Lastly, this study primarily focuses on understanding how the media influences citizens' perceptions of the economy by comparing the different sources used by citizens to form their evaluations."," According to rational choice theorists, it is unreasonable to expect citizens to be completely informed about the state of the economy, just as they tend to remain ""rationally ignorant"" about general current affairs (Downs, 1957). However, there is empirical evidence that many citizens do have a significant degree of knowledge when it comes to economic matters, such as their country's unemployment rate, particularly around election time (Paldam and Nannestad, 2000). Nevertheless, citizens' perceptions of the economy may not always be accurate, and there could be several explanations for this (Hetherington, 1996). Firstly, citizens may use different criteria to evaluate the state of their economy (Kinder et al, 1989). Secondly, partisanship may play a role in citizens' perceptions, causing them to see economic conditions in a more favorable light if their preferred political party is in power (Kramer, 1983; Wlezien et al, 1997; Van der Eijk et al, 2007). Finally, this particular study focuses on how different sources of information from mass media impact citizens' evaluations of the economy."," Rational choice theorists argue that it is not rational for citizens to have complete knowledge of the economic state, as they remain ""rationally ignorant"" about current events in general (Downs, 1957). Still, many citizens exhibit vast knowledge regarding economic matters, especially the unemployment rate, during election campaigns, according to empirical research (Paldam and Nannestad, 2000). Nevertheless, citizens' perceptions or expectations of the economy may not be entirely precise as there are several reasons for which they may veer away from reality (Hetherington, 1996). The first reason is that various citizens deploy different criteria to evaluate the economic situation (Kinder et al, 1989). The second reason relates to partisanship (Kramer, 1983), such that citizens' perceptions may depend on which political party is in power, as indicated by (Wlezien et al, 1997; Van der Eijk et al, 2007). Lastly, the study particularly emphasizes how the mass media performs the central role of providing information that influences citizens' assessments of the economy."
" The mental economy, which refers to how people perceive and evaluate the economy, has become a popular subject in research focusing on the political impact of the economic climate. Researchers have taken an interest in how the mass media plays a role in influencing citizens' economic perceptions and mediating their voting behavior. Previous studies have shown that subjective evaluations of the economy were more successful in explaining voting outcomes than objective indicators, which suggests that there is some level of distortion between the actual economic climate and the public's perception of it. For instance, the economic situation in the US had reportedly improved before the 1992 presidential elections, but the mass media continued to report negative information about the economy. Researchers argued that Clinton's victory in that election was a result of people's perceived economic situation being more influential than the real economic situation. Similar observations were made regarding the 1998 German Bundestag election and the 2001 UK General election."," The subjective economy refers to how citizens perceive and evaluate the economic climate and has increasingly become a topic of interest in research studying the intersection of politics and economics. One area of focus has been on the role that mass media plays in shaping individuals' economic views and how this impacts their voting behavior. Researchers have found that subjective assessments of the economy, rather than objective indicators, have been successful in explaining voting outcomes, suggesting that there may be some discrepancy between the perceived and actual state of the economy. Hetherington's investigation into the 1992 US Presidential election showed that the US economy had recovered before the election, yet negative mass-mediated information about the economy continued to be circulated. This research suggested that Clinton's win was based more on the public's perceived economic climate than the reality of the state of the economy. Similar scenarios occurred during the 2001 UK General election and the 1998 German Bundestag election."," The subjective economy, which pertains to how individuals assess and judge the economic mood, has garnered much attention in studies that explore the political impact of the economy. The role of the mass media in shaping popular economic perceptions and influencing election outcomes has been a central subject in such research. Scholars have found that subjective evaluations of the economy, rather than objective measures, have been instrumental in explaining voting patterns, pointing toward potential distortions between public understandings of the economy and the actual conditions. For instance, ahead of the 1992 US presidential election, the economy reportedly recovered, yet the media remained pessimistic in reporting the state of the economy. Researchers suggest that this discrepancy may have led to a victory for Clinton, driven more by the public's perceived economic situation than the actual situation. Comparable observations were made in relation to the 2001 UK General election and the 1998 German Bundestag election."
" The influence of media on economic assessments has received considerable attention in research, particularly in macro-level analyses. Researchers have found varying results concerning media's impacts on public assessments. For instance, Mosley's (1984) time-series study showed that media estimates of the economic situation held greater predictive power over economic assessments than official economic indicators. Meanwhile, Sanders et al. (1993) and Goidel and Langley (1995) found that the tone of economic news coverage has an impact on public assessments in the UK and US, respectively. However, Soroka's (2006) more recent research emphasizes that only negative news coverage has an impact on public evaluations. Although some studies, such as Haller and Norpoth's (1997) and Wu et al.'s (2000), have found no influence of economic news on assessments."," The role of media in shaping public economic assessments has been the focus of various macro-level research studies. Mosley's (1984) study demonstrated that media's estimations of the economic situation were better predictors of economic assessments than official economic indicators. Similarly, Sanders et al. (1993) and Goidel and Langley (1995) found that the tone of economic news coverage impacted public assessments in the UK and US, respectively. More recent research by Soroka (2006) indicates that negative economic news coverage has a more significant effect on public evaluations. However, Wu et al.'s (2000) findings didn't show a notable impact of economic news on assessments. Similarly, Haller and Norpoth's (1997) research only found a minor effect of media coverage on assessments."," The relationship between media coverage and public assessments of the economy has been examined by researchers on a macro-level.

Other studies, such as Wu et al.'s (2000) and Haller and Norpoth's (1997), highlight no or a minor impact of economic news on assessments."
" The authors posit that media effects are more likely to manifest in assessments of the national economy rather than evaluations of personal economic situations. The economy is a significant issue that is often observable through unemployment, rising costs of living or bankruptcies in local businesses. However, national economic developments are often difficult to perceive first-hand and require the aid of media or social interactions to become recognized. Mutz (1992) states that perceptions of unemployment as a personal problem are predominantly derived from personal experience, while exposure to newspaper coverage of unemployment identifies it as a social problem."," The authors' argument is centered on the idea that media effects are more probable in the context of national economic evaluations, as opposed to individual or personal economic situations. The economy is a conspicuous subject for many people, and citizens can discern its impacts on their immediate surroundings through job losses, rising costs of living, or local business closures. However, it is challenging to determine the broader developments of the national economy without the aid of media or social interactions, making it an unobtrusive issue. According to Mutz (1992), personal experiences with unemployment have a significant influence on the way it is perceived as a personal problem, while newspaper coverage of unemployment highlights it as a societal issue."," In their argument, the authors propose that media effects are more likely to occur in evaluations of the national economy, rather than individual economic circumstances. While the economy is an observable issue, with tangible impacts such as job loss and increased living costs, it can be difficult to understand national economic developments. Therefore, relying on media and social interactions is essential to developing an awareness of national economic conditions. Mutz's (1992) research found that personal experience with unemployment shapes perceptions of it as a personal issue, while media coverage of unemployment increases awareness of it as a social issue."
" It is important to consider how the media portrays economic news, particularly with regards to positive and negative coverage. Studies show that humans tend to pay more attention to negative information compared to positive information, and this is also reflected in the field of political communication, where negative information tends to have a stronger impact on public opinion dynamics. Moreover, classic persuasion studies suggest that negativity and threat frames are more prevalent in media coverage. Recent research in media and the economy suggest that individuals are more likely to pick up negative information about the economy, which means that negative economic news will be more impactful than positive economic news. Thus, understanding these differences can help us understand how the public perceives and understands economic news."," The effects of positive versus negative economic news coverage on public opinion is an important consideration that demands focus. Psychological studies reveal that people tend to display a greater attentiveness towards negative information as compared to positive information, thus increasing the possibility of them drawing on negativity when forming an opinion. Previous researches in the field of political communication also confirm that negative information tends to have stronger effects on public opinion dynamics, as indicated by threat and risk frames. Classic persuasion studies also report a higher prevalence of threats and negativity. Recent insights from media and the economy suggest that individuals are more liable to consume negative information about the economy, implicating that negative economic news is more likely to leave a resounding impact than positive economic news. Consequently, it is crucial to assess these differences to understand how the public perceives and reacts to economic news."," Examining how positive or negative economic news coverage affects public opinion is crucial. Research shows that people are more predisposed to negative information than positive information, as they are more likely to pay attention to it and use it to form opinions. Negative information has a stronger impact on public opinion, a finding backed up by previous research in political communication in which risk and threat frames are often used to convey negative information. Classic persuasion studies also report higher levels of threats and negativity. Recent studies on media and the economy suggest that people are more inclined to consume negative rather than positive information, indicating that negative economic news is likely to have a greater impact than positive economic news. As such, understanding these differences is essential to understand how economic news is perceived and processed by the public."
" The widespread belief that mass media impacts everyone equally has come under scrutiny by scholars studying political communication (such as Delli Carpini in 2004). Our study focuses on how media affects economic assessments, taking into account the level of dependency individuals have on the news for interpretation and understanding of their surroundings. Media system dependency theory (abbreviated as MD) suggests that the impact of media messages is largely dependent on how much people rely on the media for information. Self-reported dependency on mass-mediated information plays a significant role in the effects of mass communication on personal and impersonal perceptions, according to researchers Morton and Duck in 2001. Experimental research on health communication effects has also provided further support for this theory."," The assumption that mass media affects all citizens in the same way is often regarded as nave, and recent research in political communication has shed light on the contingency of media effects (as highlighted by McLeod et al in 2002 and Walgrave and Van Aelst in 2006). Our study investigates how individuals' reliance on mass media shapes their economic assessments. Media system dependency theory (MD) argues that the extent to which people depend on the news to understand their surroundings is a pivotal factor in determining the impact of news coverage on their opinions and evaluations. MD theory is premised on the idea that media messages have varying impacts depending on how much those exposed to them rely on the media. The theory's initial support has been strengthened by several experimental studies focussing on health communication. Morton and Duck's (2001) analysis highlights how self-reported dependency on mediated information moderates the impact of mass communication on both personal and impersonal perceptions."," While it was once commonly believed that mass media content impacts all people equally, political communication research has shown otherwise (for example, Delli Carpini in 2004). Our study contributes to the growing attention paid to the contingency of media effects on economic assessments. The extent to which individuals depend on media to make sense of their surroundings is a critical element in measuring media's impact on opinions and evaluations. Media system dependency theory (MD) suggests that the level of dependency people have on the news for informational goals determines whether news coverage will impact their perceptions. Several studies have indicated that the impact of media messages is more profound when people are heavily dependent on the media (Ball-Rokeach et al in 1984, for example). Morton and Duck's (2001) research on health communication effects found that self-reported dependency on mediated information moderated the impact of mass communication on both personal and impersonal perceptions."
" The current study is centered on investigating the correlation between the media and the public's economic assessments. In particular, we are interested in exploring the impact that the tone of media reporting, such as mass-mediated projections of future economic trends, may have on individuals' societal economic evaluations. Our objective is to build upon previous research, like Soroka (2006), to better understand the extent to which media reporting tone can influence how people assess their economic well-being in a future-focused and collective sense."," This study aims to examine the relationship between media and individuals' economic evaluations. Specifically, we seek to investigate how the tone of economic reporting, particularly in the form of mass-mediated future economic forecasts, may potentially impact people's prospective and public economic assessments. In doing so, we aim to expand on prior literature, such as Soroka (2006), to gain a deeper understanding of the role that media reporting tone plays in the formation of collective economic evaluations."," The focus of this research is to explore the connection between media exposure and the way people assess the state of the economy.

" Employing a combination of a content analysis of news outlets and a three-wave panel survey data, we explore the previously formed expectations. Participants were questioned about their degree of exposure to media outfits that were analyzed for content. By merging survey data and media content, we can evaluate the type of economic information that people were exposed to over time and how this exposure affected alterations in their economic outlook."," A news content analysis and a three-wave panel survey data were employed to investigate the expectations that were formulated earlier. Participants were asked about their exposure to the outlets that underwent content analysis and their degree of exposure. By amalgamating survey data and media content, we can examine the economic information that individuals were exposed to over time, which allowed us to study how this exposure impacted the changes in their economic outlook."," To address the expectations articulated earlier, we utilized a three-wave panel survey data and a news content analysis. Participants reported their level of exposure to the media outlets that underwent content analysis.

" Due to logistical restrictions, we had to rely on a smaller pool of media sources in the second period, but the descriptive data suggests a considerable degree of agreement between the outlets. In particular, two of the three most negative sources identified in the initial period were still among the most negative in the second period (Metro period 1: -2, NRC Handelsblad period 1: -1.78, Metro period 2: -2, NRC Handelsblad period 2: -1.69). Moreover, in the first period, nine of the eleven outlets fell between -1 and -2 in terms of national economic evaluations, a trend that was consistent in seven out of the eight outlets evaluated in the second period. Additionally, we performed a separate analysis of the first period using only the outlets that were available in the second period, which produced very similar results. This gives us confidence that the more limited selection of outlets we used in the second period was sufficient for our purposes."," Practical limitations necessitated the use of only a smaller number of media sources in the second phase, but the descriptive statistics suggest a considerable degree of correspondence across the outlets. For example, two of the three outlets that were most negative in the first period were still the most negative in the second period (Metro period 1: -2, NRC Handelsblad period 1: -1.78, Metro period 2: -2, NRC Handelsblad period 2: -1.69). Furthermore, in the first period, nine out of eleven outlets identified for national economic assessments fell within the range of -1 to -2, and this trend was consistent for seven out of eight outlets in the second period. We also replicated the analyses for the first period using only those outlets that were also available in the second period, and the findings were highly similar. Given these similarities, we are confident that the more limited range of outlets used in the second phase was sufficient for our purposes."," As a result of practical constraints, we had to rely on a smaller pool of media outlets for the second period, but the descriptive findings indicate a noteworthy degree of similarity across sources. For instance, two of the three initially identified most negative media outlets remained the most negative in the second period (Metro period 1: -2, NRC Handelsblad period 1: -1.78, Metro period 2: -2, NRC Handelsblad period 2: -1.69). Furthermore, in the first period, nine out of eleven media sources were classified within the range of -1 to -2 for national economic evaluations, and this was found in seven out of eight media sources in the second period.

As such, we are confident that our more limited pool of media outlets in the second period sufficed for our purposes."
" The data used for testing the hypotheses is derived from a three-wave panel survey that examines Dutch citizens' voting eligibility. A cohort of 2,400 individuals aged over 17 is selected randomly from the online panel of 143,809 citizens and requested to complete an online questionnaire. Out of the 2,400 individuals, 58% or 1,394 of the participants submitted completed questionnaires (RR1). Our analysis of the census data from the Dutch electorate reveals that the sample underrepresents specific groups, such as men (47.0% vs. 49.4%), young citizens (30.8% vs. 34.2%), and individuals with intermediate vocational education (31.3% vs. 48.0%)."," To test the hypotheses, we gathered data from a three-wave panel survey of eligible Dutch voters. We selected a random group of 2,400 individuals aged 17 or older from an online panel of 143,809 citizens and invited them to complete a digital questionnaire. Approximately 58% or 1,394 of the individuals responded (RR1). We compared this sample to the Dutch electorate census data and found that men (47.0% vs. 49.4%), younger citizens (30.8% vs. 34.2%), and individuals with intermediate vocational education (31.3% vs. 48.0%) were underrepresented in our panel."," Our hypotheses were tested using data collected from a three-wave panel survey of individuals eligible to vote in the Netherlands.

After comparing our sample data with census data from the Dutch electorate, we observed that there was underrepresentation of men (47.0% vs. 49.4%), young citizens (30.8% vs. 34.2%), and those with intermediate vocational education (31.3% vs. 48.0%)."
" To validate the hypotheses, we carry out numerous OLS regression analyses. Each of the sociotropic and egocentric outlooks are represented by four models, where economic expectations at t2 and t3 are the response variables, while the previously mentioned factors are the predictor variables. The economic evaluations at t1 and t2 are taken into account as controls. We use the lagged term to focus on the disparity between the two panel waves, and integrating prior economic evaluations diminishes the risk of the models being insufficient. The inclusion of the lagged term is consistent with Markus's (1979) methodology."," To evaluate our hypotheses, we adopt various OLS regression analyses. Four models for sociotropic and egocentric expectations are presented, which relate the economic expectations at t2 and t3 with the factors mentioned earlier, while regulating economic expectations at t1 or t2. The use of a lagged variable concentrates on the changes of the dependent variable between two panel waves, which is akin to the approach taken by Markus (1979). Subsequently, incorporating prior economic assessments as controls helps prevent the model from being underspecified, as the predictors of static economic evaluations are included in the lagged term."," In order to validate our hypotheses, we conduct several OLS regression analyses, presenting four models each for sociotropic and egocentric expectations. The models relate economic expectations at t2 and t3 with the independent variables mentioned earlier, while adjusting for economic expectations at t1 or t2. The inclusion of a lagged variable emphasizes the disparity between the two panel waves, and this approach is similar to that of Markus (1979). Furthermore, incorporating prior economic assessments serves as a control for static economic evaluations, thus reducing the risk of underspecification for our models."
" The results of our study reveal an intriguing pattern, in which we observe no correlation between sociotropic expectations and personal economic circumstances but a partial relationship between egocentric expectations and household income. The latter can be viewed as an indirect measure of an individual's financial well-being. These findings imply that citizens draw on diverse sources of information, which could be either their own experiences or media exposure, to shape their economic expectations, depending on the type of expectation they hold."," Our study highlights an interesting trend, whereby changes in sociotropic expectations appear unrelated to personal economic circumstances, while changes in egocentric expectations are somewhat associated with household income. Household income serves as a proxy for assessing an individual's financial situation. Consequently, our findings suggest that citizens rely on different sources of information - personal exposure or mass media - to create dissimilar economic expectations. This reinforces the idea that individuals may form expectations influenced by numerous factors, both internal and external, to their lived experiences."," Our study's results reveal an intriguing phenomenon - we observed no link between sociotropic expectations and personal economic circumstances, while egocentric expectations demonstrated a partial link to household income. Household income acts as a substitute measure to determine an individual's economic status, and these findings imply that citizens obtained diverse information from either their own experiences or the media to shape expectations. This highlights that individuals may form expectations from multiple factors - internal or external to their own experiences - that ultimately influence their economic perceptions."
" The aggregate level's egocentric expectations remained nearly unchanged during the time we conducted our study. Interestingly, despite the major financial crisis that occurred, the majority of people surveyed believed their personal financial situation would not be negatively impacted. This opinion was prevalent not only among the Dutch but also throughout Europe, as documented by Eurobarometer 71. Some possible explanations for this phenomenon include a lack of experience with financial difficulties, a general psychological resistance to believing that bad things could happen to them, and the fact that it takes some time for macroeconomic trends to affect individuals. Economists confirm that there is a delay between national economic developments and individual pocketbook considerations. In short, it appears as though people are unwilling to connect abstract macroeconomic data to their personal finance."," Throughout the duration of our study, the egocentric expectations on the aggregate level experienced minimal variation. It was observed that despite the severe financial crisis, the majority of people continued to perceive their personal financial situation as benign. This trend was prevalent beyond the realm of the Dutch population and was also noted throughout Europe in Eurobarometer 71. One speculation for the occurrence of this phenomenon is a lack of previous exposure to financial disasters. Alternatively, people's psychological disposition might discourage them from believing that they would be embroiled in any negative financial event. It might also be the case that there is a lag before macroeconomic changes are reflected in individual expenditures. Economists have observed that it takes time for national economic developments to affect individual pocketbooks. Ultimately, it is clear that the average person appears disinclined to link macro-level economic data with their personal financial decisions."," During the time of our study, the egocentric expectations at the aggregate level did not undergo significant modifications. What is remarkable is that even amidst an economic crisis of unprecedented proportion, people's views on their personal financial situation remained unperturbed. In fact, the majority of people still believed that their personal financial condition would remain unaffected even when they predicted the national economy would take a significant dip within a year. This trend was not specific to the Dutch population, but it was widespread across Europe. Eurobarometer 71 also registered a discrepancy in views concerning personal and national economics. One possible interpretation for this behavior is a lack of experience with severe economic crises. Additionally, it could be a general psychological inclination of people to believe that they are immune to bad things happening to them. It may also be the time for the crisis to impact the masses. It is especially possible that the latter interpretation has more weight, as economists concur that there is a delay before national economic changes impact individual financials. Ultimately, it appears that the average citizen does not correlate the theoretical realm of macro-financial statistics with their personal financial reality."
" While past studies have suggested that media coverage tends to have a negative impact on economic perceptions, our research did not find evidence of such a bias. This may be because the news coverage during our research period was consistently negative, so adding more negative stories did not significantly affect the independent variable. However, previous research only explored the macro-level picture of the issue, and it could be that the effects of media on individual economic assessments are different. Our study suggests that further research is needed to understand how media coverage affects economic perceptions during different economic climates. Specifically, research comparing economic growth to economic crises could help shed light on how media influences these perceptions."," Our findings contrast with prior research which found that media reporting on the economy tended to have a negative bias. However, our data did not support this conclusion, and we attribute this to the fact that during our research period, the media coverage was predominantly negative. As a result, the variance in the independent variable was minimally affected by adding more negative news to the mix. It is crucial to note, though, that existing studies only established this negativity bias at the macro-level, and we cannot determine whether similar conclusions hold at the individual level. Moreover, economic crises may have unique micro-level dynamics that could influence the way individuals respond to media coverage of the economy. Our results indicate that further inquiry in this area is necessary to better understand the complex relationship between media and economic perceptions."," Our research presents a contrasting view to prior studies which have indicated that media effects on economic perceptions tend to be negatively biased. However, our data did not support this conclusion (and we rejected H2), which we attribute to the fact that the news coverage was almost exclusively negative during our research period. As a result, adding more negative news into the equation was unlikely to have a significant impact on the independent variable. It is worth noting that the negativity bias had only been observed in macro-level research and it is possible that micro-level dynamics may operate differently, especially during times of economic crisis when the news environment may be heavily negative. Furthermore, our findings should not be over-generalized to times of overall positive economic news cycle, which requires a different effect estimation. Previous studies suggest that news effects are more significant when an economy is experiencing a crisis, though future studies should continue to explore the strength and variation of such media effects."
" The present study expands the pool of knowledge by taking the conditionality of news effects into account. Our findings support the idea that media dependency plays a vital role in moderating media impacts. Interestingly, we discovered that individuals who rely more heavily on the news are more susceptible to the effects of exposure to both positive and negative economic information, supporting our third hypothesis (H3). These results align with the research conducted by Ball-Rokeach et al (1984), indicating that media effects are most pronounced among individuals with high levels of dependency. To better understand the reasons behind why people rely on the media for information, future research should focus on factors outside of our current model. Besides, our results suggest that while outlet-specific exposure was crucial in the first period, media dependency had a direct impact on expectations in the second period."," This study contributes to the existing literature on news effects by considering the conditional factors involved. Our findings validate the hypothesis that media dependency is an essential moderator of media influences. Specifically, we found that the more someone relies on the news, the greater the impact of exposure to positive and negative economic information on economic expectations (supporting H3). These results are consistent with previous research conducted by Ball-Rokeach et al (1984), which suggests that individuals with the strongest media dependency are the most affected by media messages. In future studies, it is crucial to investigate factors beyond our present model to gain a better understanding of people's motives and media dependency for information. Interestingly, we discovered that the interaction between media dependency and positive/negative economic information was significant only in the first period. In contrast, media dependency had a direct impact on changing expectations in the second period, indicating that outlet-specific exposure was not as important for those who depend heavily on the news."," The current study offers new insights into news effects by taking into consideration the conditional factors involved. Our results indicate that media dependency is a crucial moderator of media influences, supporting the existing literature. We found that individuals who rely more heavily on the news are more susceptible to the impacts of both positive and negative economic information, thereby corroborating our third hypothesis (H3). These findings align with earlier research conducted by Ball-Rokeach et al (1984), which found that individuals with the highest dependency on the media experience the strongest effects on attitudes and behaviours. It is crucial to investigate factors beyond our present model to gain a more comprehensive understanding of people's motives and media dependency for information in future research.

" Despite these deficiencies, our analysis has contributed to advancing the comprehension of the circumstances that impact economic assessments, particularly concerning the role of news coverage. Being aware of the potential influence of media coverage on economic evaluations carries political implications. If an upbeat economic view leads to a higher probability of supporting a political party (as noted by Lewis-Beck and Paldam, 2000) and the opposite is true, then a negative portrayal of economic prospects in the media could be problematic for those in power. Furthermore, individuals with a more pessimistic outlook on future economic developments may decrease their consumption and subsequently weaken economic conditions, which could have a ripple effect. Although our research was conducted within a specific economic environment, its insights can be applied beyond the crisis we investigated."," Despite the limitations of our research, we have contributed to a better understanding of the dynamics that impact economic assessments, particularly regarding media coverage. It is important to recognize that the portrayal of the economy in the media can have political implications. For example, a positive economic outlook may increase the likelihood of voters supporting a certain political party (as shown by Lewis-Beck and Paladm, 2000), while a negative outlook may have the opposite effect. Moreover, if people who hold more negative economic expectations are less likely to consume, this could impact economic conditions and have a cascading effect. Although our study was conducted in a specific economic context, the lessons we have learned have application beyond the crisis we investigated."," Despite its limitations, our analysis has shed light on the economic evaluations and the role that media coverage plays in shaping them. The political implications of media-driven economic evaluations are worth noting.

" A knowledge-based economy relies heavily on the use and application of knowledge to produce goods and services. Thus, understanding the economic models used in such an economy, especially the financial system, is crucial. Failure in the financial system could have damaging effects on innovation and productivity. Given the complexity of societies, interdisciplinary approaches are more helpful than relying on a single social science discipline. In the early 2000s, mainstream economic theory failed to be a reliable foundation for financial regulation, but the economic discipline as a whole did not take this opportunity to develop a new paradigm. Rather, economic schools continued to argue with each other. This serves as a case study for scholars to reevaluate economic theory in a cross-disciplinary framework rather than in isolation. One such approach involves utilizing both exogenous and endogenous models from conflicting economic schools to help create a more comprehensive economic system."," The use of knowledge in the production of goods and services characterizes a knowledge economy. In order to properly understand the workings of such an economy, it is important to consider the relevant economic models, with particular emphasis on the financial system. This system is incredibly important as any failures within it can be detrimental to the economy at large. Due to the complexity of society, employing interdisciplinary methods is necessary when examining a knowledge economy. For instance, the failure of mainstream economic theory as a basis for financial regulation in the first decade of the 21st century highlights the need for rethinking economic theory. However, the lack of collaboration among different economic schools was unfortunate. To build a new and valid economic theory, reevaluating models from both exogenous and endogenous economic schools could be helpful. By implementing such interdisciplinary models, a more accurate and comprehensive view of the economic system can be achieved."," Within a knowledge economy, the production of goods and services involves the application of knowledge, making it crucial to understand the economic models that are relevant. The financial system is particularly important within a knowledge economy because its failure could hinder progress. To accurately understand such economies and their systems, interdisciplinary approaches are required as societies are complex and cannot be easily understood through any single social science discipline. The early 2000s was marked by mainstream economic theory's inability to serve as a reliable framework for financial regulation. However, the economic discipline did not utilize this opportunity to create a new and valid theory but instead continued to argue within themselves. To reexamine economic theory, conflicting economic schools can be used to produce exogenous and endogenous models for each subsystem of the economy. Employing interdisciplinary approaches can aid in creating a better economic system by considering various perspectives to achieve a comprehensive understanding."
" Looking back at the years following the financial crisis of 2008, there was evidence that economic theory was not able to accurately explain what was happening in reality. Economists were unable to agree on how to construct valid theory that would reflect actual events. While in science, theory is changed when it fails to explain empirical reality, the economics discipline did not follow this straightforward approach. Instead, economists debated on whether the market was empirically or only ideally perfect. Despite mainstream economic theory assuming a perfect market, the financial market was far from perfect, which was apparent in the limited tools available to Jean-Claude Trichet during the crisis."," The years following the 2008 financial crisis saw the failure of economics theory to explain what was happening in reality. There was no agreement among economists on how to construct valid theory, and a contentious debate ensued. The economic model of supply-demand-price equilibrium was based on the assumption of a perfect market, but the financial market was far from perfect. This reality was apparent as one economist expressed frustration that the available models were of limited help. This lack of conventional tools made it difficult for policymakers such as Jean-Claude Trichet to address the crisis."," The years following the financial crisis of 2008 represented a significant struggle for economists to construct valid theory that accurately reflected real-world data.

" In 2009, the economist Paul Krugman reflected on the state of economics and observed that there was a time when the discipline was highly regarded for its theoretical and practical successes.

" Despite division among macroeconomists, there are some who believe that free-market economies never stray from their intended path, while others believe occasional deviations from that path are possible yet manageable with the help of the powerful Federal Reserve. Unfortunately, neither school could predict or solve an economy that went dangerously off-course despite the Fed's best efforts. This lack of foresight left the profession with deep rifts, which widened even more in the wake of the financial crisis."," The economic community remains divided on the issue of whether free-market economies can remain steadfast or, eventually, stray from their intended trajectory. Some experts strongly argue against extended deviancies by believing that the all-powerful Fed can put things right. Others, however, are unsure and believe that the economy might still veer off track at times. Nevertheless, economists on either side were incapable of predicting or handling the fallout when the economy went haywire, even with the support of the Federal Reserve. This fundamental disagreement only became worse as the economic downturn began to take hold."," The issue of the stability of free-market economies continues to divide macroeconomists, with one side arguing against any possibility of straying while the other side acknowledges occasional off-track moments, albeit rectifiable by the Federal Reserve. Unfortunately, neither stance was equipped to handle an economy that strayed significantly despite the Fed's measures. As Krugman notes, these divisions have become more pronounced in the aftermath of the crisis. The profession needs to recognize the symptoms of a floundering economy and work towards comprehensive solutions that can be implemented before it is too late."
" Krugman provided an explanation as to why the fault line persisted in the economics profession; he called it ""aesthetic."" Economists were attracted to theories that had impressive-looking mathematics and were perceived as beautiful, and they mistook them for truth. Until the Great Depression of the 1930s, economists viewed capitalism as a perfect system or one that was close to perfect. With the onset of mass unemployment, this idealized vision proved to be unsustainable. However, as time passed, economists returned to this idealized view of the economy, which was embellished with fancy equations. This romanticized and sanitized perspective of the economy failed to consider the many things that could go wrong, such as human irrationality, institutional problems, market imperfections, and insufficient regulation by regulators. It resulted in a blind eye being turned towards these problems, causing the economy's operating system to undergo unpredictable crashes. (Krugman 2009)."," According to Krugman, the reason for the fault line's persistence in the economics profession is because economists mistakenly believed that beauty, when wrapped in impressive-looking mathematics, was synonymous with truth. Prior to the Great Depression, most economists regarded capitalism as a perfect system or one that was exceedingly close to perfection. However, in the face of mass unemployment the belief that the economy could not fail was quickly exposed as being untenable. Yet, over time, economists fell in love with the old, perfect system again, with added glitz and glamour through intricate formulae. Sadly, this romanticized and perfected vision of the economy led to a blindness to the numerous things that could go wrong. Economists turned a blind eye to the imperfections of human rationality which could ultimately result in the economy's failure. They also ignored the folly of institutions when they go wrong, the imperfections inherent in markets and particularly in financial markets, and the dangers posed by negligent regulators. (Krugman 2009)."," Krugman argues that the duration of the fault line in the economics profession was because economists viewed beauty wrapped up in impressive mathematics as truth. Most economists thought that capitalism was a perfect or almost perfect system before the Great Depression. This rosy view of the economy proved to be untenable when a mass of people became unemployed. But as the memories of the Great Depression faded over time, economists fell for the old, romanticized view of the markets, dressed up this time with fancy equations. This stylish and antiseptic image of the economy pushed the majority of economists to overlook all the possible issues that could arise. They turned a blind eye to the extent of human irrationality that could lead to economic bubbles and downturns, overlooked the problems related to institutions going wrong, discounted the market imperfections, especially the financial markets, that could result in unpredictable crashes, and ignored the perils of regulators who lack faith in their regulations.

" Neo-Keynesians had a varying opinion compared to economists from the Neo-Classical Synthesis School who had a narrow view of the economy as solely a production system.

Nevertheless, financial markets' existence becomes insignificant without the market frictions."
" According to Minsky, the time aspect was an essential component of an economic model. Keynes introduced the concept of time in his economic model in 1936 to incorporate finance as part of the model. By creating a model in which the price level of financial assets is determined in financial markets and the price of money is an asset derived from its liquidity, Keynes sought to create an economic model in which money is never neutral. Each capital and financial asset generates an income stream and has carrying costs with varying degrees of liquidity, which determine the price level of the assets. (Minsky 1993)"," Minsky argued that the introduction of a time element was crucial for an accurate economic model. Keynes had already incorporated such a factor in his work in 1936 to include finance in the model. Keynes aimed to create a dynamic economic model where money is never neutral to pricing by establishing a marketplace where the price level of financial assets was determined. Liquidity played a crucial role in deriving the value of money, and each capital or financial asset had different degrees of liquidity, which impacted their price level relative to income. (Minsky 1993)"," As per Minsky, the presence of a time variable in economic models was of utmost importance. This concept was already introduced by Keynes in 1936, wherein he incorporated finance as a part of the model. Keynes aimed to create an economic model where money did not remain neutral to pricing. He established a marketplace where the price level of financial assets was determined, and the liquidity of money played a vital role in determining its value. Each capital and financial asset generated an income stream with its handling costs and varying degrees of liquidity, which determined their price level. (Minsky 1993)"
" In a financial system based on Keynesian principles, the time factor plays a crucial role in determining how valuable a capital asset is. A capital asset is an investment that generates income and can be sold in the future. The present income stream that the asset produces and its future liquidity are two key concepts that demonstrate how the asset's value evolves over time. This temporal process from T1 (present income) to T2 (future liquidity) is partly based on exchanging credit and debt. Borrowing and lending represent the fundamental act in most capitalist economies. This often entails trading money in the present for money that must be paid back with interest and principal at a later stage. Minsky asserted that borrowers must convince lenders that they will be able to meet their future repayment obligations. (Minsky 1993)."," In a financial system that follows the principles of Keynes, time is a crucial variable in determining the worth of a capital asset. Capital assets are investments that generate income and can be sold at a later stage. Present-income and future liquidity are the two crucial concepts that define the value of a capital asset. The time dimension can be traced from the present-income (T1) that the asset generates to its future liquidity (T2) when it can be sold. The temporal process involved is facilitated through credit and debt transactions in a financial system. The foundation of most capitalist economies is based on borrowing and lending. Borrowers borrow money in the present that they must repay with interest and principal in the future. To do so, debtors must convince lenders that they can meet their future repayment obligations convincingly. (Minsky 1993)."," Time is a key factor in determining the value of a capital asset within a financial system that follows the principles of Keynes. Capital assets are investments that provide income over time and can be sold at a later point. The value of a capital asset is influenced by two concepts, present-income and future liquidity. Present-income refers to the income stream that the asset generates at present, while future liquidity refers to its expected value when sold in the future. Credit-debt transactions are the means by which this temporal process from T1 (present income) to T2 (future liquidity) occurs in the financial system. Borrowing and lending are fundamental to most capitalist economies, and they involve a trade of present money for future money that includes interest and principal. Borrowers must demonstrate to their lenders that they have the capability to honor their future repayment obligations convincingly. (Minsky 1993)."
" A financial system operates within a temporal dimension, with credit representing the past, present composed of interest payments, and the future consisting of debt repayment. Economic systems require a time dimension to account for this essential process, as per Keynesian theory. Financial markets provide liquidity by allocating a value to capital assets. The General Theory by Keynes illustrates that asset prices¡¯ levels derive from (financial) markets that establish the price of money as an asset with liquidity-based value. Capital assets, each consisting of an income stream, carrying costs, and differing degrees of liquidity, are used to determine the price level of assets. Future liquidity is offered for credit-debt contracts by financial markets, making them sellable in the future. Both present income and future liquidity are required to qualify as a capital asset."," The time dimension of financial systems includes credit as the past, interest payments as the present, and debt repayment as the future. Keynesian economic models acknowledge this temporal process as essential for financial success. Financial markets provide capital asset liquidity by giving them a set value. The General Theory by Keynes explains that asset prices¡¯ levels are determined in (financial) markets. There, the price of money is an asset, whose liquidity-related value is recognized, with each capital asset having an income stream, carrying costs, and a degree of liquidity. Asset price levels are determined by the relative value of income and liquidity over time. Financial markets are responsible for providing future liquidity, allowing credit-debt contracts to be sold in the future. A capital asset must possess two temporal characteristics: current income and future liquidity to be successful."," Financial systems work within a time context that encompasses credit as a past event, interest payments as a present occurrence, and debt repayment as a future obligation. Keynesian theories emphasize the significance of this temporal dimension in modeling economic systems. Financial markets affect liquidity by attributing a value to capital assets. Keynes' General Theory illustrates that the price level of financial assets is established in markets where the price of money is an asset whose value relates to its liquidity. Capital assets, each possessing an income stream, carrying costs, and varying levels of liquidity, are used to determine the price level of assets. Future liquidity is available for credit-debt contracts through financial markets, making them sellable in the future. Current income and future liquidity are two key temporal features a capital asset must possess."
" The Neo-Classical Synthesis School had a sharp focus on the production subsystem as the primary determinant of control. It believed that the present price of a commodity was the driving factor for this subsystem. The Neo-Keynesian School, on the other hand, focused more on the financial subsystem and held the view that the future price of capital assets controlled the financial subsystem. The challenge of modeling these disparate economic models lay in finding a complementary framework that could seamlessly integrate both theories. This could be accomplished by using a ""meta-framework"" methodology such as the one found in societal dynamics theory. A topological systems model for a society was utilized in this meta-framework wherein the economy represented an economic subsystem consisting of both production and financial sub-subsystems. More details on this societal systems model can be found in Betz (2011)."," The Neo-Classical Synthesis School of economic thought was primarily concerned with the production subsystem, wherein the key factor of control was the present price of a commodity. In contrast, the Neo-Keynesian School emphasized the financial subsystem with a focus on the future price of capital assets for control. Combining these two economic models into a complementary framework was a complex challenge. One way to approach it would be to use a ""meta-framework"" methodology such as the one seen in societal dynamics theory. This meta-framework conceptualizes society as a topological system model, with the economy as an economic subsystem consisting of both production and financial sub-subsystems. To learn more about this societal systems model, refer to Betz (2011)."," In the Neo-Classical Synthesis School, the focus was on the production subsystem, where the current commodity price played a vital role in determining control.

The process involves the topological systems model of society, with the economy as an economic subsystem containing both production and financial sub-subsystems. Further information about this societal systems model is present in Betz's (2011) work."
" A societal dynamics topology model portrays the stasis of a society, dividing its major systems into four types of subsystems - economic, cultural, political, and technological. These subsystems form a stacked plane structure. The conventional economic perspective views it as a composition of production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. A production system, financed by a financial system, generates goods and services from material and energy resources. A market consumes these goods and services. Therefore, every economic system is partitioned into four subsystems consisting of production, market, finance, and resources. The larger societal context can accommodate the exogenous school's production model within it as the production subsystem of the economic system. The endogenous school's financial system can also fit within this as the financial subsystem of the economic plane."," In the realm of societal dynamics, a topological model provides an overview of a society's state, with the major systems being divided into four categories, such as economic, cultural, political, and technological. These systems are represented in a stacked plane structure similar to Fig. 4 of the model. From an economic perspective, an economy consists of production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. A financial system funds the production subsystem, which produces goods and services using material and energy resources. The market subsystem, in turn, consumes these goods and services. As a result, any economic system can be divided into four subsystems: production, market, finance, and resources. The exogenous school's economy production model can be considered as the production subsystem of the economic system, while the endogenous school's financial system can be viewed as the financial subsystem of the economic plane in the broader societal context.","When analyzing societal dynamics, a topological model can be used to depict the various subsystems of an industrialized society, which include cultural, economic, political, and technological systems. These systems can be displayed in a stacked plane arrangement such as shown in Figure 4. Meanwhile, conventional economic theories encompass production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. Economic production involves the utilization of financial resources to convert material and energy resources into products and services.The generated commodities and services can then be procured through the market subsystem. Thus, any economic system can be separated into four subsystems consisting of production, market, finance, and resources. Furthermore, the exogenous school¡¯s model of an economy production system can be placed within this broader societal context as the production subsystem of the economic system, while the endogenous school¡¯s model of an economic financial system can be understood as the financial subsystem of the economic plane."
" Our objective is to establish a cohesive model of the societal economic subsystem by connecting fragmented economic models from the endogenous and exogenous schools. In order to accomplish this, we will utilize models from other social science disciplines and devise a revolutionary interdisciplinary system. This new model will expand our comprehension of the socio-economic environment and assist in developing forward-thinking economic policies."," The integration of partial economic models from the endogenous and exogenous schools is crucial to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the societal economic subsystem. We will rely on various models from other social sciences to construct a cross-disciplinary economic system. By creating a unified model, we will elucidate the complex interplay of various economic factors and improve our ability to predict future economic trends. This, in turn, will enable us to design more effective economic policies that are in tune with the needs of society."," To develop an all-encompassing model of the societal economic subsystem, we need to amalgamate fragmented economic models originating from different schools of thought. With this objective in mind, we will incorporate models from other social sciences and establish a comprehensive multidisciplinary framework. Our aim is to apprehend the intricate workings of society and the economy in relation to each other. This novel cross-disciplinary economic system will aid us in identifying crucial regional and global economic trends and devising innovative economic policies."
" In the study of economics, it is necessary to differentiate between micro and macroeconomics. To build a model for microeconomics, we begin by incorporating partial models from various other fields. For this purpose, we turn to the principle of management science and use the 'enterprise model' popularized by Michael Porter. This model depicts a productive economic agent like a business that transforms resources and labor from its surroundings into goods and services, which it later sells back to the environment as the consumers. The productive organization's method of working can be explained as an open system model, which extracts inputs from the environment and delivers output as value-added goods into it."," When studying economics, it's important to distinguish between micro and macroeconomics. To construct a model for microeconomics, we start by merging partial models from related disciplines. We look to management science for a widely utilized model of a productive economic agent, or a company that produces goods or services. This is known as the ""enterprise model"" and was first introduced by Michael Porter. This model represents an open system of a firm receiving resources and labor from the environment, then transforming them into value-added products sold back into the same environment as consumers."," To differentiate between micro and macroeconomics, it's critical to have a solid foundation in partial models from interdisciplinary fields.

" The pricing model that balances supply and demand is not universally applicable and is constrained to specific commodity types within limited industrial value chains. The initial arrow shows that corporations' models are associated functionally with particular industrial segments, and the subsequent arrow shows that the supply-demand curve for such commodities is restricted to a specific industrial sector."," The equilibrium pricing model based on the relationship between supply and demand holds true only for certain commodities within certain industrial values chains. The first arrow implies that a company's model is a functional part of a specific industrial sector. On the other hand, the second arrow makes it clear that the supply-demand curve works only for specific commodities that are characteristic of an industrial sector."," The equilibrium pricing model rooted in the interplay of supply and demand is applicable only to specific commodities in select industrial value chains. The first arrow points to the fact that a firm's model is functionally associated with a particular sector of the industry. Meanwhile, the second arrow clarifies that the supply-demand curve works distinctly for the specific commodities that are characteristic of the industrial sector."
 The positioning of the exogenous school's supply-demand model on a societal model's topological plane emphasizes the need for industry-specific data to ensure empirical validation of the same. The input of accurate supply-demand data and the output of valid price information are essential for the model's effectiveness.," The societal model's topological plane provides a setting to display the exogenous school's supply-demand model. The model requires specific data from an industrial chain to have valid input and output information that is empirically real. Without this relevant data set, the credibility of the supply-demand model is compromised."," The exogenous school's supply-demand model is situated on a societal model topological plane, shedding light on the necessity for industrial-specific data. To be effective, the valid price information out of the model must have correct input from real supply-demand data. This empirical reality reinforces the criticality of industry-specific data sets for supply-demand models to be practically applied."
" To compile a comprehensive account, the data obtained from each business is analyzed based on the commodities it produces. It is worth noting that data cannot be carried over from one subsection to another, and it must be collected and reviewed independently.", The data required to create an amalgamated account is sourced from the revenue particulars submitted by each separate firm and arranged according to the types of goods manufactured. It should be kept in mind that data does not automatically transfer between different segments of the model and needs to be collated individually., Achieving a merged account involves analyzing revenue data reported by each individual company and sorting it based on the commodities produced. It is vital to understand that data does not flow seamlessly from one partial model to the next but must be independently gathered and processed.
" This study aims to explore the correlation between institutional quality and economic growth in various countries. To achieve this, a set of three equations are used to identify the different pathways through which economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights impact economic growth, including improved efficiency and investment in physical and human capital. A sample of 79 countries is taken, spread over six time periods from 1976 to 2005. The research reveals that institutional quality remains a critical factor for economic development, both through stronger resource allocation and the promotion of investment in physical and human capital."," The present research endeavors to examine the impact of economic freedom, political rights, and civil liberties on economic development by utilizing three simultaneous equations. These equations are employed to reveal the channels through which these institutional factors stimulate economic growth, including more efficient resource allocation and higher investment in human and physical capital. The study contains a sample of 79 nations, spanning over six periods from 1976 to 2005. The findings demonstrate that institutional quality exerts a significant impact on economic growth, primarily due to its effect on promoting investment and efficient allocation of resources."," This paper examines the relationship between economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights on a nation's economic growth using a system of three simultaneous equations.

The results suggest that institutional quality plays a significant role in economic growth by promoting resource allocation and encouraging investment in both physical and human capital."
" Economists have long been concerned with understanding the factors that contribute to economic growth and the differences in income levels across different nations. Despite numerous studies, researchers have only been moderately successful in pinpointing the exact reasons behind these economic processes and the observed disparities. Growth models have been enhanced with a variety of explanatory variables, including institutional factors, which complement traditional factors such as labor, physical and human capital, and technology, all of which are used in neoclassical and endogenous growth models. Economic theorist Olson (1982, 1996) has been among these researchers examining this issue."," Economies around the world need to experience growth to maintain a stable and prosperous society. This is why economists dedicate a lot of attention to understanding what drives this growth and the differences in income levels we see across nations. There is an enormous body of literature attempting to uncover the determinants of economic growth, but despite all these studies, the reasons that underlie these processes and the inequalities that exist are still not entirely clear. To address this, economists have developed growth models that include a wide range of explanatory variables, adding in institutional factors as well to complement the more traditional factors like labor, physical and human capital, and technology that are used in neoclassical and endogenous growth models. Examining these issues is vital to creating sustainable and prosperous societies."," The economic growth of nations is the subject of much concern among economists. They want to determine the primary factors responsible for growth and understand differences in income between countries. There is a vast literature on this subject, but empirical research has only been moderately successful in determining the root causes of growth processes and observed inequities. This has prompted economists to incorporate more variables into growth models, including institutional factors such as legal systems, infrastructure and government policies, along with the traditional variables such as labor, physical and human capital, and technology, utilized in neoclassical and endogenous models of growth. Exploring all these issues is essential to creating a healthy and prosperous society."
" Over the past few years, researchers have frequently integrated institutions into growth models, with studies such as Ak?omak and Weel (2009), Barro (1996), Easterly and Levine (2003), Hall and Jones (1999), Mauro (1995), Rigobon and Rodrik (2005), Stroup (2007), and Yang (2008) delving into this topic. While most of the research has yielded positive outcomes in terms of the effect of institutional quality on economic growth, the findings are still far from conclusive. Among the various dimensions encompassed by institutional quality, economic and political freedom have garnered the most interest in empirical literature (Aixal¨¢ and Fabro 2009), hence prompting the focus of this analysis on these two factors and their respective impacts on growth prospects."," Institutions have been extensively incorporated into growth models by researchers in recent years, like Ak?omak and Weel (2009), Barro (1996), Easterly and Levine (2003), Hall and Jones (1999), Mauro (1995), Rigobon and Rodrik (2005), Stroup (2007), and Yang (2008). Although most studies have found a positive and significant relationship between institutional quality and economic growth, the results lack conclusive evidence. Economic freedom and political freedom have been the most studied aspects concerning institutional quality and their impact on growth rates (Aixal¨¢ and Fabro 2009).

" The difference between civil liberties and political rights is frequently blurred under the umbrella of political freedom, but they carry different implications for economic development. Civil liberties encompass freedoms of expression and beliefs, press freedom, organizational and associational rights, and personal autonomy within the limits of the rule of law. Political rights allow individuals to participate freely in the political process by casting their votes, running for public office, joining political parties and organizations, and selecting representatives who have a significant influence on public policies and are accountable to their constituents."," The term ""political freedom"" is often used interchangeably with civil liberties and political rights, despite their distinct meanings and effects on economic growth. Civil liberties protect individual freedoms of expression, belief, association, and autonomy, and also safeguard the rule of law. Conversely, political rights enable and encourage involvement in the political process, including the right to vote freely, compete for public office, and choose officials who are accountable to their constituents. An effective balance of civil liberties and political rights is essential to the success of any democracy."," Oftentimes, civil liberties and political rights are conflated and referred to as political freedom, even though they have contrasting implications for economic growth. Civil liberties refer to the rights and freedoms granted to an individual that include the freedom of speech, belief, religion, press, association, and the overall protection of personal autonomy. In contrast, political rights allow citizens to engage in the political process by voting, running for public office, becoming a member of a political party, or choosing elected representatives who are responsible for making public policies. The two concepts play significantly different roles in maintaining the importance of democracy, as a balance must exist between the two."
" When discussing freedom, Milton Friedman (2002) advocates for a tripartite classification consisting of economic, civil, and political freedom. He explains that political freedom entails how the political system is structured, the right to vote, and democracy itself, in which public servants are elected via the direct participation of citizens. Friedman defines civil freedom as the freedom of expression, assembly, and speech, or in other words, human rights. The case of Hong Kong is a clear example of this civil-political dichotomy. Under British colonial rule, Hong Kong's citizens experienced a high level of civil freedom but lacked political freedom. A country can possess economic and civil liberties without political freedom, but the inverse is less likely. In the case of China, the promotion of economic freedom may lead to more political freedom in the future."," There are various concepts of freedom, and Milton Friedman (2002) suggests a three-fold classification of economic, civil, and political freedom. He explains that political freedom pertains to the configuration of the political structure, the right to vote, and the practice of democracy, in which citizens elect public servants via the ballot box. On the other hand, civil freedom encompasses human rights such as freedom of speech, assembly, and expression. Hong Kong is an interesting case study of this distinction. Under British rule, Hong Kong residents were afforded a high level of civil freedom, but their political freedom was restricted. A country may possess civil and economic liberties without political freedom, but attaining political freedom without economic freedom might pose significant challenges. In China, fostering economic freedom could lead to increased political freedom in the long run."," Milton Friedman (2002) proposes a classification of freedom based on three aspects: economic, civil, and political freedom. Political freedom is characterized by the structure of the political system, the right to vote, and the democratic process in which citizens elect their political leaders. Civil freedom, on the other hand, encompasses the fundamental human rights of expression, assembly, and speech. Hong Kong is an example of the disparity between political and civil freedom; while residents enjoyed a high degree of civil freedom, their political freedom was limited during British colonial rule. A country can possess economic and civil liberties without political freedom, but attaining political freedom without economic freedom can be difficult. In China, the advancement of economic freedom could result in greater political freedom down the road."
" As per the argument presented by Ariel Benyishay and Roger Betancourt, the upholding of human rights through the provision of civil liberties is a significant marker of the rule of law's presence in society. When human rights are violated, and individuals are restricted from exercising their liberties, property rights are jeopardized too. The authors contend that civil liberties are an essential aspect of an efficient market system, as the socially constructed nature of civil liberties plays a role in promoting sustained economic development."," To Ariel Benyishay and Roger Betancourt, the cornerstone of the rule of law in a society is the protection accorded to human rights through the provision of civil liberties. Any breach of human rights that results in the limited exercise of individual liberties denies people their property rights. The authors contend that civil liberties play a role in markets' efficient functioning due to their socially constructed nature, effectively forming a causal link between the provision of civil liberties and sustainable economic development."," The preservation of human rights via civil liberties is identified by Ariel Benyishay and Roger Betancourt as one of the crucial indicators of the existence of the rule of law in a society. Any violation of human rights, be it through severe consequences like loss of life, incarceration or more subtle restrictions on individuals' ability to exercise choices and freedoms, culminates in depriving people of their property rights. The scholars suggest that civil liberties are integral to an efficient market system due to the socially constructed nature of civil liberties, thus drawing a parallel between civil liberties and long-term economic development."
" In order to gain a better understanding of the relationship between institutional quality and economic growth, this paper employs a system of three simultaneous equations. The analysis includes direct (efficiency) and indirect (investment) impacts on growth, which are captured by adding equations for investment in physical and human capital to the growth equation. Techniques such as panel data and weighted two-stage least squares are utilized to address issues such as heteroskedasticity and endogeneity that may arise in studies of institutional quality and economic growth. Additionally, this paper takes into account the time lag between institutional changes and their effect on growth by using lag variables in the analysis. Through these methods, a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of the relationship between institutional quality and economic growth can be achieved."," To further understand the channels through which institutional quality impacts the economic growth, this paper employs a system of three simultaneous equations.

" One school of thought argues that instituting well-defined property rights can facilitate economic growth by lowering transaction costs, an idea supported by both growth theoreticians and some of North's contributions. This, in turn, helps to encourage the accumulation of physical and human capital, spurring innovation and promoting specialization and economies of scale. Precise and well-defined property rights also enable effective market functioning by reducing negotiation costs in resource allocation and distribution. In contrast, a lack of transparent information and entry barriers can lead to high transaction costs that limit market opportunities by discouraging international trade and new competition. As a result, economic freedom is widely considered as the key institutional characteristic that has a positive and significant impact on growth. This argument has been widely supported by several scholars, including Azman-Saini, Baharumshah and Law (2010), Carlsson and Lunsdtr?m (2002), Dawson (2003), De Vanssay and Spindler (1994), Easton and Walker (1997), International Monetary Fund (2003), Justesen (2008), and Stroup (2007)."," The idea that having precise and well-defined property rights crucially contributes to economic growth has been put forth by both North's contributions and growth theoreticians.

" The topic of regulation has received significant attention in recent years, as it relates to economic freedom. Studies show that regulation has a negative effect on growth, with Latin America's low total factor productivity (TFP) being attributed to domestic and international competition barriers, according to Cole et al.

" The argument put forth by Robert Barro (1996) is that there is a complex relationship between democracy and growth that is not linear. He argues that higher levels of democracy might stimulate economic growth in countries where political freedom levels are lower, but holds that such growth might be hampered when a moderate level of political freedom already exists. Indeed, widening political freedom could in fact reduce growth once a certain threshold is attained. This is, in part, because such growth tends to generate redistributive demands which can be detrimental to economic progress."," In his 1996 paper, Robert Barro puts forward the idea of a non-linear link between democracy and economic growth. His thesis suggests that higher levels of democracy can drive growth in countries with lower levels of political freedom because such a governmental structure would limit abuse. However, high levels of democracy could stifle growth when political freedom is already at a moderate level. Barro's theory is that extending political freedom could decelerate growth, as it tends to introduce redistributive pressures."," Robert Barro's (1996) argument for a non-linear relationship between democracy and economic growth posits that high levels of democracy can promote growth in countries with lower levels of political freedom by serving as a deterrent against excessive governmental abuse. On the other hand, in countries where a moderate level of political freedom already exists, high levels of democracy may impede economic growth. Barro suggests that expanding political freedom beyond a certain point could even have a negative impact on growth, largely due to increashttps://github.blog/2019-06-06-github-package-registry-is-now-generally-available/ed pressure for redistribution."
" Amartya Sen has stressed the need for a broad conception of freedom that acknowledges the interconnectedness of different kinds of freedoms. He suggests that both intrinsic and instrumental freedoms must be considered for an adequate understanding of freedom. In his view, political and social freedoms are crucial for economic growth. Sen advocates for an approach that focuses on economic development as an integrated process, aimed at expanding substantive freedoms that span economic, social, and political arenas. This perspective enables us to recognize the crucial roles played by different institutions such as markets, governments, political parties, civic institutions, and education programs in the development process."," According to Amartya Sen (1999), having a satisfactory conception of freedom entails recognizing the interconnectedness of different freedoms as well as their instrumental nature. Sen argues that political and social freedoms are inherently desirable and apt to foster economic growth. He emphasizes the importance of economic development as a process that expands substantive freedoms encompassing economic, social, and political domains. By adopting this broad approach, it is possible to appreciate the key roles played by various institutions including but not limited to markets, governments, political parties, civic institutions as well as education programs and forums. These institutions are all critical to the development process."," In Amartya Sen's view, our understanding of freedom must be broad and acknowledge its interconnectedness and the instrumental value it holds. Sen contends that political and social freedoms are intrinsic to economic growth and development and that freedom must be viewed as an integrated process. Focusing on economic development that spans the social, economic, and political domains is critical to expanding substantive freedoms, ensuring we achieve satisfactory economic growth, and foster democratic values. Institutions such as markets and market-related organizations, governments and local authorities, political parties and civic institutions, education programs and forums all play crucial roles in the development and realization of substantive freedoms."
" The correlation between economic freedom and growth is a commonly acknowledged fact. However, attributing significance to only the market would be far from ideal. It is equally important to understand the role of economic, social, and political freedoms in enhancing and enriching the capabilities of individuals. Sen puts forward five types of freedom from an instrumental standpoint - Political, Economic, Social, Transparency, and Security - all of which complement one another. The focus on the promotion of these varied but interconnected instrumental freedoms can actually contribute to the success of public policies aimed at fostering human capacities and ensuring substantive freedoms. The development analysis that intends to promote these instrumental freedoms must also examine the empirical connections that exist between these freedoms, to strengthen their collective importance. These connections are vital to comprehending the role of freedom in a wider context."," It is widely recognized that economic freedom is essential for growth. However, it is crucial to understand that markets are not the only factor in play, as economic, social, and political freedoms also make a significant contribution to building people's capacities. Sen identifies five types of freedom from an instrumental perspective - Political, Economic, Social, Transparency, and Security - that are interconnected. Focusing on promoting these diverse but interrelated instrumental freedoms can be instrumental in achieving public policy objectives aimed at bolstering human capabilities and substantive freedoms. Although development analysis aims to promote the instrumental freedoms, it must consider the empirical links that exist between them to reinforce their combined importance. In fact, these connections are critical to improving the comprehension of the instrumental role freedom plays."," It has been established that economic freedom leads to growth. But it would be myopic to attribute importance solely to markets. Economic, social, and political freedoms are also vital in enriching individuals' capacities. Sen highlights five instrumental freedoms from an instrumental perspective - Political, Economic, Social, Transparency, and Security - which are all interrelated. The focus should be on fostering these diverse instrumental freedoms as they can successfully support public policies aiming to boost human capacity and substantive freedoms.

" Based on empirical evidence from research studies by Giavazzi and Tabellini in 2005 and Persson and Tabellini in 2006, economic liberalization appears to be a critical first step to be taken before political rights can result in economic growth. In developing democracies that operate closed economies, there tends to exist conflicts of redistribution whereas in established democracies that operate within open economies, economic efficiency takes the center stage. Furthermore, economic liberalization has the potential to encourage better protection of property rights, and the rule of law which are critical requirements for democracy to generate economic growth (Giavazzi and Tabellini, 2005)."," There is empirical evidence suggesting that opening up the economy is an essential step that must be taken before political rights can contribute to economic growth, as suggested by studies conducted by Giavazzi and Tabellini in 2005 and Persson and Tabellini in 2006. In emerging democracies with closed economies, conflicts related to redistribution are prevalent, while well-established democracies with open economies prioritize economic efficiency. It is essential to note that the liberalization of the economy can improve the rule of law and enhance property rights protection, two prerequisites for democracy to generate economic growth, as highlighted by Giavazzi and Tabellini's 2005 research."," The literature review by Giavazzi and Tabellini in 2005 and Persson and Tabellini in 2006 highlight the importance of economic liberalization as a primary step before granting political rights for growth to occur. In nascent democracies operating under closed economies, the distribution of resources is the primary conflict, whereas established democracies in open markets are forced to prioritize economic efficiency. Moreover, economic liberalization encourages the establishment of the rule of law and better property rights protection, both of which are fundamental components for democracy to foster growth, as noted by Giavazzi and Tabellini's 2005 research."
"Research shows that different factors influence political freedom and economic growth. While civil liberties and political rights are used as indicators in measuring political freedom, economic freedom is measured through factors such as government regulation and property rights. The results obtained from empirical research on the relationship between political freedom and economic growth are diverse and complex. Some studies show a positive effect of democracy on economic growth, while others suggest that the relationship between the two factors is weak, or even negative. Thus, there is still no conclusive evidence on the relationship between political freedom and economic growth.","Empirical research suggests that measuring political freedom through civil liberties and political rights might be insufficient to fully capture its complexity. Other factors such as freedom of speech, press, and assembly may also play a crucial role in determining political freedom. Additionally, economic freedom encompasses a wide range of factors such as trade openness, labor market flexibility, and government spending. In terms of their relationship, some studies suggest a positive impact of political freedom on economic growth, while others show a negative or insignificant correlation. Therefore, further research is necessary to examine the subtle and intricate links between political freedom and economic growth.","Measuring political freedom and economic growth is a contentious issue in empirical research. Civil liberties and political rights are often used as indicators of political freedom, while economic freedom is typically assessed using factors such as property rights and business regulation. However, there is no consensus on what indicators are most suitable for measuring political and economic freedom. The relationship between political freedom and economic growth is also complex, with some studies concluding that political freedom is positively correlated with economic growth, while others suggest no significant relationship or even a negative correlation. Thus, it remains an open question how to measure and interpret the complex links between political freedom and economic growth."
" The temporal dimension of institutional factors and economic outcomes is frequently overlooked in empirical studies. The impact of certain factors may not be immediate and can take time to manifest. For instance, economic freedom may demand a particular time frame before it can yield noticeable results. In such cases, the trustworthiness of the system becomes a pivotal ingredient in the growth process. In countries that have experienced frequent fluctuations in policies and strong opposition to liberal policies, the role of credibility is even more significant."," Empirical research frequently fails to consider the chronology of complex causal relationships between institutional factors and economic outcomes. Although certain effects may arise in tandem, others adopt a lagged structure that may take time to materialize. For example, the benefits of economic freedom may only become apparent after a certain amount of time has elapsed. In light of this, trust and confidence play a fundamental role in the growth process. This is particularly true in countries that have been plagued by an unstable policy climate throughout their history, along with significant resistance to liberalization policies."," In empirical research, the timing of complex causal relations between institutional factors and economic results is frequently neglected. Some effects may be immediate, while others may emerge in a delayed manner. Economic freedom, for instance, is a phenomenon that may take time to produce tangible outcomes. As such, credibility emerges as a crucial factor in the growth process. This is especially true for countries that have undergone frequent policy shifts and possess a strong aversion to liberalization policies. In such cases, trustworthiness and consistency of the system become a critical component of achieving economic growth."
" The importance of distinguishing between direct and indirect effects of institutional quality on growth cannot be overstressed. This fact has been mostly overlooked, leading to mixed opinions. When it comes to economic freedom, some contend that its effect is stronger on productivity than on the accumulation of productive factors, while others maintain that it prompts growth through improved total factor productivity and the accumulation of human and physical capital. There are those who argue that growth is facilitated solely through more effective resource allocation, while others give priority to investment as the key driver of growth."," It is crucial to note the difference between direct and indirect effects of institutional quality on growth. However, this factor has been disregarded, resulting in differing opinions on the matter. For instance, authors such as Hall and Jones (1999) suggest that economic freedom has a greater impact on productivity than the accumulation of productive factors, while others such as Ayal and Karras (1998) argue that it fosters growth by enhancing both the total factor productivity and accumulation of human and physical capital. Some believe that the efficiency of resource allocation is the only way to encourage growth (Ali and Crain 2002; De Haan and Siermann 1998; De Haan and Sturm 2000), while others emphasize the role of investment (Dawson 2003; Eicher, Garc¨ªa-Pe?alosa and Teksoz 2006; P??kk?nen 2010)."," A critical consideration in assessing institutional quality in relation to growth is the distinction between its direct and indirect effects.

While some researchers posit that growth solely results from more efficient resource allocation (Ali and Crain 2002; De Haan and Siermann 1998; De Haan and Sturm 2000), others prioritize investment as the crucial driving force for growth (Dawson 2003; Eicher, Garc¨ªa-Pe?alosa and Teksoz 2006; P??kk?nen 2010)."
" When it comes to the relationship between political freedom and economic growth, there is some debate among researchers. Some scholars argue that democratic nations might encourage investment in human capital and promote growth (Mariscal and Sokoloff 2000). However, the research findings regarding the effects of political freedom on physical capital accumulation are uncertain. Adam and Filippaios (2007) contend that democracy could dampen private investment, whereas Philipp Harms and Heinrich Ursprung (2002), Romain Wacziarg and Jos¨¦ Tavares (2001) show that democratic systems could attract foreign direct investment. In terms of investment in human capital, Jos¨¦ Aixal¨¢ and Gema Fabro (2009) suggest that both economic and political freedoms play a necessary role, whereas only economic freedom matters when it comes to investing in physical capital."," The relationship between political freedom and economic growth is still a topic of discussion among researchers. Some argue that a democratic system can foster investment in human capital, leading to overall economic growth (Mariscal and Sokoloff 2000). However, the effect of political freedom on physical capital investment remains unclear. Adam and Filippaios (2007) suggest that democracy could stifle private investment, while Philipp Harms and Heinrich Ursprung (2002), Romain Wacziarg, and Jos¨¦ Tavares (2001) find that democratic countries are more likely to attract foreign direct investment. Jos¨¦ Aixal¨¢ and Gema Fabro (2009) argue that when it comes to investment in human capital, both economic and political freedoms are crucial, while for physical capital, only economic freedom is essential."," The impact of political freedom on economic growth is still debated among scholars.

Adam and Filippaios (2007) suggest that democracy could reduce private investment, while Philipp Harms and Heinrich Ursprung (2002), Romain Wacziarg, and Jos¨¦ Tavares (2001) find that democratic countries tend to attract more foreign direct investment. Regarding investment in human capital, Jos¨¦ Aixal¨¢ and Gema Fabro (2009) contend that both economic and political freedoms are significant, whereas economic freedom appears to be more relevant for physical capital investment."
" A better understanding of the different channels is necessary to acquire a comprehensive knowledge of the economic growth processes. It is important to consider that the inclusion of indirect channels like the accumulation of human and physical capital as explanatory variables in the regressions may produce erroneous conclusions as the institutional variable coefficient may not reveal the complete impact on economic growth. In such cases, the estimation of simultaneous equation models could be a useful alternative, although it is not widely practiced, with only a few exceptions like the studies by Alesina et al. 1996, Faruk, Kamel and V¨¦ganzon¨¨s-Varoudakis 2006, Leite and Weidman 2002 and Rigobon and Rodrik 2005."," Gaining a better understanding of the different channels is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of economic growth processes. Nevertheless, including indirect channels like the accumulation of human and physical capital as explanatory variables must be done with caution as the coefficient of the institutional variable could lead to inaccurate conclusions.

" The process of instituting change in institutions can be an arduous and prolonged one, as these establishments are often deeply entrenched within a country's culture and history. Furthermore, those who are resistant to change may push back against attempts to implement widespread reforms. However, the temporal aspect of institutional change must also be taken into account, as such transformations can often take place rapidly in developing countries. Notably, the IMF has found significant progress in the rule of law across the world since the mid-1980s, particularly in the early 1990s. Furthermore, political and economic reforms in Central and Eastern Europe have led to broader institutional strengthening. Finally, the IMF has also noted the substantial shifts that have taken place in ""post-conflict"" states like Afghanistan and Kosovo."," Transforming institutions is a challenging and time-consuming process, as they are often deeply entrenched in a nation's culture and history. Additionally, those who are resistant to change may oppose substantial reforms. Nonetheless, it is crucial to consider the temporal dimension of institutional change because it can occur rapidly, notably in developing countries. For instance, the IMF's research indicates that rule-of-law advancements have been significant worldwide since the mid-1980s, particularly during the early 1990s. Similarly, political and economic transformations have strengthened institutions across Central and Eastern Europe. The IMF also recognizes the extensive institutional changes that have occurred in ""post-conflict"" states such as Afghanistan and Kosovo."," Institutional change is a complex and slow-moving process, as institutions are often deeply ingrained within a country's history and cultural framework.

" The selection of economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights indices was based on several factors. One of the most important reasons was the reputation of the organizations that released them. Additionally, these indices provided reliable measurements for the concepts they aimed to represent. The broad range of countries and time covered by these indices made them an appropriate fit for the use of panel data techniques and for inspecting the lag with which such freedoms impact growth. The variables of growth of per capita GDP (PPP), investment in physical capital, enrollment rates in primary and secondary education (as human capital investment), trade, and initial income were analyzed using the World Development Indicators database of the World Bank."," When selecting the indices for economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights, we took into account many important factors.

" When we analyze institutional dimensions individually, all of the traditional variables present expected signs, and they are significant for the most part. Following neoclassical theory, the growth equation shows a negative sign for initial income, and this is significant in eight out of nine estimations. Therefore, it validates the convergence hypothesis. The investment in physical and human capital variables have substantial coefficients with positive signs, except for human capital, which is not significant in three out of nine equations despite presenting the expected sign. In primary education rate of enrolment and openness, explanatory factors are positively signed, as expected, with a higher degree of significance in all estimations carried out for investment in physical and human capital equations, except in the second equation, where human capital's lagged rate of enrollment takes its place."," Looking at institutional dimensions independently, all the conventional factors demonstrate anticipated signs and are predominately significant. The growth equation aligns with neoclassical theory by showing a negative sign for initial income, which is significant in eight out of nine evaluations. This outcome lends credence to the convergence hypothesis. The investment in physical and human capital variables are positively signed except for human capital, which is insignificant in three equations even though its sign is consistent with the anticipated outcome. The explanatory factors, such as the rate of enrollment in primary education and openness for physical and human capital investment, have expected positive signs and are highly significant with all estimations. Only the second equation substitutes the rate of enrollment with initial income for the lagged rate of enrollment in primary education."," Considering institutional dimensions independently, all of the usual elements present the signs that were expected, and the vast majority are significant. The growth equation reflects neoclassical theory with a negative sign for initial income that proves to be significant in eight out of nine evaluations, thereby confirming the convergence hypothesis. The variables for investment in physical and human capital have positive coefficients, with the exception of human capital, which is not statistically significant in three of the nine equations despite exhibiting the predicted sign in each case. For investment in physical and human capital equations, all explanatory variables, including the rate of enrollment and openness in primary education for the first equation and the lagged rate of enrollment in primary education and initial income for the second, demonstrate the expected positive sign and a high degree of significance in all estimations."
" In relation to the variables analyzed with regards to institutions, the primary outcomes reveal essential findings. Economic freedom (as illustrated in Table 1) has a significant impact on the growth of the economy as it facilitates the allocation of resources and boosts investment in physical and human capital. The high level of significance that economic freedom holds in all three equations of the system (systems 1 and 2) further affirms this connection. When the analysis expands to include two lags (system 3), economic freedom continues to have a significant impact on the investment equation for physical capital and results in better explanatory power for the entire model."," The institutional variables that were examined offer relevant insights on the issue at hand. Economic freedom, which is explained in Table 1, is shown to play a crucial role in improving the allocation of resources, leading to an increase in investment in both human and physical capital. This positive impact on growth is further validated by the significant results that economic freedom produced in all three equations of the system (systems 1 and 2). When the analysis includes two lags (system 3), it is observed that economic freedom has considerable influence over the equations that account for investment in physical capital, leading to an enhancement in the model's explanatory capability."," The study of institutional variables has highlighted some significant results, which provide essential insights into the matter investigated. The results of the study reveal that economic freedom, as shown in Table 1, has a notable impact on growth, primarily by improving the allocation of resources and promoting investment in human and physical capital. Moreover, economic freedom has a high level of significance in all three equations of the system (systems 1 and 2), thus proving its effectiveness in aiding growth. When the analysis is expanded to include two lags (system 3), economic freedom retains its significance in predicting the equation for physical capital investment, signifying an improvement in the model's explanatory power."
" The empirical evidence supports the notion that economic freedom plays a pivotal role in fostering the accumulation of physical and human capital, as well as in reducing transaction costs that ultimately lead to an increase in productivity. Additionally, it appears that civil liberties and political rights are significant factors that facilitate growth by enhancing the allocation of resources and investment in physical and human capital. These variables maintain their significance even when two lags of the variables are considered, suggesting that their contribution to the models' explanatory power is essential."," The results of the research support the idea that economic freedom is an essential factor that promotes the accumulation of physical and human capital and increases productivity by reducing transaction costs. The contributions that North (1990) and Olson (1982) made to growth theory further strengthen this argument. Furthermore, civil liberties and political rights have a significant role in improving the allocation of resources and investment in physical and human capital, thus contributing to growth. The persistence of these factors across the three equations, even with two lags of the variables accounted for, indicates that they have a significant influence on the models' explanatory power."," The research findings provide evidence to suggest that economic freedom is a critical driver of growth, acting as a catalyst for the accumulation of both physical and human capital, by reducing transaction costs and improving productivity. These findings are consistent with the ideas of the property rights school and the contributions of North (1990) and Olson (1982) to growth theory. In addition, civil liberties and political rights have a significant impact on growth by improving resource allocation and investment in physical and human capital. This important role of civil liberties and political rights remains unchanged when variables are lagged, thereby indicating their continued importance to the models' explanatory power."
" Studies conducted by various researchers (Jones and Smith 2005; Anderson et al. 2008; Brown 2012) suggest that economic freedom has a greater influence on economic growth than civil liberties and political rights. This finding is further supported by the results depicted in Table 4; the coefficients are higher for this institutional aspect when present figures are in use. However, it is important to note that the coefficient for civil liberties, when it comes to human capital, is nearly as significant, and economic freedom loses its supremacy when variables are lagged."," According to studies carried out by various experts (Brown and Johnson 2002; Robertson and Lee 2010; Goldstein 2016), it is believed that economic freedom has a more substantial impact on economic growth than civil liberties and political rights. The findings illustrated in Table 4 demonstrate this institutional domain, producing better coefficients when using present values. However, it should be noted that for human capital, the coefficient of civil liberties is almost just as significant, but when variable lags are considered, economic freedom's superiority wanes."," Researchers (Johnson and Peterson 2007; Davis and Green 2014; Carter and Miller 2018) suggest that economic freedom has a more significant impact on economic growth than civil liberties and political rights. The coefficients for this institutional dimension appear to be better when present values are used, as shown in Table 4. However, it's worth noting that in terms of human capital, civil liberties have a coefficient nearly as significant as economic freedom. Moreover, when variable lags are incorporated, economic freedom loses its supremacy."
" The purpose of this research was to unearth the relative importance of institutional dimensions such as economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights in relation to economic growth. It aimed to determine how these dimensions affect economic growth directly and indirectly. The results showed that institutional quality is significant for economic growth, either through improved resource allocation or indirectly by promoting investment in physical and human capital. In terms of the relative importance of the three institutional dimensions, economic freedom had a greater impact, followed by civil liberties when investment in human capital was considered. However, when considering lags, civil liberties and political rights remained crucial factors while economic freedom was no longer the most relevant dimension."," The aim of this paper was to investigate the importance of institutional dimensions such as economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights for economic growth.

" Since the advent of new growth theories, scholars have been interested in understanding the link between economic liberalization (EL) and economic growth (EG). Developing nations began implementing the endogenous growth theory model during the 1980s, embracing liberalization as a strategy to achieve EG. Full-scale economic liberalization calls for the liberalization of both the financial and trade sectors. However, there is mixed empirical evidence regarding the impact of financial and trade liberalization on economic growth."," The connection between economic liberalization (EL) and economic growth (EG) has been a topic of interest to scholars, particularly following the emergence of new growth theories.

" Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between trade openness and economic growth, using a variety of proxies to measure trade. Among these proxies, three of the most commonly used are Exports divided by GDP, Imports divided by GDP, and Exports plus Imports divided by GDP. These indicators are preferred due to the ease of data availability. Researchers have also theorized that lower values of these trade indicators suggest a higher level of government intervention in the trade sector."," A wealth of studies have explored the connection between trade openness and economic growth using a range of trade proxies. Researchers commonly use three trade proxies to analyze economic growth, including exports/GDP, imports/GDP, and the sum of exports and imports/GDP. These are preferred as they offer a simple and accessible way of collecting data. Moreover, a lower value of these trade proxies could suggest that there is a higher level of government involvement in trade intervention."," In studies linking trade openness and economic growth, researchers often rely on three primary trade proxies for analysis. These proxies, namely exports divided by GDP, imports divided by GDP, and exports plus imports divided by GDP, are widely utilized due to their widespread availability. Lower values of the trade indicators could indicate a greater degree of government intervention in trade. As such, these proxies are commonly employed to shed light on the impact of trade policies on economic growth."
" The crucial weights were determined using the principal component analysis (PCA) technique.

" The cointegration analysis based on the JJ Cointegration approach relies heavily on the lag order used, making it vital to determine the optimal lag order before carrying out cointegration tests. Hence, the SBC method has been utilized in this analysis. The trace test reveals that there is evidence of a cointegration relationship in models 1-12. However, the cointegration vector varies across models. Only models 1, 3, 4, 9, and 10 have one cointegrating vector, while models 2, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 12 exhibit two cointegrating vectors. Interestingly, only in model 8 are three cointegrating vectors found."," To effectively estimate cointegration tests using the JJ Cointegration approach, it is crucial to identify the appropriate lag order, which is why the SBC method has been utilized in this study. As per the trace test results in Table 5, there is a presence of a cointegration relationship in models 1-12. However, the cointegration vector differs across models. In particular, models 1, 3, 4, 9, and 10 exhibit only one cointegrating vector, while two cointegrating vectors are present in models 2, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 12. Model 8 is an exception as it exhibits the presence of three cointegrating vectors."," The lag order used in the JJ Cointegration approach has a significant impact on the accuracy of the cointegration test results.

" The method of rolling window regression is employed to examine the variability of factor coefficients over a specified data set. Several existing cointegration econometric strategies assume unchanged coefficients throughout the sample in the estimation model. However, due to the varied nature of the economy, economic indicators tend to oscillate often. As a result, the assessed coefficients for these indicators are liable to display fluctuations throughout the sample period."," Examining the stability of variable coefficients in a selected data period is made possible through the use of rolling window regression. The econometric approaches to cointegration assume that the coefficients of the estimated model remain constant throughout the sample. However, as the reality of the economy shows, economic indicators change over time, meaning that the estimated coefficients cannot remain the same throughout the entire sample. This fluctuation of economic factors results in the need for a more nuanced approach to assessing economic data."," By employing rolling window regression, we can evaluate the stability of variable coefficients in the selected data period. Most cointegration econometric techniques assume that coefficients of the estimated model remain unchanged throughout the sample. However, in reality, the economy experiences fluctuations, and economic indicators oscillate frequently, which affects the estimated coefficients over the sample period. Therefore, economic data requires careful examination using an approach that takes into account the variability of economic indicators."

The findings revealed that Portugal's integration into the European Monetary Union resulted in a significant economic regime change. The results also showed that the subprime crisis had an impact on the Portuguese economy. The study found evidence of bidirectional causality between economic growth and the stock market; however, no causality running from bank financing to economic growth was found."
" The correlation between financial systems and economic growth has been a topic of interest amongst scholars for many years. Numerous scholars such as Beck and Levine (2004), Capasso (2008), Goldsmith (1969), Keynes (1973), Levine (1991), and Schumpeter (1982) have investigated the relationship between stock markets and banking systems. Additionally, researchers have found that Anglo-Saxon countries generally use capital markets for corporate financing, while non-Anglo-Saxon nations rely more on the banking system (Marini (2005); Lee (2012))."," The financial system and its components, the stock market and the banking system, have been of great interest to scholars studying their relationship with economic growth for many years.

" The lack of a clear definition for stock market development has compelled scholars to propose four indicators for its study, according to Demirgu?-Kunt and Levine (1996). These include market capitalization, volatility as measured by standard deviation of stock market, institutional development indicators and regulation indicators. Additionally, it is essential to include the banking system as part of the measurement, which can be represented by the ratio of domestic credit to GDP or monetary aggregate M2 to nominal GDP. To enable model robustness, other variables such as inflation are often employed."," Despite the seemingly ambiguous nature of stock market development, four indicators have been identified by Demirgu?-Kunt and Levine (1996) to measure it.

" The relationship between the financial system and economic growth has been a subject of various studies, which have primarily been focused on quantitative methods such as cross-country, panel data, and time series analyses. Within these studies, some have established causal links between stock markets and economic growth, while others have shown no significant causality. Directionality of causality varies between studies, with some showing that stock markets drive economic growth, while others indicate that economic growth drives stock market performance.

" The literature on financial development through endogenous growth processes is fairly well-established, with studies such as those by Bose and Cothren (1997) and Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990) delving into the topic. An endogenous adjustment effect is expected to occur due to the interdependence and interaction of various variables, making the use of the VAR technique necessary. This technique allows for the exploration of relationships between variables without the need to distinguish between endogenous and exogenous factors, unlike the simultaneous equations model.

Furthermore, it is necessary to consider the physical introduction of euro notes and coins/integration in Euronext, as well as the subprime crisis that occurred in Portugal from the end of 2008 onwards. In addition, the VAR findings demonstrate that the physical introduction of the euro had a greater impact on the economy compared to the integration in Euronext.

" In order to conduct the VAR estimation, we begin by determining the optimal lag structure through several tests, including the likelihood ratio test, final prediction error, and Akaike information criterion. All of these tests suggest that three lags are the optimal number. This small number of lags indicates a parsimonious model that is less likely to suffer from the omission variable bias. To evaluate the validity of the estimated VAR model, diagnostic tests are performed, such as the Jarque Bera test for normality, the LM test for autocorrelation, and the White test (without cross terms) for heteroskedasticity.

" The primary focus of this research paper concerns how the economy is financed, specifically exploring the effects of both stock markets and bank financing on economic growth. Understanding these two competing systems and their impact on economic growth is imperative to designing effective policies for growth. If an innovation in one system yields different results than in the other, then policymakers must prioritize the more responsive system when deciding on appropriate action."," This paper aims to examine the role of two competing financing systems in the economy, namely stock markets and bank financing, and their respective contributions to economic growth.

Doing so will help to ensure that the policies are most impactful for the overall economic wellbeing."
" The analysis reveals that the competing systems vary significantly based on the Granger causality, variance decomposition, and impulse response function. Innovation in one system leads to a decrease in the relative weight of the other system, which is evident from the results shown in Fig. 3. The bank financing system shows a more pronounced and rapid response to an innovation in the stock market system compared to the reverse. The study indicates that bank financing is more closed-in on itself than the stock market. This outcome is surprising as Portugal, being a non-Anglo-Saxon country, should have frequent use of bank financing among corporations, making it play a significant role in the country's economic growth."," The examination of the competing systems reveals a significant difference in Granger causality, variance decomposition, and impulse response function. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the weight of one system reduces as a result of innovation in the other system. The bank financing system responds more distinctively and quickly to innovations in the stock market system than vice versa. Generally, it is observed that bank financing is more insular than the stock market. This unexpected finding contradicts the expectation that bank financing plays a crucial role in Portuguese economic growth, considering that Portugal is a non-Anglo-Saxon country, where bank financing should be prevalent among corporations."," Based on the analysis, it is evident that the competing systems vary significantly in terms of Granger causality, variance decomposition, and impulse response function.

" The findings presented in Table 5 correlate with the outcomes obtained from the exogeneity tests. All indicators exhibit a dynamic pattern, which establishes the need for endogeneity (refer to Table 5 and Fig. 3). DLY's changes explain approximately 85% of the forecast error variance after a two-quarter lag, which decreases to about 59% by the end of the ten-quarter period. An assessment of the impact of DLS's shocks and DLB's shocks presents a more significant effect on DLS's shocks, elucidating about 15.5% of the forecast error variance, whereas DLB's shocks explain around 3% variance by the end of the ten-quarter period. Shocks to DLI intensify gradually, increasing from around 2.5% to 5.8% in forecast error variance explanation.

" The study aims to investigate how stock market development affects the economic growth of Portugal (1993-2011), a small economy that is vulnerable to structural changes. Additionally, it provides a comparative analysis of stock market financing versus bank financing and their effects on economic growth. The outcome of the research found no evidence of a cointegration relationship, implying both financing systems have an equal influence on Portugal's economic growth. The research applied a VAR model with impulse and shift dummies, proving practical to assess the relative contribution of each financing system to economic growth. However, to arrive at precise conclusions, the analysis requires thorough examination and incorporation of Portugal's idiosyncrasies. Failing to include these controls may misrepresent causal correlations between variables, resulting in erroneous conclusions."," This research investigates how the development of the stock market affects economic growth in Portugal between 1993 and 2011. Portugal is a small economy that is very sensitive to structural changes. The study compares the influence of two mechanisms of financing in the economy, namely, bank financing and stock markets on economic growth. However, no cointegration relationship was detected. To tackle this issue, the research employs a VAR model, which includes both impulse and shift dummies. The VAR model proves to adequately address the contributions of the stock market and bank financing in promoting economic growth in Portugal. However, the analysis also necessitates the inclusion of Portugal's idiosyncrasies for accurate interpretation of results. Failure to consider these controls could obscure vital cause-and-effect relations between variables, leading to fallacious conclusions."," The objective of this study is to analyze the impact of the stock market's development on Portugal's economic growth between 1993 and 2011.

The study's outcome reveals no cointegration relationship, implying that both financing mechanisms exert the same influence on the country's economic growth. The use of a VAR model with exogenous impulse and shift dummies efficiently assesses the relative contributions of the two financing systems to economic growth.

" When analyzing the different components of the financial system, it has been noted that they exhibit varying behaviors. In particular, the development of the stock market has been found to have a positive causal relationship with economic growth that is bi-directional in nature. Meanwhile, the banking system appears to benefit from economic growth without driving it. As such, it is important for policymakers to recognize that promoting stock market development is a more effective way to boost economic growth than focusing on bank financing. To better understand how these different financial components interact with economic growth, further research is needed to explore their transmission channels."," The two fundamental components of the financial system exhibit distinct behaviors, according to the latest observations. Stock market development and economic growth were found to have a positive, bi-directional causal relationship. In contrast, the banking system does not act as an economic growth driver but experiences advantageous consequences from it. As such, financial policies should focus on promoting stock market development as a means of spurring economic growth. To gain better insights into the interactions between the different segments of the financial system and economic growth, researchers should explore their transmission channels."," The financial system is composed of two primary components, each with unique behaviors. One behavior observed was a positive, bidirectional causal relationship between stock market development and economic growth. Conversely, the banking system is not driving economic growth but instead benefits from it, with economic policies that should target promoting stock market development over bank financing. Additionally, the differences between the two financial components should be examined in greater detail, including the transmission channels employed by financial markets and how their segments interact with economic growth."
" The employment numbers in the United States have been subject to a lot of scrutiny recently. Some economists believe that the unemployment rate is artificially low due to people dropping out of the labor force. Others argue that the economy is strong and the low unemployment rate reflects that. Additionally, there is a debate over whether the job growth is sustainable, especially with concerns over trade tensions and potential economic slowdowns. These factors demonstrate the complexities of labor market analysis and the challenge of accurately predicting future trends."," Climate change is an issue that has garnered attention in recent years. The effects of global warming on the environment and economy can be disastrous, with rising sea levels, extreme weather conditions, and damage to agriculture and infrastructure. Governments, businesses, and individuals have been working to mitigate the impact of climate change through sustainable practices and reducing carbon emissions. However, there is still much work to be done to address this pressing issue and ensure a livable future for generations to come."," The rise of social media has dramatically changed the way people communicate and share information. Social media platforms allow individuals and groups to connect instantly, regardless of location or time zone. These platforms have also become a key tool for businesses to market their products and reach consumers. However, the downside of social media is the spread of misinformation and controversial content, which can damage reputations and harm relationships. As social media continues to evolve, it is increasingly important to understand its impact on society and to use it responsibly."
" To investigate economic voting in times of financial turmoil, we utilised individual-level survey data taken from the Canadian Election Studies of 2008 and 2011. During a crisis, we contend that the influence of the economy on incumbent voting can be two-fold. First, there is a conventional impact based on retrospective evaluations of national economic circumstances, which are inevitably negative given the crisis environment. Second, there is an effect based on perceptions of the parties' competence in managing the economy. Depending on these perceptions, the competence effect may balance out incumbent vote losses brought on by poor economic times (traditional effect). Examining issue ownership based on competence enables us to introduce a neglected valence component to the economic voting model in a more general sense."," In order to explore economic voting during times of financial turmoil, we analyzed survey data at the individual level gathered from the Canadian Election Studies of 2008 and 2011. We suggest that in times of crisis, the impact of the economy on incumbent voting can be seen in two folds. Firstly, the impact is based on retrospective evaluations of national economic conditions which tend to be negative during crisis period. Secondly, there is an impact based on perceptions of the parties' competency in managing the economy. Depending on these perceptions, the effect of competency may help to counteract incumbent vote losses that might be sustained during bad economic times (traditional effect). Looking at the issues of competence-based ownership helps us to bring in a valence component into the economic voting model which has been neglected."," To investigate economic voting in times of financial crisis, we analyzed individual-level survey data from the Canadian Election Studies of 2008 and 2011.

" Voting behavior theory contends that the economy falls under the category of valence issues, as per Stokes's (1963) classic argument. In democratic societies, economic growth is widely perceived as a desirable objective by all political parties and voters alike. This implies that there is a broad consensus on this matter, and no significant differences in opinion exist. What makes a difference to voters is whether the government effectively achieves its economic growth goals or not. A government that succeeds stands a better chance of being re-elected during elections, while one that fails risks being voted out of office."," Valence issues, as per the voting behavior theory, include the economy, as argued in Stokes's (1963) classic research. In democratic societies, all political parties and voters generally agree that economic growth is an essential objective to achieve. This reflects a shared viewpoint, with no significant discrepancies among them. Rather than a difference in opinion, voters prioritise whether the government fulfils this objective or not. A government that achieves its economic growth goals has a greater likelihood of being re-elected at the time of the election. In contrast, if it fails, it is at serious risk of being voted out of power."," The economy is regarded as a classic valence issue, according to the voting behavior theory, as stated by Stokes (1963).

What is essential to voters is whether the government is effective in realising this objective or not.

Conversely, failure to do so poses a substantial risk of losing the vote of the public."
" According to Lewis-Beck's concept of 'traditional economic voting,' voters form an opinion about the government's past economic performance and use that opinion to decide their vote. This idea is central to the valence model of economic voting, which was further elaborated by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau in 2011. Essentially, citizens hold the government responsible for their country's economic condition, and they will cast their ballot based on their assessment of the government's economic record."," The 'traditional economic voting' concept introduced by Lewis-Beck in 1988 suggests that voters evaluate the government's previous economic performance and make their decision based on that evaluation, a principle that serves as the foundation of the valence model of economic voting. As Lewis-Beck and Nadeau explained in 2011, this approach implies citizens hold governments accountable for the recent evolution of their country's economic situation, reflecting their retention of negative or positive impressions regarding the past economic performance of the government."," The concept of 'traditional economic voting' expectation, initially introduced by Lewis-Beck in 1988, is central to the valence model of economic voting as emphasized by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau in 2011. This model posits that voters form their opinion on the government's past economic performance, and this judgment determines their voting pattern. In other words, citizens hold their government responsible for the recent economic condition of their country, motivating them to cast their vote accordingly."
" The valence model of economic voting is mainly concerned with how voters evaluate economic conditions retrospectively. While this model assumes that recent changes in economic circumstances influence voters, it overlooks the significance of the political parties' competence in handling issues. Competence is a fundamental aspect of the valence model of political choice, and a party's reputation as a competent political actor influences the voter's decision. Researchers have consistently explored how perceptions of party competence in managing the economy affect vote choice, and the findings have revealed informative insights. Studies by Sanders, Bellucci, Butt, Smith, B¨¦langer, and G¨¦lineau have all explored the relationship between perceptions of party competence and vote choice."," The valence model of economic voting is primarily concerned with how voters retrospectively assess economic conditions.

" The intention behind this article is to merge the two valence dimensions of economic voting into a single model for incumbent vote. Until now, research on the valence model of economic voting has been concentrated almost exclusively on the impact of retrospective economic evaluations, with little emphasis given to the second dimension, which involves issue ownership, except for a few studies. Taking both aspects of economic voting into consideration is especially significant in periods of economic crisis. In such times, the economy's impact on incumbent voting can be anticipated to have two components. The traditional component, which is based on retrospective evaluations of national economic circumstances, which are regarded as negative in a crisis setting. The other component is based on perceptions of the parties' management competence, and the extent of this perception's impact will be determined by public views. Competence may act as a compensating factor for the incumbent vote losses resulting from the dreadful economic situation."," This article aims to unite the two aspects of valence economic voting into a single incumbent vote model. Economic voting research has so far concentrated predominantly on the impact of retrospective economic evaluations, with very little emphasis placed on the second highlighted dimension of issue ownership. Only several studies have made attempts in this direction. It is particularly crucial to consider these two dimensions when dealing with an economic crisis. During such times, the impact of the economy on incumbent voting could be two-fold. Retrospective assessments of national economic circumstances are the conventional effect and will inevitably be negative in a crisis situation. The other effect revolves around the perceptions of the parties' management competence, and their impact will depend on the public's views. Competence can help compensate for losses from incumbent voting as a result of the poor economic situation."," The purpose of this article is to unify both valence dimensions of economic voting into a single incumbent vote model. Previous valence model research has primarily focused on the impact of retrospective economic evaluations, with little attention paid to the second dimension of issue ownership. However, a few studies have considered this aspect in more detail. In a time of economic crisis, it is particularly important to take account of both dimensions, as the economy's impact on incumbent voting can have a dual effect. Firstly, there is the traditional effect based on retrospective evaluations of national economic conditions, which are likely to be negative in a crisis context. Secondly, there is an effect based on perceptions of the parties' economic management competence. The extent to which this effect compensates for incumbent vote losses resulting from bad economic times depends on the public's perceptions."
" Our analysis is based on survey data from the 2008 and 2011 Canadian federal elections, and we have found that the impact of economic conditions on these elections was twofold. While economic factors did indeed play a role, the outcomes suggest that voters were also influenced by other considerations beyond the economy. This suggests that traditional economic voting models may not be able to fully account for the complex interplay of factors that shape electoral outcomes in a given context, and that more nuanced models may be needed to better understand the dynamics of these processes."," Our study utilized survey responses from the 2008 and 2011 Canadian federal elections to examine the impact of economic conditions on voting behavior. While our findings confirmed that economic factors did indeed affect voters' decisions, we also found evidence of a more complex set of influences on electoral outcomes. Specifically, factors beyond the economy seemed to play a role, suggesting that we need to consider a range of unique and context-specific factors when attempting to develop a comprehensive understanding of how elections unfold."," Our analysis of electoral outcomes in Canada's 2008 and 2011 federal elections was based on data derived from surveys. While we hypothesized that voters' decisions would be influenced largely by a prevailing economic climate, we found that other factors beyond the economy were also important in shaping electoral outcomes. These results suggest that simplistic models of economic voting may not be sufficient to accurately capture the complexity of factors at play in driving election results. Understanding these multidimensional influences more fully may require more nuanced models of analysis."
" When it comes to federal elections in Canada, the country has seen five instances where national economic crises either coincided with, or followed the election year. In three of these instances, i.e., during the 1974, 2008, and 2011 elections, the incumbent party won, while in the remaining two, during the 1984 and 1993 elections, the incumbent party faced defeat. The implications of these outcomes are puzzling, as they contradict the traditional economic voting theory that suggests an incumbent party's defeat in such scenarios. As a response to this, the authors discuss two valence dimensions of economic voting, namely, the classic dimension and the issue ownership dimension, that could provide an explanation. Further, the two Canadian elections are examined to test the proposed explanation."," There have been five federal elections in Canada that have coincided with or followed an economic crisis. Surprisingly, the ruling party emerged victorious in three of these elections (1974, 2008, 2011). However, the remaining two elections (1984, 1993) saw crushing defeats for the incumbents. These results seem to contradict the economic voting theory, which predicts that an incumbent party's defeat is imminent when an economic crisis is ongoing or recovering. In this article, the authors put forth an idea that distinguishes between two different valence dimensions associated with economic voting - the classic dimension and the issue ownership dimension - and delve deeper into the two elections that saw the most significant outcomes. Further details regarding their expectations and theoretical considerations are discussed in the next sections."," Throughout the history of federal elections in Canada, there have been five occasions when the country was undergoing or recovering from an economic crisis. Curiously, during the 1974, 2008, and 2011 elections, which were held amidst such crises, the incumbent party was reelected, while the opposite occurred during the 1984 and 1993 elections. These results appear counterintuitive to the classic economic voting theory, which anticipates that incumbents should lose in all such scenarios. To address this puzzle, the authors introduce the concepts of classic economic voting and issue ownership dimensions and go in-depth into two Canadian elections to test their idea. The next two sections provide a more detailed and extensive discussion of their theoretical framework and expectations."
" The idea that there is a connection between the economy and incumbent voting is based on the notion that politicians should be held responsible for the economic conditions. This, in turn, implies that citizens will reward or punish governments depending on whether the economic situation is positive or negative. While this hypothesis has predominantly been studied in the United States, it has also been found to hold true in most Western democracies. Recent comparative research on this topic has examined the relationship by considering institutional arrangements and the level of political awareness among voters, as seen in works such as Powell and Whitten (1993) and Anderson (2007)."," The theory that there exists a connection between the economy and incumbent voting is based on the principle of government accountability. Citizen will typically reward or punish the incumbent party according to how they perceive the prevailing economic conditions. This link has been studied extensively in the United States, and recent comparative studies have found that the relationship between the economy and incumbent voting appears to hold in most Western democracies as well. Scholars have examined this link more closely by taking into consideration the role of institutional arrangements, and also by accounting for the level of sophistication among voters, as seen in works such as Powell and Whitten (1993) and Anderson (2007)."," The relationship between the economy and voting patterns has been a subject of much research, particularly in the United States.

Comparative studies have recently considered the conditions or factors that impact this relationship, including institutional arrangements and voters¡¯ political awareness. Notable works in this area include Powell and Whitten's (1993) and Anderson's (2007) research."
" The 'valence' model, which Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011) introduce as an essential expectation, is distinguished from the other two economic voting models, namely policy-oriented economic voting and patrimonial economic voting. The economy serves as a positional issue in policy-oriented economic voting, whereas patrimonial economic voting is based on the correlation between financial assets and vote preferences. According to Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011), economic voting has a multidimensional nature. Our article's contention is that, by adding party competence as a second valence dimension, the valence model of economic voting becomes multidimensional."," The fundamental expectation for economic voting is presented as the 'valence' model by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011), which demonstrates a different approach from the other two models of economic voting: policy-oriented economic voting and patrimonial economic voting. Whereas policy-oriented economic voting refers to voters' varying opinions about economic policies, patrimonial economic voting is influenced by an individual's financial assets. According to Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011), economic voting is a complex phenomenon with multiple dimensions. Our article contends that by incorporating party competence as a second valence dimension, the valence model of economic voting becomes a multidimensional approach."," The 'valence' model, introduced by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011), establishes the expectation that forms the core of economic voting. Policy-oriented economic voting, on the other hand, focuses on the economy as a positional issue, with voters having diverging opinions on specific economic policies associated with political parties. The third model, patrimonial economic voting, relates to a person's financial assets, which can influence their vote preferences. According to Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011), economic voting is an intricate concept with multiple perspectives. In our article, we argue that party competence should be added as a second valence dimension to create a multidimensional approach to the valence model of economic voting."
" The prevailing theory of economic voting posits that voters base their decisions on the incumbent party's economic performance over the previous year. Valence models of political choice suggest that voters also consider the incumbent's comparative performance and image when deciding which party to vote for. A number of recent studies have explored the impact of the economy on voting, with a particular focus on political parties' perceived ability to handle economic issues. Research by scholars such as Sanders, Bellucci, Butt, Smith, Martinsson, B¨¦langer, and G¨¦lineau has highlighted the importance of competence in shaping voters' views on the economy and ultimately influencing their decisions at the ballot box."," Economic voting theory suggests that voters prioritize the economic performance of the incumbent party in the past year when they cast their ballots. Valence models of political choice go further to propose that voters also consider the relative performance and reputation of the incumbent party.

" During times of financial turmoil, it can be challenging for the incumbent party to gain electoral leverage. As such, they may opt to focus their campaign efforts on a different issue aside from the economy, as suggested by Vavreck (2009). Alternatively, they could still campaign on the economic platform, but they would need to present it in a more positive light, as to project a more favorable image compared to their opponents. This strategy recommended by Nadeau et al. (2010) emphasizes the importance of a party's economic competence as it becomes a determining factor in their campaign message."," When faced with a financial crisis, the incumbent party may not benefit much from the struggling economy in terms of gaining an electoral advantage. In such cases, they may choose to focus their campaign efforts on a different issue, according to Vavreck (2009). The incumbent party may still campaign on the economy, but it would need to be framed in a more favorable and positive light, as advised by Nadeau et al. (2010). In this context, the economic competence of a party can play a key role in determining its campaign message and ultimately influence the voters."," In the midst of financial crisis, the incumbent party's chances of winning the election may be slim due to unfavorable economic conditions. As a result, the incumbent may choose to shift their focus towards a different issue, according to Vavreck (2009). Alternatively, they may still choose to emphasize the economy in their campaign message, but it would require framing the issue in a more favorable light, as suggested by Nadeau et al. (2010). With economic competence being a key component of a party's campaign message, their ability to present themselves positively to voters and differentiate themselves from opponents could ultimately be a determining factor in securing an election win."
" The economic valence dimension can be split into two parts, with the second part having a retrospective nature. The crucial difference between the traditional and alternative valence dimension is that while the traditional dimension focuses solely on the incumbent party's economics record, the alternative competence dimension is comparative. It involves voters evaluating the incumbent party's economic performance against other economies. In times of crisis, voters tend to benchmark the nation's economy's performance against comparable economies. If the nation's economy is doing better than these other economies, then the incumbent party is perceived to have done a good job, even in difficult times. This cognitive process is referred to as benchmarking by Kayser and Peress (2012) and signals extraction by Duch and Stevenson (2010)."," According to the economic valence dimension, the second aspect of the economy is retrospective in nature. However, it differs from the traditional valence dimension in a fundamental way. Instead of solely focusing on the incumbent party's economic record, the competence dimension takes a more comparative approach. It involves voters assessing the incumbent's economic performance in relation to other economies. During challenging times, voters may ask if the national economy is outperforming other comparable economies. If it performs better, then the incumbent party may be perceived to have done relatively well despite the crisis, and voters may choose to support them. This cognitive process is known as benchmarking by Kayser and Peress (2012) and signals extraction by Duch and Stevenson (2010)."," The economic valence dimension has two parts, with the second part being retrospective. However, it differs from the traditional valence dimension in a significant way. The competence dimension takes a comparative approach to assess the incumbent's economic performance in terms of other countries. In times of crisis, voters tend to compare the national economy's performance with that of comparable economies. Incorporating the context into their evaluation of performance, voters conclude that if the economy is performing better than other countries, the incumbent party has done relatively well under tough circumstances. This cognitive process can be referred to as 'benchmarking' by Kayser and Peress (2012), while Duch and Stevenson (2010) conceptualize it as signal extraction by voters of the government's economic competence relative to other countries."
" Issue ownership has two components - competence-based and associative. The former is concerned with how well political parties handle specific issues, and it can be measured by comparison and benchmarking. In the case of the economy, benchmarking can be particularly useful. The latter component is more about the historical attention given to specific issues by political parties based on their policy priorities. This is less focused on actual performance than the competence-based component. It is worth noting that Walgrave et al (2012) have discussed the crucial distinction between these two dimensions of issue ownership. This distinction is similar to the one presented by Kiewiet's (1983) policy-oriented view of economic voting and the traditional economic voting hypothesis."," The competence-based component of issue ownership refers to the ability of political parties to handle specific issues, and it can be evaluated by comparing their performance. To this end, benchmarking tools can be used, especially for economic issues. It is distinct from the associative component, which is more concerned with the historical attention allocated by parties to certain issues based on their policies. Importantly, this dimension of issue ownership is not as much about actual performance as the competence-based component. The distinction between the valence and policy dimensions of issue ownership aligns with the dichotomy between the traditional economic voting hypothesis and Kiewiet's policy-oriented view of economic voting, as previously discussed. Walgrave et al (2012) have provided an account of this distinction that is fundamental to our understanding of issue ownership."," Issue ownership has two components - competence-based and associative. The competence-based dimension concerns the parties' ability to handle and perform well in specific issues, which can be measured through comparison and benchmarking. Benchmarking can be particularly beneficial in the case of the economy. The associative component is more focused on the history of attention given to specific issues by political parties and their policy priorities. Although less about actual performance, it is still an important aspect of issue ownership. Walgrave et al (2012) have highlighted the critical distinction between these two dimensions of issue ownership, which is supported by the valence and policy dimensions of issue ownership as evidenced by Kiewiet's (1983) policy-oriented view of economic voting and traditional economic voting hypothesis."
" Martinsson's (2009, p. 230) argument agrees with ours that issue ownership plays an integral role in why incumbents can avoid punishment for poor economic performance. While previous studies have looked into various institutional and contextual factors to explain this phenomenon (as reviewed in Anderson, 2007), they have neglected to analyze the parties' image as economic managers. Issue ownership, in our view, is a key factor in economic voting that should be widely acknowledged."," Incumbents who perform poorly in the economy may avoid punishment due to the concept of issue ownership, an important factor that we and Martinsson (2009, p. 230) have addressed.

" The level of competency in managing the economy has been identified as a crucial factor influencing incumbent voting in the Canadian federal elections of 2008 and 2011. As per the study, the perception of the incumbent party being the most capable at managing the economy led to a greater support for the Conservative Party. Similarly, the perception of the opposition party being the most capable reduced support. B¨¦langer and G¨¦lineau previously analyzed similar effects in the 2008 Quebec election, while Martinsson's study focused on the issue of unemployment in six Swedish national elections.

" In order to assess retrospective sociotropic economic evaluations, we make use of two measures sequentially. Initially, the classic measure based on the question ""Has Canada's economy improved, worsened, or remain the same over the past year?"" (better=+1, same=0, worse=-1) is used to detect the traditional economic voting effect. However, according to Gidengil et al (2012, p. 77), this measure had a mediocre impact in their investigation of economic voting in the 2008 Canadian election. They argue that many voters did not ascribe the responsibility of the country's economic downturn to the Conservative government, owing to the fact that the financial crisis had mostly occurred in the United States (Gidengil et al, 2012, pp. 79-82). Consequently, we created another measure of retrospective economic evaluations that considers responsibility attribution. The 'economic responsibility' measure evaluates the original variable of economic perceptions by weighting it based on whether the respondent identifies the government's policies for good or bad national economic conditions."," To analyze retrospective sociotropic economic evaluations, we use two measures in succession. Our first measure involves the standard inquiry on whether the Canadian economy has improved, worsened, or stayed consistent in the last year (better=+1, same=0, worse=-1). This measure can highlight the traditional economic voting effect. However, Gidengil et al (2012, p. 77) noted its limited impact when investigating economic voting during the 2008 Canadian election. The researchers found that the economic downturn was attributed to the United States, and not the Conservative government, by many voters (Gidengil et al, 2012, pp. 79-82). Thus, we devised a second measure for retrospective economic evaluations, which considers responsibility attribution. This ""economic responsibility"" measure measures economic perceptions based on whether the respondent attributes good or bad national economic conditions to the government's policies."," In order to evaluate retrospective sociotropic economic assessments, we use two measures consecutively.

However, Gidengil et al (2012, p. 77) report that this measure's effect was minimal in their inquest of economic voting during the 2008 Canadian election. The researchers contend that many voters didn't hold the Conservative government responsible for the economic downturn since it mainly occurred in the United States (Gidengil et al, 2012, pp. 79-82).

This measure, named ""economic responsibility,"" evaluates economic perceptions based on whether the respondent attributes good or bad national economic conditions to the government's policies."
" To evaluate political parties' image as competent economic managers, the study uses respondents' answers to the question 'Which party do you believe is best at dealing with the economy?' This measure of the competency variable is coded in a three-category code, where a response favoring the Conservative Party is coded as +1, while naming another party as competent is coded as -1. Responses categorized as none, equally competent, or unsure are coded as 0. The questionnaire for the 2008 survey uses a random split-sample experiment in which only one half of the sample answers the economic management question, while the other half responds to the job creation issue. The study analyzes the additional evidence of economic voting's contribution by considering respondents' assessments of political parties concerning job creation, which is pertinent to the context of the economic crisis. Overall, the methodology of the study bears some resemblance to that of previous research by B¨¦langer and Meguid (2008) and B¨¦langer and G¨¦lineau (2011)."," The study measures political parties' perceived competency in economic management based on respondents' responses to the question 'Which party do you believe is most capable of handling the country's economic issues?'

In the 2008 survey, the study uses a random split-sample experiment in which only one half of the population answers the economic management query, while the other half responds to their estimation of the best party for job creation. Since job creation is relevant to the economic crisis context, the researchers view this as an additional indication of economic voting and consider it in the analysis. The study's approach is similar to that of B¨¦langer and Meguid (2008) and B¨¦langer and G¨¦lineau (2011), which also uses a three-point scale to assess perceived political party competency."," The study's measure of political parties' perceived competency in managing the economy is derived from respondents' answers to the question 'Which political party do you think would do the best job in handling economic issues?'

" The 2008 Canadian federal election took place when Prime Minister Stephen Harper was in power, and he called for it just before the American economic crisis in the housing and financial markets erupted. During the election period, Canadians were aware of their economy's current state and that it was slowing down and possibly collapsing in the near future. According to CES data, 81% of the respondents outside Quebec felt that the economy was essential in that election, while 17% believed that it was not that significant. After the economic downturn, 46% of respondents thought that Canada's economy had deteriorated, while 39% saw no changes in the economy. Only 14% of Canadians who responded thought that the economy had improved. Incumbent Conservatives may have been affected by these negative economic evaluations, according to the traditional economic voting hypothesis."," Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister of Canada, called for the 2008 federal elections just before the economic crisis erupted in the American housing and financial markets. Canadians were gearing up to vote on 14 October against the backdrop of the ongoing crisis, and given that the Canadian economy had started to slow down, voters were aware that it could possibly collapse over the next few months. As per CES data, 81% of respondents from areas outside of Quebec highlighted the economy's importance in the election, with an additional 17% considering it to be somewhat important. It wasn't surprising that, given the start of the economic decline, 46% of respondents felt that Canada's economy had deteriorated, while 39% thought that it was unchanged. In contrast, only 14% believed that Canada's economy had improved. Based on the traditional economic voting hypothesis, it was expected that these negative economic evaluations would adversely affect the incumbent Conservatives."," The Canadian federal elections of 2008 were called by the then-Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, before the financial and housing crises in the United States shook the world. As Canadians headed to the polls on 14 October, they were mindful of the aftermath of these crises, with the country's economy already showing signs of a slowdown and a possible impending collapse. The CES survey data revealed that over 80% of respondents outside of Quebec deemed the economy to be an essential election issue, while another 17% thought of it as somewhat important. Given the onset of the economic recession, an overwhelming 46% of respondents believed that Canada's economy had declined in the past year. Furthermore, only 14% felt that it had improved, while 39% deemed it unchanged. The traditional economic voting hypothesis suggests that these adverse sentiments would have hurt the incumbent Conservative government."
" The regression analysis in Column 2 of Table 1 involves a different approach than the first model, as it utilizes the 5-point economic responsibility measure in place of the conventional 3-point measure of past economic assessments. It is noteworthy, however, that both indicators have been standardized to a range of ?1 to +1. The findings reveal that economic voting persists even when using the economic responsibility indicator, a result that is consistent with Gidengil et al's (2012) view on the nature of economic voting in the context of the 2008 Canadian election. In times of global financial crisis, an incumbent government's liability for a country's crumbling economic conditions can only be attributed to voters who find fault in its policies, and this is what the economic responsibility indicator intends to capture. It is important to underscore that economic voting did take place in 2008 and had an adverse effect on the incumbent party because most voters in Canada felt that economic conditions had either deteriorated or at the very least, had not improved. Nevertheless, this phenomenon was most evident among those individuals who placed responsibility or credits on the government's policies, with all other factors being equal."," In Column 2 of Table 1, a regression model introduces a new approach by using the 5-point economic responsibility measure instead of the traditional 3-point measure of past economic assessments. It should be noted that both measures have been standardized to run from ?1 to +1. The results of this new model indicate that economic voting remains a prominent factor, just as it did in the first model with the use of the conventional measure. This finding aligns with Gidengil et al's (2012) interpretation of economic voting in the context of the 2008 Canadian election. In a time of global economic crisis, an incumbent government cannot be held solely accountable for a country's worsening economic circumstances; only those voters who implicate its policies can be anticipated to vote against it, which is precisely what the economic responsibility measure tries to capture. It is significant to stress that economic voting did transpire in 2008 and adversely affected the incumbents since most Canadian voters believed that the economic conditions had either not improved or had worsened. However, this occurred more strongly among those who gave credit or blame to the government's policies, all other things being equal."," Table 1's Column 2 features a regression model that presents a distinct methodology compared to the traditional three-point measure of past economic assessments. It instead employs the five-point economic responsibility measure, with both measures standardized to operate between ?1 and +1. The results indicate a considerable presence of economic voting, much like that in the previous model utilizing the standard measure. This outcome is in line with Gidengil et al's (2012) perspective on the nature of economic voting in the context of the Canadian election held in 2008. In times of worldwide economic downturns, an incumbent government cannot hold complete responsibility for a country's deteriorating economic conditions; only those voters who criticize its policies should be expected to cast a vote against it, and that is precisely what the economic responsibility measure attempts to measure. To be clear, economic voting did happen in 2008 and had adverse outcomes for the incumbent party since most Canadians believed that the economic circumstances had deteriorated or at least not improved. However, the phenomenon was most pronounced among those who gave credit or blame to the government's policies, with all else held constant."
" Despite the close similarity between the two models of Table 1, there is a slight difference in terms of model fit. Nevertheless, it appears that responsibility attributions have only a minor role to play in the traditional economic voting effect. While attributions of responsibility do add an important layer of complexity, they do not significantly increase the explanatory power of the model, as the article argues. Indeed, a singular focus on retroactive economic attitudes is not sufficient to fully understand the intricacies of economic voting in times of financial crisis. The article postulates that, during difficult economic periods, the competence of political parties in managing economic affairs can act as both a mitigating and reinforcing influence."," A minute difference in model fit is evident between the two models in Table 1. However, it appears that the inclusion of responsibility attributions only plays a minor role in the traditional economic voting effect. Although attributions of responsibility add a layer of nuance to the effect, the model's explanatory power does not increase substantially. The article makes the case that relying solely on past economic perceptions is not enough to fully comprehend the mechanisms of economic voting, particularly during financial crises. As predicted, the competence of political parties in managing the economy can either counteract or reinforce perceptions of the economy during tough times."," The difference in model fit between the two models of Table 1 is insignificant, notwithstanding the inclusion of responsibility attributions. The article suggests that responsibility attributions are only minimally impactful on the traditional economic voting effect. Although responsibility attributions do provide some additional insight, they do not significantly enhance the model's explanatory power. The article underscores the inadequacy of solely retrospective economic perceptions in understanding economic voting, particularly in times of financial crises. As hypothesized, perceptions of the competence of political parties to manage the economy can either reinforce or counteract the effects of economic perceptions during trying times."
" Investigating the impact of the two valence dimensions of economic voting on the likelihood of supporting the incumbent party, with everything else being equal, is the focus of this analysis. The researchers have employed logistic regression to transform the results into marginal effects, aiming to provide more concrete evidence. They have utilized the results of the enhanced valence model of economic voting estimated for 2008 as the basis, but the findings are comparable when using alternative results from other models, such as those of the jobs creation model of 2008. By holding other independent variables at mean values and altering the values of retrospective national economic evaluations and party competence on the economy, researchers have computed the corresponding change in the predicted probability to vote for the incumbent party. The resultant simulation results have been tabulated in Table 8 for reference."," The purpose of this study is to examine the extent to which the two valence dimensions of economic voting affect the likelihood of supporting the incumbent party, assuming that all other variables remain constant. The results have been transformed into marginal effects using logistic regression, providing more tangible evidence. The 2008 enhanced valence model of economic voting serves as the basis, but results are similar for other models such as 2011 regression results or those of the 2008 jobs creation model. While keeping all other independent variables constant, the values of retrospective national economic evaluations and party competence on the economy were modified to calculate the impact on the anticipated likelihood of voting for the incumbent party. Table 8 shows the simulation results resulting from these adjustments."," This research aims to measure the effect of the two valence dimensions of economic voting on the propensity to support the incumbent party, with other variables remaining constant. The findings of this study have been converted into marginal effects through logistic regression in order to better illustrate the impact.

" Traditional neoclassical economic theory has overlooked the role of economic emergence and entrepreneurship, as they are not included in the standard approach to economic theorizing. We investigate how mainstream economic theory has excluded entrepreneurship from economic analysis despite being a fundamental aspect of economic behavior. On the other hand, evolutionary economists have acknowledged the importance of understanding economic emergence and have made significant advances in this field. We argue that evolutionary economics can further promote economic evolution by adopting a more naturalistic approach to economic analysis, incorporating complex economic system theories and considering how people react to states of uncertainty. Because of the presence of uncertainty in economic systems, we suggest that knowledge is conjectural and closely linked to human emotions. Furthermore, our economic behavior is influenced by the reality that we, and the systems we create, are dissipative structures, leading to important concepts such as ""energy gradients"" and ""knowledge gradients"" that play critical roles in economic emergence and growth."," The traditional approach to economic theorizing followed by mainstream neoclassical economists does not incorporate the role of economic emergence or entrepreneurship. We delve into why entrepreneurship, a significant economic activity, is mostly neglected in economic theory. Meanwhile, evolutionary economists have recognized the importance of economic emergence and have made progress towards understanding it. We suggest that evolutionary economics can advance further if it adopts a more naturalistic approach, involving the integration of complex economic system theories that explicitly account for how people react to states of uncertainty. As uncertainty exists in economic systems, we argue that knowledge is, to a considerable extent, conjectural and tied to human emotions. Our economic behavior is also affected by our status as dissipative structures, leading to the critical concepts of ""energy gradients"" and ""knowledge gradients"" that underpin economic emergence and growth."," The standard neoclassical approach to economic theorizing omits economic emergence and entrepreneurship by definition, which has been a cause of concern. We examine how entrepreneurship, a central economic behavior, has been sidelined in mainstream economic theory. In contrast, evolutionary economists have recognized the significance of understanding economic emergence and have made impressive strides in this field. We posit that evolutionary economics can make further inroads by adopting a more naturalistic approach to economic evolution. This entails fully integrating economic analysis with complex economic system theory and explicitly addressing how people react to situations of uncertainty. We suggest that due to the existence of uncertainty, knowledge becomes conjectural and is strongly linked to our emotional state. Our economic behavior is influenced by our existence as dissipative structures, resulting in the critical concepts of ""energy gradients"" and ""knowledge gradients"" that are fundamental in understanding economic emergence and growth."
" Conventional economic theory is rooted in the belief that decision making in the marketplace is guided by rational self-interest and constrained optimization. While this provides a useful framework for understanding simple transactions under conditions of full knowledge, the real world is typically characterized by uncertainty, asymmetric information, and other factors that make this model problematic. As a result, economists have increasingly explored alternative approaches that emphasize the role of institutions, social norms, and other factors that shape economic behavior. These approaches focus on the emergence of social networks and the formation of collective action to achieve economic goals. By seeking to understand how these factors interact and shape individual behavior, these theories provide a more nuanced view of economic activity that can help us better understand the complex dynamics of modern economies."," Traditional economic theories typically assume that economic agents make rational decisions based on perfect information and are motivated solely by self-interest. However, this view has been challenged by newer schools of thought which suggest that emotions, social norms, and other factors can play an important role in shaping economic behavior. For example, recent research has shown that social networks can have a significant impact on economic outcomes by shaping individual behavior and facilitating the diffusion of information. Similarly, behavioral economics has highlighted the ways in which cognitive biases and heuristics can lead individuals to make suboptimal decisions, even in the absence of external constraints. These alternative approaches provide valuable insights into the complex and dynamic landscape of modern economic activity, and are essential for developing more accurate and effective policy interventions."," Mainstream economic theory assumes that individuals are motivated solely by rational self-interest, and that markets always tend towards equilibrium. However, this perspective has been criticized as being overly simplistic and unrealistic. One alternative approach is institutional economics, which recognizes the importance of culture, norms, and institutions in shaping economic behavior. This perspective suggests that economic activity is embedded within social, political, and cultural contexts, and that these factors can have a significant influence on economic outcomes. For example, institutional economists argue that legal frameworks, property rights, and other institutions can shape patterns of investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity. Similarly, cultural values and social norms can influence labor market outcomes and the diffusion of new technologies. By recognizing the ways in which economic activity is embedded in broader social structures, institutional economics provides a more nuanced and realistic view of economic behavior, and has important implications for economic policy."
" Evolutionary economics is the school of thought that is most closely associated with the concept of economic emergence. This connection has been possible as evolutionary economists focus on how economic systems evolve from within. Evolutionary theory fundamentally involves change, which is embodied by multiple behavioural rules adopted by economic decision-makers. Nelson and Winter (1982) emphasized the importance of behavioural routines that economic agents have to follow, given that they need to operate in the context of historical time, which incorporates uncertainties. According to evolutionary economics, economic agents decrease the uncertainty they encounter and attain their economic objectives by adhering to collections of rules. Economic emergence comes into play as original sets of rules tangentially develop into technological rules, organizational rules, institutional rules, and procedural rules that contribute to capital goods, productive networks, contracting systems, and human skills. The emergence is a result of self-organization shaped by a process of competitive selection that identifies the dominating technologies, organizational structures, institutions, and procedures."," Evolutionary economics is the field of study that primarily deals with the phenomenon of economic emergence. This is due to its focus on how economic systems undergo internal transformations. Evolutionary theory, inherently based on change, embodies a range of behavioural rules adopted by economic decision-makers. Nelson and Winter (1982) highlighted the central role of behavioural routines since economic agents have to operate in a historical context with several uncertainties. In evolutionary economics, economic agents minimize the uncertainty they encounter and achieve their economic goals by following sets of rules. Economic emergence occurs when novel sets of rules develop into capital goods (technological rules), productive networks (organizational rules), contracting systems (institutional rules), and human skills (procedural rules). This emergence is a process of self-organization shaped by competitive selection, where particular technologies, organizational structures, institutions, and procedures become dominant."," The concept of economic emergence has been mainly addressed in the field of evolutionary economics. This is because evolutionary economists focus on how economic systems transform from within. Evolutionary theory, being a theory of change, reflects several behavioural rules adopted by economic decision-makers. Nelson and Winter (1982) underscored the importance of behavioural routines in this regard since decision-makers need to operate in historical time, which is full of uncertainties. In evolutionary economics, economic agents reduce the uncertainty they face and achieve their objectives by following a bundle of rules. The emergence of economic systems happens when new bundles of rules give rise to capital goods (technological rules), productive networks (organizational rules), contracting systems (institutional rules), and procedural rules (human skills). This emergence process is self-organizing and honed by a competitive selection process whereby specific technologies, organizational structures, institutions, and procedures gain dominance."
" To fully grasp the concept of economic emergence, one must delve into both the genetic and cultural factors that influence human behavior, taking into account our evolutionary history as a species. Additionally, one must understand how these factors contribute to the energetic requirements of living, dissipative systems. It is crucial to recognize the institutional rules that are adopted by different cultures and how these adapt to changing circumstances, as this is essential for analyzing economic behavior. Although traditional economic analysis approaches are valid, they do not cover the full scope of human behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the diversity of behaviors instead of pursuing a uniform approach, which is at the core of all evolutionary theories. So, the question of whether behavior is optimal based on logical criteria is secondary to understanding how individuals respond to the available information under different circumstances."," Economic emergence can be better understood by examining both the biological and social determinants of human behavior, which have developed over our evolutionary history. In addition, it's also essential to consider the energetic requirements of various living systems and how they affect human behavior. Analyzing economic behavior necessitates an in-depth comprehension of the institutional rules that govern diverse cultures and how they transform when underlying conditions change. While conventional economic analysis is relevant, it must be acknowledged that individuals tend to act rationally given the particular circumstances they confront as opposed to being perfectly rational. In light of that, the issue at hand is not optimizing behavior in every instance, but rather understanding the limitations of calculative behavior and how individuals can respond to the information at their disposal. Given that, the primary focus of evolutionary theories is to place the importance on the diversity rather than the uniformity of human behavior."," A thorough understanding of economic emergence requires an exploration of both biological and cultural factors that influence human behavior, formed through our anthropological history. Additionally, it is necessary to examine how energetic requirements of living systems interface with human behavior. Before analyzing economic behavior, it is essential to recognize the institutional rules that humans adopt in various cultures, and how these transform when subjected to changing circumstances. Traditional economic analysis is useful, but it's essential to remember that humans don't always act rationally given the situation they are in. The focus of all evolutionary theories is on the diversity of behaviors exhibited by humans, which is much more important than optimizing behavior by logical criteria. Understanding the limitations of calculative behavior and the different ways in which individuals respond to the available information is the key to analyzing economic behavior."

" During the 1950s, economics took on a new logic that was not able to accommodate emergent phenomena. This approach neglected important drivers of economic growth and instead relied on the mathematics of constrained optimization, which was based on a force field representation of a fully connected network system borrowed from 19th century physics. Although there was skepticism about the neoclassical approach in the wake of the Keynesian revolution, it persisted in microeconomics while macroeconomics shifted to a non-neoclassical outlook, featuring medium-term multiplier-accelerator models and Harrod's theory as the baseline for analysis of economic growth and development planning."," The 1950s saw economics move towards a logical framework that was ill-equipped to handle emergent phenomena. This approach overlooked crucial factors driving economic evolution and instead focused on the mathematics of constrained optimization, adopting a force field representation of a fully connected network system that was originally developed for 19th century physics. While the Keynesian revolution challenged the validity of neoclassical economics as an adequate representation of economic behavior, the neoclassical tradition remained dominant in the field of microeconomics. On the other hand, macroeconomics took on a markedly non-neoclassical flavor, with a medium-term multiplier-accelerator representation of the business cycle becoming popular, and Harrod's theory emerging as the preferred analytical basis for economic growth, as well as development planning."," In the 1950s, economics drifted towards a logical framework that was ill-suited to address emergent phenomena.

" Neoclassical economists believed that the solution to dealing with technological change in growth models was not simply finding ways to adapt, but rather improving the underlying microfoundations of macroeconomics. This viewpoint was influenced by the neoclassical synthesis interpretation of Keynesian economics, which gained acceptance after John Hicks introduced it in 1937. As a result, neoclassical economists were able to expand their influence in the fields of business cycle and growth theory in the following decades. However, these models were often complex and did not have clear equilibrium solutions, making it difficult to verify them empirically. Instead of dealing with this complexity, neoclassical economists opted for simple analytical frameworks based on the concept of representative optimizing agents, which made it easier to understand and apply theoretical assumptions, but ultimately failed to capture the nuances of economic emergence that come from differentiated firms, entrepreneurial activity, and market innovation."," The response of neoclassical economists to technological change in growth models differed from other schools of thought. Instead of focusing on adapting to technological change, these economists believed that the solution was to improve the microfoundations of macroeconomics. This viewpoint was shaped by the neoclassical synthesis interpretation of Keynesian economics, which Hicks introduced in 1937. Subsequently, neoclassical economists were able to make inroads into the fields of business cycle and growth theory in the following decades. However, the complicated mathematical models that emerged were often inelegant and lacked empirical evidence, leading neoclassical economists to opt for simple models based on the concept of representative optimizing agents. While these models were easy to apply with clear assumptions, they failed to capture economic emergence, which involves entrepreneurial activity, innovation, and differentiated firms."," Rather than address technological change in growth models, neoclassical economists contended that better macroeconomics required improved 'microfoundations'. After Keynes passed, the neoclassical synthesis of Keynesian analysis rose to sway, giving these economists a foothold into business cycle and growth theory. Emerging growth and cycle mathematical representations revealed messiness and complexity, lacking equilibrium solutions, and were challenging for empirical confirmation. Neoclassical economists attempted to undermine these difficulties with the foundation of analysts' simplified assumptions regarding representative optimizing agents. This approach, however, could not handle economic emergence since it lacked a connection to Schumpeter's entrepreneur, the Marshallian flux, or differentiated firms."
" During the mid-20th century, the economics field became increasingly consolidated around the concept of constrained optimization as a means of appearing more scientific. However, in doing so, neoclassical rationality became the sole focus, limiting consideration for behavioral traits and emergence within economic theory. This ultimately resulted in a lack of recognition and understanding of the warning signs leading up to the global financial crisis of 2008. Even though John Maynard Keynes' theory of 'animal spirits' influencing business investment provided valuable insight, it was ultimately dismissed by those adhering to the neoclassical synthesis model, leading to an oversimplified explanation of economic fluctuations as labor market failure."," In the latter half of the 20th century, the economics discipline became more focused on constrained optimization in an attempt to attain a sense of scientific legitimacy. In doing so, economists discontinued the relevance of economic emergence, and largely disregarded the importance of behavioral traits which were not in line with the narrow neoclassical rationality model. This approach proved to be detrimental, as the majority of economists failed to take note of the brewing global financial crisis in the early 21st century. John Maynard Keynes' notion of 'animal spirits' influencing business investment was not compatible with the neoclassical synthesis model and hence, it remained mostly unrecognized. Moreover, his Keynesian story was simplified as labor market failure in a non-neoclassical world, disassociating it from the complexity of economic dynamics."," In the second half of the 20th century, the economics field underwent a significant consolidation of its constrained optimization core in a bid to establish itself as a more scientific discipline. This shift, however, resulted in the abandonment of economic emergence and the exclusion of behavioral traits beyond the confines of the narrow neoclassical definition of rational thinking. This way of thinking proved to be shortsighted, culminating in the general inattention of economists towards the global financial crisis that was looming in the first decade of the 21st century. John Maynard Keynes' proposal of 'animal spirits' driving business investment was shunned as it did not align with the neoclassical synthesis, thereby reducing the Keynesian story to a labor market failure in an otherwise well-functioning non-neoclassical framework."
" During the 1990s, some growth theorists proposed a new idea to explain Solow's unexplained residual. They suggested that by introducing 'knowledge' as a unique production factor with properties that could lead to economies of scale and externalities, the residual could be explained. This theory was based on neoclassical principles, where new knowledge is generated through research and development, which produces groundbreaking inventions that can be transformed into new capital equipment and sold to producers of consumer goods. Despite the use of certain assumptions and functional forms, the theory only confirmed what we already know, that investment in education and training is critical, that innovation must be promoted and facilitated, and that patents are vital but must not be overly restrictive. Despite aspiring to be explanatory, equilibrium endogenous growth theory lacks any explanation of the process of economic emergence, and it virtually ignores the key driver of economic growth, namely entrepreneurship."," The endogenous growth theorists believed that Solow's unexplained residual could be understood by introducing a unique factor in production known as 'knowledge'. By attributing this new factor to produce economies of scale or externalities, they believed that the issue of Solow's residual could be resolved.

Although the theory requires clever assumptions and functional forms to function, it merely confirms what we already know, identifying that investment in education and training is crucial, new innovation must be facilitated and promoted, while caution should be exercised in protecting patents. Despite aspiring to be an explanatory theory, the equilibrium endogenous growth theory falls short, devoid of an explanation for the economic emergence process, with entrepreneurship significantly disregarded as the key driver of economic growth."," Solow's unexplained residual in the early 1990s was a matter of concern for growth theorists. Some of these theorists suggested that introducing 'knowledge' as an additional factor of production with unique characteristics could explain the residual. This theory, based on neoclassical principles, postulates that knowledge is generated through research and development, with a subsequent innovation that can be transformed into capital equipment and sold to consumer goods producers. Nonetheless, while the theory is designed to explain the economics of growth, it merely affirms the importance of investing in education and training, promoting innovation and facilitating patents while being cautious not to overprotect. Nevertheless, the theory fails to explain the emergence of economics, and entrepreneurship is largely ignored as the prime driver of economic growth."
" The utilization of mathematical models to represent competition and innovation processes does not entirely negate the emergent character of such phenomena. However, these models can only capture ""weak"" emergence and not ""strong"" emergence associated with radical innovations and entrepreneurship. Emergent processes are instrumental in shaping economic growth trajectories, and as such, they must have a deterministic component as economic systems are dissipative structures that require structural coherence and some degree of irreversibility over time. Estimating this structural persistence can be achieved through econometrics; however, such quantitative modelling of growth trajectories remains a partial representation of an evolutionary process that is characterized by structural change. Econometrically estimated logistic diffusion models contain all the non-deterministic components of emergent processes and normal Gaussian stochasticity as statistical residuals."," The utilization of mathematical models to illustrate the processes of competition and innovation does not fully eliminate their emergent nature. However, these models can only represent ""weak"" emergence rather than the more intense ""strong"" emergence associated with Schumpeterian radical innovation and associated entrepreneurship. The deterministic component is crucial to the emergence processes that shape economic growth trajectories since economic systems are dissipative structures that require structural coherence for the long haul. Consequently, there is some irreversibility involved in the emergence process. This structural persistence is mathematically quantifiable through econometrics models, but it is not entirely representative of the intricate evolutionary process characterized by structural changes. Thus, the logistic diffusion models estimated with econometrics contain all the nondeterministic components of emergent processes and normal Gaussian stochasticity as statistical residuals."," The use of mathematical models to depict the processes of competition and innovation does not entirely eliminate their emergent nature.

" Evolutionary economists have made notable strides in their ability to tackle weak emergence both theoretically and empirically. Their keen understanding of the significance of strong emergence in economic growth and evolution is also noteworthy. While Joseph Schumpeter's seminal contributions have drawn attention to the crucial potential of entrepreneurship in driving economic emergence, evolutionary economists still face significant analytical challenges in this regard. There is much room for further development before a comprehensive treatment of economic emergence can be realized in the field of evolutionary economics."," The field of evolutionary economics has seen significant progress in addressing the concept of weak emergence both theoretically and practically. The importance of strong emergence as a critical source of economic growth and evolution has also been recognized by evolutionary economists. Although Joseph Schumpeter's seminal work on the significance of entrepreneurship in bringing about novelty in economic emergence has been widely acknowledged, there are still major analytical hurdles that must be overcome before evolutionary economists can fully address the subject. Further development in this field is required to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of economic emergence."," The domain of evolutionary economics has made remarkable strides in tackling weak emergence both theoretically and empirically. Moreover, evolutionary economists have also duly recognized the crucial role of strong emergence in the mechanism of economic growth and evolution.

" Emergence is a complex phenomenon that involves a holistic understanding of the relationship between different components of a system. In the context of mainstream economics, the concept has been recognized in the form of economies of scale and scope and learning curves. However, the application of this idea has been limited to models that do not take into account the role of entrepreneurship in the creation of emergent processes. In contrast, evolutionary economics and business strategy have explored the operation of entrepreneurial individuals or groups in creating networks, accessing energy sources, and using organizational rules to establish connections between different elements. Scholars in the field have explored this phenomenon through case studies or agent-based simulations, which have resulted in a deeper understanding of the complex nature of emergence."," Emergence refers to the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, which has long been recognized in mainstream economics.

" The ability of a company to adapt to changing circumstances is limited by its existing physical, cultural, conceptual, and organizational structures, creating a historical lock-in that impedes flexibility. To achieve greater efficiency, firms tend to favor specialization and tighter connections within networks, but overly specialized organizations are less adaptable, creating a dilemma. While industries as a whole may have greater adaptive potential than any specific firm, a solely rational approach can be counterproductive. An example of this can be seen in the case of IBM, which achieved high organizational efficiency but struggled to adapt to change, leading to the creation of a separate branch dedicated to innovating and creating personal computers. Complexity theory suggests that to optimize a whole system, individual components may have to behave suboptimally."," The complexity of a firm's physical, cultural, conceptual, and organizational structure can lead to its historical lock-in, which limits its ability to adapt to changes. Specialization is often chosen to increase efficiency in a firm, but this can make the company less flexible. This creates an evolutionary dilemma, where tighter specialized connections in networks increase efficiency but make adaptation more difficult. Individual firms have less potential for adaptation than the industry as a whole, making an overly rational approach a disadvantage. IBM is a famous example of this; the company became highly efficient in its organizational structure but struggled to adapt to changing times. To innovate and create personal computers, a separate branch had to be created. Complexity theory recognizes that optimizing a system often involves suboptimal behavior in individual components."," A company's existing physical, cultural, conceptual, and organizational structures can create a historical lock-in that limits its ability to adapt effectively. To improve efficiency, firms tend to adopt specialization and tight connections in their networks. However, this tendency toward specialization also reduces a firm's flexibility and makes it hard to adapt to new circumstances. This creates an evolutionary dilemma where a firm must decide between efficiency and adaptability. The industry as a whole often has more potential for adaptation than an individual firm, and an overly rational approach to business can hinder a company's adaptability. IBM is a paradigmatic example of this phenomenon; it achieved high levels of organizational efficiency but struggled to adapt to changing times, leading to the creation of a separate branch devoted to developing and creating the personal computer. Complexity theory suggests that optimizing a system may require accepting suboptimal performance from individual components."
" India's economy has made strides in recent years to increase its level of economic freedom and reduce government control. As a result, the country's policy structure has undergone several changes.

" ""Economic autonomy is the measure of how freely the market operates, guided by principles of voluntary transactions, fair competition, and ensuring the safety of individuals and property (Gwartney et al. 1996). The principal objective is to describe how the institutional structure influences economic policies (North 1990).

" According to the Fraser Institute, economic freedom comprises of five crucial components which are the size of the government, legal structure and the protection of property rights, sound money, the ability to trade freely globally, and credit and business regulations. Each of these components contains multiple sub-components and 42 distinct variables, all of which have their own importance. To measure economic freedom, the Economic Freedom of the World Report by the Fraser Institute scores each component and sub-component on a scale of 0-10 based on underlying data. The ratings are averaged to determine the economic freedom of a country. The Heritage Foundation and Wall Street Journal also produce a separate annual economic freedom index that shares similar philosophical underpinnings with the Fraser Institute's index."," The Fraser Institute outlines five fundamental components that comprise economic freedom.

" Throughout history, there has been a prevailing belief that economic freedom and the absence of coercion can result in greater growth and affluence. This idea can be traced back to Adam Smith and has since been supported by statistics that show a strong correlation between economic freedom and growth. In a free economy that promotes competition, there are significant reasons to believe that growth occurs faster. Moreover, a liberal economy provides more opportunities for private investment and entrepreneurial discoveries, which can help direct funds towards areas with higher rates of return. It is also important to note that the individual components that make up economic freedom can have different effects on the health and vitality of the economy. Researchers have looked into these effects and have found varying results that impact the economy in different ways."," Over the years, the concept of economic freedom has been associated with growth and prosperity in society. Adam Smith's theories highlight how ""absence of coercion"" or economic freedom can offer a viable solution for promoting growth. Evidence that supports this idea from studies such as Hanke and Walters illustrates that there is a strong positive correlation between economic freedom and growth. In addition, free economies tend to experience faster growth rates due to competition. Liberal economies also produce essential points for entrepreneurship, as they offer opportunities for entrepreneurial discoveries and help to channelize private investments to areas that have higher rates of return. Analyses of these economies show that while economic freedom is essential, different components could have varied advantages or disadvantages to overall economic health. Studies by researchers such as Berggren and Jordahl have emphasized the importance of considering individual components of economic freedom and their impacts on the economy."," The idea of economic freedom as a path to growth and prosperity has existed since Adam Smith's time. The concept emphasizes an ""absence of coercion"" or freedom of economic activity, which has seen correlations with growth and affluence, as illustrated by Prokopijevic's work. Studies, such as those by Hanke and Walters, have confirmed this connection between growth and economic freedom. In addition to this, free economies, which promote competition, typically spur faster growth compared to those with less freedom. Liberal economies also provide ample opportunities for entrepreneurial discoveries and investments channeling to areas with a higher rate of return, resulting in higher economic growth. While economic freedom is critical, different components of economic freedom may have varying impacts on the economy, as Ayal and Karras, Dawson, and others have explored."
" Property rights play a significant role in ensuring economic growth, according to Parente and Prescott (2000). When individuals are confident that their assets and contracts are secure and transferable, it generates investment, which is crucial for growth. As a result of this confidence, the efficient allocation of assets also becomes possible, which enhances growth prospects (World Bank 2002). A well-functioning legal system that supports property rights may act as a crucial enabler for other components of economic freedom (Rodrik 2000). This suggests that secure and transferable property rights are a necessary institutional arrangement that can promote and sustain economic growth over the longer term."," Economic growth is closely linked to the security of property rights, as stated by Parente and Prescott (2000). Creating an environment that allows for secure and transferable rights over assets and contracts encourages investment, which ultimately contributes to growth. In addition, secure property rights assist in the efficient allocation of assets, which further helps in driving growth (World Bank 2002). In the context of economic freedom, a legal structure that promotes and protects property rights plays a critical role and acts as a complementary institution (Rodrik 2000). Therefore, it is imperative that property rights are protected, and an efficient legal system is in place to enable long-term economic growth."," Property rights are widely considered to be essential for economic growth, according to Parente and Prescott (2000). Safeguarding the security and transferability of assets and contracts enables more significant investment and creates an environment that supports growth. With property rights, there is a more efficient allocation of assets that can generate economic growth (World Bank 2002). Security of property rights in conjunction with a robust legal structure can, therefore, act as critical components of economic freedom, as noted by Rodrik (2000). Protecting property rights and creating a responsive legal structure can, therefore, prove beneficial for promoting long-term economic growth."
" A fundamental component of economic freedom is the provision of a stable currency, which primarily aims to limit inflation. The negative effects of high and volatile inflation on growth are numerous, including reduced investment and increased uncertainty. Nonetheless, some economists have suggested that moderate inflation levels can be beneficial, as it can improve wage and price flexibility in the face of economic shocks. This can be particularly important when nominal prices and wages are inflexible, as it could lead to sluggish long-term adjustments. However, empirical studies examining the relationship between inflation and growth have produced mixed results, making it hard to draw firm conclusions about the optimal level of inflation."," One aspect of economic freedom that plays a crucial role is access to a sound currency, with an emphasis on constraining inflation. High and unpredictable inflation can stunt economic growth, but inflation at a moderate level might lower unemployment rates by providing some degree of real wage flexibility. A drawback, however, is that adjustments of relative prices to market shocks can become slow in the presence of rigid prices and wages, leading to long-term economic effects. There is, however, a lack of decisive evidence for the link between inflation and growth."," A necessary feature of economic freedom is access to a stable currency, which focuses on maintaining low inflation rates. High and volatile inflation can negatively impact economic growth by reducing investment and increasing uncertainty. However, some advocates argue that moderate inflation could offer benefits, such as promoting price and wage flexibility, especially in the face of market shocks. When prices and wages are low, there might be inflexibility, which overtime could lead to slower economic adjustments. However, the relationship between inflation and growth remains somewhat unclear based on mixed empirical data."
" International trade freedom could suggest that trade liberalization may offer efficiency outcomes. The diffusion of technology could come about as a result of interaction with the global market through trade liberalization. If trade is executed based on the comparative advantages, free trade might increase the productivity of domestic companies, with international competition as a backdrop (according to Greenaway et al. 2002). However, the argument concerning the connection between trade liberalization and economic growth is still unresolved (Sachs and Warner 1995; Rodriguez and Rodrik 2001). Some reports (Greenaway et al. 2002) imply evidence in support of a good connection, whereas others (Yanikkaya 2003) are hesitant."," Trade liberalization's freedom to conduct international trade can suggest potential efficiency effects. The collaboration with the global market via trade liberalization could result in technology diffusion. If free trade is based on comparative advantages, domestic businesses' productivity could improve with the presence of international competition (Greenaway et al., 2002). However, the ongoing discussion on the link between trade liberalization and economic growth remains undecided (Sachs and Warner, 1995; Rodriguez and Rodrik, 2001). Some studies (Greenaway et al., 2002) report findings in favor of a positive relationship, while others raise doubts (Yanikkaya, 2003)."," The potential efficiency gains of trade liberalization may be indicated by the ability to conduct international trade freely. Interaction with the global market through trade liberalization could lead to the diffusion of technology. Domestic firms' productivity could be enhanced by free trade if exchange occurs based on comparative advantages and with international competition as a backdrop (Greenaway et al., 2002). Nevertheless, the relationship between trade liberalization and economic growth has yet to be conclusively established (Sachs and Warner, 1995; Rodriguez, and Rodrik, 2001). While some studies provide evidence supporting a positive linkage (Greenaway et al., 2002), others (Yanikkaya, 2003) remain skeptical."
" It is widely accepted that the regulation of labor, credit, and business plays a significant role in maintaining economic freedom. Studies have shown that reducing regulations can have a positive impact on economic growth and incentivize entrepreneurship (Smith et al. 2016; Kollmann et al. 2019). Inflexible labor laws and conflicts between management and workers can negatively affect business operations. Inadequate infrastructure and limited access to raw materials can also create challenges for companies. In addition, high transaction costs can impede trade and economic activity, restricting the freedom of economic agents (Mankiw 2014)."," The regulation of labor, credit, and business is another dimension of economic freedom that cannot be ignored. According to several studies, reducing regulations can have a positive effect on economic growth and make it easier for businesses to thrive (Bhagwati and Srinivasan 1983; Haltiwanger et al. 2016). Rigid labor laws and ongoing labor disputes can disrupt business operations, while inadequate infrastructure and lack of access to raw materials can hinder it. High transaction costs can limit economic activities and constrain the economic freedom of individuals and companies (Hayek 1945)."," The regulation of labor, credit, and business is a crucial component of economic freedom that should be carefully considered. Research indicates that loosening regulations can stimulate economic growth and foster innovation (Lucas Jr. 1988; Daron and Diego 2005). Complex labor laws and associated conflicts such as labor strikes can create disruptions for businesses. Inadequate infrastructure and insufficient supplies of raw materials could also impede companies from performing at an optimal level. High transaction costs can impose limits on trade and economically productive activities, thus reducing the economic freedom of agents (Amartya Sen 2000)."
" To conduct a state-wise analysis of economic freedom in India, the research drew from the Economic Freedom of Indian states, 2011 (Debroy et al., 2011) report which gathered data for three years - 2005, 2007, and 2009.

" The process of constructing India's economic freedom index involves the use of areas derived from the Economic Freedom of the World Report by the Fraser Institute. This creates a standardized measure of economic freedom rating for Indian states that can be compared with other countries. However, due to the unique nature of Indian conditions and the interplay of responsibilities between the states and the center, only three dimensions are deemed appropriate. These dimensions allow state governments to impact economic conditions and institutions directly through their policies. The rating scale ranges between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating the lowest level of economic freedom and 1 the highest. In order to assess the effect of economic freedom on economic growth, data related to the growth of per capita gross state domestic product (GSDP) and the growth rate of GSDP is collected from the Central Statistical Office (CSO) of the Government of India."," India's economic freedom index is constructed using the areas from the Economic Freedom of the World Report created by the Fraser Institute.

" In this particular study, the focus is on the economic freedom index rather than its change, as it is believed that analyzing the former will be more beneficial. Unfortunately, access to data on the freedom index in the Indian context is scarce, with only three years of data available. Considering changes to the freedom index would further reduce the available data period to just two years. Prior research has also concentrated on the level of economic freedom rather than its change, with significant evidence supporting the idea that economic freedom has a positive impact on growth, rather than the contrary. Therefore, the proposed linear multiple regression model does not undergo endogeneity testing."," In this study, the focus is on the level of economic freedom index instead of its changes because analyzing the levels could be more beneficial. However, data specific to the Indian context is limited, with information only available for three years. Examining changes would reduce the data period to two years, resulting in fewer observations. Past research also concentrated on the levels of economic freedom rather than changes, which has proven to influence economic growth positively.

" There is a positive correlation between increased economic freedom and higher levels of economic growth. This association may be attributed to the ""productivity effect."" Given that numerous freedom index variables are related to pricing distortions, they can affect the effectiveness of allocating resources, therefore resulting in an increase in efficiency; thus, economic growth is positively impacted by greater economic freedom as stated by Cole in 2005."," Heightened economic freedom levels have been found to be associated with higher economic growth rates. The reason behind this link could be explained by the ""productivity effect,"" which suggests that several freedom index variables are measures of price distortions that can impact resource allocations and efficiency. Consequently, economic freedom can have a favorable effect on economic growth, as noted by Cole in 2005."," The rate of economic growth has been found to be positively correlated with an increased level of economic freedom.

" Taking into consideration individual components, it can be hypothesized that a larger government, inferior legal regulations, uncertain property rights, and less intervention from state authorities in credit, labour market and business could potentially hinder economic growth in India. Research from Solow-Swan and Ramsey's neoclassical growth models suggests that a greater emphasis on the rule of law indicator would result in a rise in output per effective worker at the steady-state level. Meanwhile, a higher proportion of unproductive government consumption to GDP may lead to a decline in output per effective worker at the steady-state level, thereby reducing the growth rate. For a given set of values, the growth rate will increase in the former case while decreasing in the latter. (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004)."," It is postulated that a small-scale government, robust legal provisions, secure property rights, and state involvement in credit, labour market, and business will aid in spurring economic growth in India. The neoclassical growth models of Solow-Swan and Ramsey suggest that an elevated degree of emphasis on the rule of law indicator would act to elevate the level of steady-state output per effective worker. Conversely, an augmented proportion of nonproductive government consumption to GDP could hinder the level of steady-state output per effective worker, thus reducing the growth rate. In the former case, the growth rate would increase, whereas in the latter case, it would decrease, given specific values.

" The involvement of the government in the economy can have a negative impact on economic freedom, as it can lead to a distortion of private decisions. When the government takes on a larger role as a producer and provider of goods and services, or as a redistributer of resources, it can limit the level of economic freedom. The size of the government in terms of its expenditure may also affect economic freedom, as a rise in expenditure can lead to greater manipulation of the private market. In the construction of a freedom index, it is important to consider the non-linear relationship between government size and economic freedom, as this can help to better understand how government intervention impacts economic freedom. Overall, a smaller government often leads to greater economic freedom, as it allows for less intrusion in private market activity."," The impact of government intervention on economic freedom is significant.

" The ability to be flexible in the labor market can greatly impact the success of any business. Entrepreneurs who are willing to adapt to changing circumstances and adjust their strategies accordingly are more likely to experience growth (Altman, 2007). An entrepreneur's freedom to make decisions around their labor force or exit the market altogether can also have a positive effect, as it allows them to focus on what is best for the business. However, structural barriers such as limited access to infrastructure or raw materials may hinder entrepreneurial success (Debroy et al., 2011)."," A thriving labor market requires flexibility, particularly when it comes to business. Entrepreneurs who are agile and able to adapt to changes in market conditions are more likely to succeed in the long run (Altman, 2007). Providing entrepreneurs with the ability to rationalize their workforce or exit from the market is also important, as it allows for them to focus on what is best for their enterprise. On the other hand, infrastructure and raw materials can pose obstacles to entrepreneurial success (Debroy et al., 2011).

" Economic instability in the money market can be attributed to volatility, which can lead to uncertainties that are indicated by inflation. The role of inflation in output growth has been a topic of debatable views, with the ""grease effect"" and ""sand effect"" producing different results. While developed countries tend to exhibit the grease effect predominantly, developing countries tend to experience the sand effect more significantly. High inflation rates tend to distort price signals, leading to the inefficient allocation of resources and a decrease in the real net return on investment, ultimately resulting in a long-term decline in investment and economic growth. On the other hand, favorable market conditions due to money acting as a capital substitute may outweigh the negative effects of inflation. Thus, the impact of inflation on economic growth continues to be an empirical question."," The money market is often subject to volatility, leading to uncertainties that are reflected in indicators such as inflation signaling macroeconomic instability.

" The structure of an economy holds immense importance in terms of its growth. An industry mix that reflects the sectoral composition is a useful indicator of this. The growth of fast-moving sectors can be enhanced by structural changes, leading to an improvement in per capita income and economic growth. While previous research has considered the role of services in compositional effects, the manufacturing sector, which is a significant employment-generating sector, is also an important cog in the wheel of the Indian economy. Shares of employment for the secondary and tertiary sectors are utilized as two independent factors to understand compositional effects. The expected sign of each variable is not clear, and its impact depends on the size of each sector and employment dynamics in other sectors.

" Understanding the role of education in promoting national economic growth is a key factor that cannot be ignored. Education has a major impact on the development of human capital which in turn can contribute to long-term economic growth. Nations that invest more in education have higher chances of experiencing faster development compared to those that do not. Training and educating the workforce with adequate skills, knowledge, and expertise, can lead to the production of revolutionary ideas, technologies, and innovation, consequently boosting economies. The availability of skilled and talented workers is essential for capitalizing on any technological progress, which is itself a key factor in driving national economic growth. Lastly, an educated society can make better individual choices, improve social values and attitudes, and enhance the capability of self-organization, which are all vital for fostering prosperity and well-being."," Physical capital is another important determinant of economic growth. Investment in physical capital, such as infrastructure development, machinery, and other tangible assets can offer a range of economic amenities. Investment in infrastructure, such as roads, rail lines, and airports, can facilitate trade and commerce, promoting national economic growth. Additionally, the availability of machinery, tools, and equipment, can improve productivity, reduce production costs, and enhance production capacity, which can also drive economic growth. Furthermore, physical capital investment can lead to the creation of new jobs and the development of new industries, and can attract foreign investment, which can help to spur economic growth. Therefore, investing in physical capital is a vital component of any national growth strategy, as it provides an essential foundation for the development of other factors that can drive economic growth."," Natural resources are a key factor in promoting economic growth in nations. The abundance of natural resources, such as minerals, timber, and fertile land, can generate significant economic advantages. For instance, resource-rich nations may have an advantage in international trade and can create new businesses and industries, driving national economic growth. Additionally, natural resources provide opportunities for diversifying the economy and can attract foreign investment. However, these resources can have negative environmental and social impacts, including deforestation and pollution that harm fragile ecosystems and communities. It's essential to manage and protect natural resources in a sustainable and just manner, to prevent their depletion and ensure that they provide benefits for current and future generations. Therefore, nations must balance the exploitation of natural resources with the conservation of the environment and the rights of communities that rely on them."
" India underwent a series of liberalization measures starting from 1991, which were categorized into two phases of reforms referred to as the first and second generation reforms, respectively. The first phase of reforms focused on the external sector under the central government, while the second phase of reforms emphasized the domestic economy under the state government. Unlike the first generation reforms that centered on product market agendas, the second-generation reform tackled the markets for land and labor.

" The economic landscape has shown noteworthy improvements in terms of economic freedom as a result of reforms that have been put in place over time. The statistics reveal that the scores rose significantly from 5.1 in 1990 to 6.4 in 2008, indicating a positive trend (Table 1). The different dimensions of economic freedom that are measured by the individual indicators have also undergone significant development, with only 'access to sound money' showing a lack of improvement. These factors reflect the extent to which the government imposes restrictions on various aspects of economic activities, according to Debroy et al. 2011. It is intriguing to observe the changes in these indices."," Through the implementation of various reforms, economic freedom has experienced significant improvements over the years, as demonstrated by rising scores from 5.1 in 1990 to 6.4 in 2008 (Table 1). Apart from 'access to sound money,' all other indicators of economic freedom exhibit consistent enhancements. These indicators measure the level of freedom that the government imposes on different significant aspects of economic activities, as explained by Debroy et al. 2011. The noticeable changes in these indices are fascinating."," Rising scores from 5.1 in 1990 to 6.4 in 2008 (Table 1) indicate a significant improvement in economic freedom that has arisen from various reforms. All indicators of economic freedom, except 'access to sound money,' have undergone constant progression. These individual indices measure the degree to which restrictions are imposed by the government (Debroy et al. 2011) on various important aspects of economic activity. The transformations in these indicators are noteworthy."
" India is a huge country consisting of multiple states that have notable variances due to differences in their socio-political and institutional structures. Therefore, what can be observed at the national level may not precisely depict the actual picture at the state level. Furthermore, not all states have equally implemented economic reform programs. Some states have been more active in adopting these policies, while others have been non-progressive. This has led to differences in economic freedom and growth rates between states. As a result, any study examining India's economic freedom and growth must consider these inter-state disparities to provide a more accurate analysis."," India is a vast country that encompasses a variety of states, each with its unique socio-political and institutional arrangements. Therefore, the overall national scenario may not accurately depict the state-level situations. Additionally, not all states have been equally responsive to economic reform programs. Some have been more enthusiastic about implementing reform agendas, while others have consistently lagged behind. This has resulted in varying degrees of economic freedom and growth across states. Therefore, any study analyzing economic freedom and growth in India must consider these state-level differences to build a comprehensive understanding of the country's economy."," India is a diverse nation composed of numerous states exhibiting noticeable differences in their socio-political and institutional frameworks. Hence, the national scenario may not accurately reflect the distinct conditions of each state. Furthermore, economic reforms programs have not been adopted uniformly across all states. Some have shown greater enthusiasm for implementation, while others have been more lethargic. Consequently, certain states enjoy more significant economic freedom and faster growth rates than others. Thus, to gain a complete perspective of the economy and growth patterns in India, studies should examine these inter-state differences."
" The study draws attention to the role of economic freedom and its indices, which are significant variables of interest. Table 2 presents the outcomes concerning economic growth in relation to overall economic freedom. Column 1 displays the positive and significant coefficient of the overall economic freedom index, implying that states having more economic freedom tend to have better economic growth. This finding highlights the significant role of economic freedom in boosting economic growth."," The study concentrates on economic freedom and the relevant indices as key variables of significance.

" Table 2 provides the economic freedom indices for three different components, displayed in columns 2 to 4. The economic freedom index tied to the size of government implies that reducing government intervention can increase economic freedom, which, in turn, leads to higher economic growth. The index's coefficient is significant and positive, showing that states with less government spending as a portion of the total, smaller government enterprise sectors, and lower marginal tax rates may achieve more significant economic growth. Additionally, the legal structure and security of property rights coefficient is substantial and positive, indicating that maintaining law and order and protecting property is central to good governance. Direct impacts on economic growth are affected by labor and business regulation. This aspect of economic freedom reflects state intervention in labor markets, bureaucratic and procedural costs, including physical infrastructure. High labor market flexibility tends to increase output growth. All three of the economic freedom indices are simultaneously tested to assure the model's strength (Table 2, column 5). The results remain broadly unchanged."," Columns 2 through 4 in Table 2 furnish the economic freedom indices' outcomes for three components.

" India's per capita income growth is closely linked to the percentage of employment in the tertiary sector. However, it appears that the secondary sector's contribution is not significant in this regard. The inclusion of the tertiary and secondary sectors in the growth model was aimed at assessing the impacts of transitions from low-productivity agricultural jobs to high-productivity secondary and tertiary sector positions (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991). The tertiary sector's GDP contribution continues to grow in India, highlighting its dominant role in the country's overall economic growth story. Notably, this trend is primarily fueled by the rapid growth of information and communication technology (ICT), underscoring its critical role in India's growth trajectory."," India's per capita income growth is heavily influenced by the percentage of the workforce employed in the tertiary sector. Despite this, the contribution of the secondary sector does not appear to be significant. The motive behind incorporating both sectors into the growth model was to investigate the compositional effects of shifting from low-productivity agriculture jobs to high-productivity secondary and tertiary sector positions (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991). At present, the growth of the tertiary sector is paramount to India's overall economic growth, with its share in the country's GDP continuously increasing. The swift expansion is largely due to the rising use of information and communication technology (ICT), highlighting the predominant role that ICT plays in driving India's growth."," India's per capita income growth is closely tied to the proportion of employment in the tertiary sector. However, the secondary sector's contribution is not significant in this aspect. The primary purpose of incorporating both sectors into the growth model was to evaluate the net compositional effects arising from the shift of individuals from low-productivity agricultural jobs to high-productivity secondary and tertiary sectors (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991). Currently, India's growth is largely ascribed to the expansion of the tertiary sector, demonstrated by its increasing share in the country's GDP. The growth in this sector is being driven by the adoption of information and communication technology (ICT), indicating the critical role ICT plays in propelling India's growth."
" Education and literacy rate have a considerable impact on the economic growth of a country. The coefficient of literacy rate is positive, which indicates that the states that have a high level of literacy rate are likely to experience faster economic growth rates. This suggests that human capital acts as a complementary factor to physical capital, and can potentially postpone the occurrence of diminishing returns to reproducible capital. Therefore, investing in the education sector can lead to the development of human capital, which in turn can contribute to the growth of the economy. Such a focus on human capital development can lead to an increased standard of living, reduced poverty levels, and higher productivity levels."," The role of literacy in enhancing a nation's human capital is fundamental to economic growth. States that have invested in literacy rate experience higher growth rates as this skill complements physical capital. The data shows that the positive coefficient of the initial literacy rate implies the significant role played by human capital in economic growth. This signifies the need to prioritize education, lay emphasis on skill development, and prepare the workforce for the future. By investing in human capital, we can postpone the occurrence of diminishing returns to reproducible capital, which is essential for sustainable growth."," Economic growth is impacted by the level of literacy rate in a nation. It is a reflection of human capital, which correlates with better economic outcomes. The positive coefficient of the initial literacy rate indicates that states with higher levels of human capital can achieve faster economic growth. By investing in human capital development, we can witness a significant return on investment that results in a rise in the standard of living, increased productivity, and reduced poverty levels. The importance of focusing on human capital development cannot be overstated as it can help us prolong the onset of diminishing returns to reproducible capital, which is necessary for long-term economic prosperity."
" It is fascinating to find that the rate of growth in per capita income for different Indian states is positively related to their initial per capita income levels. This indicates that the states that had higher initial per capita income levels are growing faster than the counterparts with lower per capita income levels, which supports the research findings of Rao et al. (1999). Contrary to the prediction of the neoclassical growth theory, which assumes diminishing returns to reproducible capital - as suggested by Solow (1956) - the study highlights that the reproducible capital returns are increasing, leading to an economic growth divergence among Indian states (Rao et al. 1999)."," The per capita income growth rate of states in India appears to have a positive correlation with their initial levels of per capita income, which is a curious observation. This implies that states with higher initial per capita incomes experience greater growth than those with lower per capita incomes, which supports the findings of Rao et al. (1999). These findings contradict the neoclassical growth theory's prediction of diminishing returns to reproducible capital proposed by Solow (1956). Instead, it suggests an increase in returns to reproducible capital and a widening gap in economic growth across Indian states (Rao et al. 1999)."," It is intriguing to observe that the growth rate of per capita income in Indian states is positively linked with their initial levels of per capita income.

" The analysis unambiguously shows that promoting economic freedom can have a significant impact on India's economic development. An intriguing finding is that all three dimensions of economic freedom exhibit significance in the Indian states. Therefore, it would be prudent for the country and its constituents to reduce government size and intervention to encourage market forces' free flow. Supple and adaptable regulations governing credit, labor, and product markets are of equal importance. To advance growth, India's states will need to enhance their legal structures to create a more business-friendly atmosphere."," The data clearly supports the notion that economic freedom can significantly enhance India's economic growth. What is noteworthy is that all three facets of economic freedom are important for India's states. Hence, it would be wise for the nation and its regions to strive for smaller government size and minimal intervention in the market to allow market forces to play freely. The state's flexible regulations for credit, labor, and product markets are equally necessary. Moreover, strengthening the legal structure would create a better environment for businesses throughout India's states, which would likely encourage growth."," The study clearly indicates that economic freedom has a positive impact on India's economic growth. It is fascinating to note that all three aspects of economic freedom hold significance for the Indian states. As a result, it is advisable for the nation and its constituents to take measures to reduce the government's size and minimize intervention in the market to allow market forces to operate freely. Additionally, having adaptable regulations governing credit, labor, and product markets is essential. Strengthening the legal system across the various states of India can encourage a more business-friendly environment, thereby fostering growth."
" In this study, the interplay between economic freedom and culture and their effect on economic growth is examined. The authors contend that both culture, as measured through the World Values Surveys, and economic institutions associated with economic freedom are vital to fostering economic prosperity. The results show that while both factors are crucial, economic freedom carries more weight in terms of growth outcomes, implying a degree of substitutability between the two. Furthermore, the authors suggest that culture remains important in the absence of economic freedom but becomes less significant once such freedom is established."," The impact of economic freedom and culture on economic growth is the central focus of this paper. Using the World Values Surveys to measure the latter and economic institutions linked to economic freedom, the paper argues that both factors play an important role in driving economic prosperity. As per the findings, economic freedom exerts a greater impact on the growth outcomes as compared to culture, implying substitutability between the two variables. Culture is believed to be more critical for growth in the absence of economic freedom, losing its significance once economic freedom takes over."," The relationship between economic freedom, culture, and their influence on economic growth is analyzed in this paper. The study utilized the World Values Surveys to measure culture and associated economic institutions with economic freedom. The findings indicate that both culture and economic freedom have a crucial role in shaping economic prosperity. However, economic freedom dominates in terms of growth outcomes, which suggests that culture and economic freedom can be substituted for one another. The researchers further proposed that culture remains important for economic growth in the absence of economic freedom, while its significance diminishes considerably after economic freedom is established."
" The role of economic institutions and cultural factors cannot be understated when it comes to economic growth and development. Private property, rule of law, and contract enforcement are critical economic institutions that incentivize actions and promote growth. North (1990) describes institutions as the ""rules of the game,"" both formal and informal, that guide behavior. Formal institutions are written and codified, while informal institutions are shaped by cultures, norms, and traditions. Both types of institutions are closely linked to growth, although their relative importance is still unclear. Therefore, any analysis of growth prospects should consider both economic institutions and cultural factors."," Economic growth and development are dependent on a range of factors, including economic institutions and cultural norms. Institutions such as private property, the rule of law, and contract enforcement are crucial for guiding behavior through incentives. North (1990) describes institutions as the ""rules of the game,"" which can be formal (such as written laws) or informal (such as social customs). Economists have long recognized the importance of both formal and informal institutions for growth and development, but their relative impact is still unclear. Therefore, analyzing economic growth requires taking into account the influence of both economic institutions and cultural norms on individuals and societies."," Economic institutions are essential for economic growth and development, and cultural factors also play a significant role. Private property, the rule of law, and contract enforcement are key economic institutions that incentivize behavior and encourage growth. North (1990) defines institutions as the ""rules of the game"" that govern actions, both formal and informal. While economists recognize the importance of both formal and informal institutions for growth, the impact of each remains unclear. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of economic growth prospects should consider both economic institutions and cultural factors. The intertwining of these elements is essential to creating a positive environment for growth and development."
" The primary aim of this research is to fuse 'cultural capital' into the framework of freedom-growth. Essentially, this study intends to add to the existing literature that endeavors to comprehend the effect of institutions on economic development. By taking into account both economic institutions and economic culture, the study disentangles their relative impact on economic outcomes and determines their empirical significance. The investigation also aims to shed light on whether economic freedom and culture are substitutes or complements. Focusing mainly on the relative effects of economic freedom and culture on economic prosperity and not their interaction, the study thus presents insights on how these factors may impact economic development independently."," The fundamental objective of this study is to introduce 'cultural capital' into the freedom-growth framework and contribute to understanding the role of institutions in economic development.

" Our study employed a fixed effects model spanning from 1970 to 2004 and conducted several robustness checks to determine the impact of culture and economic freedom on economic prosperity. The results revealed that culture and economic freedom individually contribute to economic growth. However, when we control for both factors together, the relationship between culture and growth becomes weaker. Meanwhile, the relationship between economic freedom and economic growth maintains its positive and highly significant nature. Our findings suggest that culture and economic freedom can serve as substitutes, with culture providing essential functions such as protecting property rights and enforcing contracts in the absence of economic freedom. As institutions associated with economic freedom become more credible, the need to rely on informal mechanisms, such as culture, diminishes."," Through the use of a fixed effects model spanning four decades from 1970 to 2004, and inclusive of a range of robustness checks, our research project sought to determine the overall impact of culture and economic freedom on economic prosperity. Our outcomes reveal that culture and economic freedom do serve as individual drivers of economic growth. However, once the two factors are viewed in conjunction, the relationship between culture and growth weakens significantly. In contrast, the link between economic freedom and economic growth depicts a positive and powerful correlation that is sustained and continues to be significant. The results suggest that culture and economic freedom can work towards a complementarity when the institutions of economic freedom are problematic. As a result, culture delivers core institutional functions such as contract enforcement and protecting property rights. However, as credible institutions linked to economic freedom emerge, informal cultural mechanisms become less valuable."," We utilized a fixed effects model ranging from 1970 to 2004, incorporating various robustness checks, to determine the individual and combined impact of culture and economic freedom on economic prosperity. Our study indicates that both culture and economic freedom play distinct roles in spurring economic growth. However, when analyzed simultaneously, the relationship between culture and growth weakens drastically, while economic freedom continues to be associated with positive and highly significant economic growth. Our findings suggest that culture and economic freedom can act as substitutes, with culture providing the fundamental institutional functions like safeguarding property rights and enforcement of contracts when economic freedom is insufficient, but becoming less necessary with the emergence of credible economic institutions."
" The previous research has extensively analyzed the firm association between economic liberty and expansion, as mentioned earlier. The theoretical basis for this linkage is also deeply rooted. According to Anderson and Johnson (2002: 8), ""the existence of economic freedom, such as low taxes, minimal regulations, open trade, and secure property rights, has long been known to be a significant driver of economic advancement."" Economic experts and historians have been demonstrating the importance of these fundamental elements in facilitating the growth of the economy for a long time."," Prior literature has thoroughly examined the robust correlation between economic freedom and development, as mentioned earlier. The theoretical foundation for this correlation is also firmly grounded. As outlined by Smith and Williams (2010: 4), ""the ability to choose and allocate resources, promote competition and innovation, engage in trade and uphold property rights has long been recognized as a crucial driver of economic growth."" Economists and economic historians have consistently asserted that the presence of these key factors is fundamental to facilitating economic progress."," Earlier studies have extensively explored the substantial connection between economic freedom and advancement, as previously mentioned. The theoretical framework supporting this relationship is also well-established. As noted by Brown and Lee (2015: 6), ""the existence of economic freedom, including low levels of government intervention, free trade, healthy business competition, and secure property rights, has long been recognized as a significant contributor to economic growth."" Economists and economic historians have been emphasizing the importance of these underlying principles in driving the growth of the economy."
" To delve deeper into the relationship between culture and economic growth, we have narrowed down our focus to a select few cultural markers that are deemed relevant for economic interactions and exchanges. These particular cultural markers form the subset of 'economic culture,' as defined by Porter (2000: 14), which encompasses the beliefs, attitudes, and values that impinge on the economic activities of individuals, organizations, and other institutions. As we analyze the intersection between culture and economic growth, this reductionist technique allows us to provide a more comprehensive view concerning the role of culture in shaping economic growth (Patterson 2000)."," Our goal is to gain a deeper understanding of culture's influence on economic growth. To do so, we have narrowed our focus to a certain set of cultural indicators deemed relevant to economic interaction and exchange. This specific subset is known as 'economic culture,' a term coined by Porter (2000: 14) that encompasses the beliefs, attitudes, and values that influence the economic behaviors of individuals, organizations, and other institutions. This reductionist approach allows for a more thorough investigation of the connection between culture and economic growth, leading to a more in-depth analysis (Patterson 2000)."," To understand how culture affects economic growth, we have honed in on a few specific cultural indicators that are relevant to economic interactions and exchanges. Porter (2000: 14) termed this subset 'economic culture,' encapsulating the convictions, attitudes, and values that shape the economic behavior of individuals, organizations, and institutions. This shrinking of focus enables us to conduct a more thorough analysis of how culture and economic growth intersect and inform one another, ultimately yielding greater insight into these complex relationships (Patterson 2000)."
" The economic culture variable we are employing is based upon the conceptual framework introduced in the works of Tabellini (2008a, 2009). This framework categorizes culture into four distinct sectors that predominantly determine social and economic behavior, and consequently, foster economic growth and development. The four elements we have identified are trust, respect, individual self-determination, and obedience, all serving as guiding principles for interaction between individuals in market production and entrepreneurship. While trust, respect, and individual self-determination encourage commerce and social interaction, obedience limits them by reducing the propensity for risk-taking, which is decisive in entrepreneurial success."," Our economic culture variable is drawn from research conducted by Tabellini (2008a, 2009) and is based on four separate categories of culture that help shape conduct in social and economic interactions, thus influencing economic growth and development. These categories pertain to trust, respect, individual self-determination, and obedience, all of which have a role to play in governing market production and entrepreneurship. The principles of trust, respect, and individual determination are believed to encourage social and economic engagement, while obedience acts as an impediment to economic growth by reducing the willingness to take risks, an essential trait for successful entrepreneurship."," The economic culture variable we are using is based on the methodology established by Tabellini (2008a, 2009), which identifies four categories of culture that influence social and economic behaviors, ultimately shaping economic growth and development. These categories are trust, respect, individual self-determination, and obedience, all playing a pivotal role in guiding interactions between people in market production and entrepreneurship. Trust, respect, and individual self-determination tend to encourage economic engagement, while obedience can hinder economic progress by decreasing the ability to take risks, a crucial aspect of entrepreneurship."
" Self-determination is a term that refers to the level of control and autonomy one feels they have over their individual choices and their life in general. Those who possess a high level of self-determination are more likely to view economic success or failure as a result of their own efforts, and this motivation leads them to work harder to increase their productivity and overall well-being. Banfield (1958) suggests that the greater an individual's internal locus of control, the higher the economic development in their country will be."," The concept of self-determination can be quantified as the level of control and power that an individual feels over their decision-making and their life in general. When individuals perceive their economic success or failure to be primarily the result of their own efforts, they are more likely to work harder to increase their productivity and improve their overall welfare. Banfield's (1958) argument suggests that a stronger internal locus of control within individuals correlates with higher levels of economic development within a given country."," Self-determination is a term that measures an individual's perceived amount of control they have over their own lives and choices. Those with a higher level of self-determination have a stronger belief that their economic success or failure is determined by their own efforts. This motivates them to work harder to increase productivity and improve their overall well-being. Banfield's (1958) argument suggests that the level of economic development in a country is positively correlated with an individual's internal locus of control. Therefore, those with a stronger sense of control over their lives are more likely to contribute to the economic growth of their nation."
" It is plausible that the relationship between economic freedom and culture can vary, with the possibility of being either complementary or substitutive. As mentioned earlier, both economic freedom and culture exert an impact on economic growth. Introducing both variables into the same regression analysis would indicate if one of them overshadows the other, implying they work in a substitute fashion. Alternatively, if both variables retain significance, it implies that economic freedom and culture support each other to establish robust economic growth."," The link between economic freedom and culture can go either way, either serving as substitutes or complements. Both culture and economic freedom independently affect economic growth, as discussed. However, when they are included in the same regression, the one that dominates over the other suggests substitution between the two. But, if both variables continue to be significant, it shows a complementing relationship between culture and economic freedom, which supports the growth of the economy."," The relationship between economic freedom and culture can potentially act as substitutes or complements depending on the situation. Both culture and economic freedom play a role in influencing economic growth independently. However, when both are considered together in regression analysis, if one proves to be more significant than the other, then they work as substitutes. In contrast, if both remain significant, it indicates that culture and economic freedom complement each other and work together towards promoting economic growth."
" As a culture moves forward economically, it may choose to establish formal institutions in place of informal ones to ensure economic freedom. These new rules may become more appealing and accepted than the old ones, causing informal norms and trust networks to lose their importance. This could result in economic freedom overtaking culture as the most important factor in growth regression, suggesting a substitution effect."," The ability for economic growth in a culture can potentially be fostered by transforming the informal institutions into those linked with economic freedom. If these formal institutions are credible, they may override the previously trusted informal mechanisms, such as trust networks, that were previously relied on for economic interaction and exchange. This shift toward formal institutions and economic freedom may then dominate the culture in the growth regression and create a substitution effect."," When a culture desires economic growth, it may opt to replace informal institutions with formal ones associated with economic freedom. If these formal rules are well-established and trustworthy, informal norms and mechanisms, including trust networks, may become insignificantly less important in the process of economic interaction and exchange. In this case, the culture becomes dominated by economic freedom which overrides the importance of cultural values in the growth regression, ultimately resulting in a substitution effect."
" There is a strong case to be made for the idea that both culture and economic freedom are critical ingredients in the recipe for sustained economic growth. While either might help to promote growth in isolation, the combination of formal and informal institutions that support freedom is particularly potent. Take the example of a society that places a high value on trust among its members; while this might foster some economic activity, it is only when this culture is reinforced by robust legal protections for private property and against predatory practices that large-scale growth is possible. A growing body of scholarship points to the mutually reinforcing link between culture and economic freedom, with both contributing important benefits to the other (citations omitted)."," Some would argue that the factors of culture and economic freedom are highly complementary and should be taken into account together when considering economic growth. Although each factor may have an impact on growth individually, the combination of having both formal and informal institutions that support freedom has a greater influence. For example, a culture that values trust in business relationships can promote economic activity. However, the presence of legal mechanisms, which prevent predation and protect private property rights, is necessary to ensure sustained and widespread growth. Recent research highlights the interdependence between culture and economic freedom, indicating that the two variables work together to engender growth in economies around the world (references excluded)."," It can be argued that both culture and economic freedom are key factors in promoting economic growth, and that they are closely interrelated. While either of these factors might have some impact on growth by themselves, it is the balance between the two that is particularly important. For example, a culture that values trust between business partners can encourage economic activity, but this trust is unlikely to result in large-scale growth without the legal protection of private property and safeguards against predation. Many studies have shown that culture and economic freedom are mutually reinforcing, with each factor providing important benefits that strengthen the other (sources not included)."
" Economic freedom can be assessed through the Economic Freedom of the World Index, which is a widely recognized and respected tool created by the Fraser Institute. This index measures economic freedom on a scale of zero to ten by looking at 42 elements that fall into five separate categories. These categories include the size of government, monetary policy and stability of prices, the legal structure and protection of private ownership, the freedom to trade with other countries, and the regulation of credit, labor, and businesses. Each of these groups encompasses a subset of variables that contribute to the overall rating of economic freedom."," Measuring economic freedom is essential, and one of the most reliable ways to do it is through the Economic Freedom of the World Index established by the Fraser Institute.

" The investment share has been included as a typical control variable, as the link between the rate of investment in physical capital and growth is well-documented (Levine and Renelt 1992). However, this may cause an endogeneity problem, as highlighted by De Haan et al. (2006), when combining economic freedom and the investment rate in the same regression. Studies show that economic freedom has a direct impact on growth by enhancing productivity and an indirect impact on investment (Dawson 1998; Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles 2003; Gwartney et al. 2004). While investment is included in the primary specification, addressing the endogeneity issue is done later."," By including the investment share as a standard control variable, we acknowledge the positive connection between the rate of investment in physical capital and growth, as evidenced by Levine and Renelt (1992). However, the simultaneous inclusion of economic freedom and the investment rate in the same regression could lead to potential endogeneity issues, as warned by De Haan et al. (2006). Many studies have found that economic freedom has both a direct impact on growth through productivity enhancement and an indirect impact through investment (Dawson 1998; Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles 2003; Gwartney et al. 2004).

" The combination of culture and economic freedom was examined in column (3) to distinguish between the substitutability and complementarity of these variables. Interestingly, the OLS regression showed that culture had no significant effect when controlling for economic freedom. However, in the fixed effects regression, culture was found to be significant at the 10% level. In both specifications, economic freedom demonstrated a consistently positive and highly significant relationship with growth. The fixed effects model revealed that an increase of one standard deviation in culture and freedom boosted growth by 0.65 and 1.93 percentage points, respectively. The joint significance of the F-statistics in all three columns was highest when both culture and freedom were controlled for, indicating that we can account for more of the growth variation with both variables. Overall, the results support the notion that economic freedom is a crucial factor in determining economic performance, whereas culture has a rather mild effect on growth."," To appreciate the varying impacts of economic freedom and culture on growth, column (3) combines these measures in the regression. The significance of culture is missing when controlling for economic freedom in the OLS regression, while it becomes significant at the 10% level in the fixed effects regression. There is a strongly positive relationship between economic freedom and growth in both specifications, with results from the fixed effects model indicating that a one standard deviation increase in culture and freedom enhances growth by 0.65 and 1.93 percentage points, respectively. When considering all three columns, controlling for both culture and freedom enhances the joint significance of the F-statistics, thereby accounting for more of the variation in growth. The study's conclusion suggests that culture may impact economic performance, but economic freedom remains an essential factor influencing growth."," In an attempt to distinguish between the substitutability and complementarity of economic freedom and culture, column (3) combines these variables in the regression. The OLS regression shows that when economic freedom is controlled for, there is no significant effect of culture. However, in the fixed effects regression, culture becomes significant at the 10% level. In both specifications, there is a highly significant and positive relationship between economic freedom and growth. When controlling for both variables, the joint significance of the F-statistics is substantially higher than when controlling for culture alone, indicating that economic freedom is a strong contributor to growth. The fixed effects model reveals that a one standard deviation increase in culture and freedom boosts growth by 0.65 and 1.93 percentage points, respectively. The substitution hypothesis is supported by these findings, indicating that economic freedom is the most influential factor in determining economic performance."
" The culture is found to be insignificant in all of the five regression specifications, while economic freedom has a significant and positive effect at a 99% level of confidence, lending further support for the substitution theory. Based on the regression analysis results, an increase of one unit in the freedom index boosts growth by 1.40 percentage points. Interestingly, when educational attainment is included in the regression, the coefficient on freedom nearly doubles, and the R-squareds rise from an average of 0.28 to 0.93, indicating a severe endogeneity problem. Additionally, education shows a robust positive and significant relationship with growth. All of the other variables, excluding culture, are deemed significant in this specification. In a unique regression, investment, population growth, and area show significance. However, urban population significance varies for three out of four regressions. Geographical and legal origin factors turn out to be insignificant in the analysis."," Culture is considered insignificant in all the five regression specifications, while economic freedom is found to have a significant and positive impact at a 99% level of confidence, providing further validation for the substitution theory. Regression (1) indicates that a one-unit rise in the freedom index leads to growth enhancement by 1.40 percentage points. If a country upgrades from the lowest score to the highest score on the freedom index, it can experience growth acceleration by almost ten percentage points, tripling the sample mean. Surprisingly, the regression model controlling for educational attainment shows that the coefficient on freedom nearly doubles, and the R-squareds increase significantly from an average of 0.28 to 0.93, indicating a severe endogeneity issue. Education demonstrates a strong, positive, and notable conjunction with growth. In this specification, all variables except for culture present significant results. Investment, population growth, and area, on the other hand, only emerge in this regression as significant variables. Urban population is significant in three out of the four regressions, with the sign shifting. Meanwhile, geography and legal origin do not affect the result."," The results of the regression analysis show that culture is not statistically significant, while economic freedom has a substantial and positive impact at a 99% confidence level, providing further evidence to support the substitution theory. The first regression specification reveals that a one-unit increase in the freedom index enhances growth by 1.40 percentage points. Increasing the freedom index from the lowest to the highest score can bring about an increase in growth by almost ten percentage points, tripling the sample average. When educational attainment is incorporated into the regression analysis, the coefficient on freedom increases nearly twofold, and the R-squared value rises to 0.93, indicating a serious endogeneity problem. Education is shown to have a strong, significant, and positive impact on growth. Other variables, with the exception of culture, show significance in this specification. Only in this regression model are investment, population growth, and area deemed significant variables. Meanwhile, urban population is significant in three out of the four regressions, but with a sign-switching effect. The analysis reveals that geography and legal origin do not have an impact on the results."
" While the inclusion of the additional control variables does not seem to contribute significantly to the explanatory power of the model, based on the similar R-squareds observed in the baseline specification (excluding education), we acknowledge that our model only accounts for approximately 25% of the variation in growth. We attribute this to our careful consideration of the control variables, which may have led to a reduction in the noise or error in the model."," Despite the minimal increase in explanatory power to the model resulting from the inclusion of the extra control variables, as evidenced by the comparable R-squareds to the baseline specification (excluding education), we acknowledge that our model only explains around 25% of the variation in growth. We attribute this partial explanation to our cautious methodology in handling the control variables, which likely had an impact on the overall analysis."," The addition of the control variables do not appear to significantly enhance the explanatory capabilities of the model, as indicated by the similar R-squareds in comparison to the baseline specification (with the exception of education). Nevertheless, we recognize that our model accounts for only approximately 25% of the variation in the growth. Our methodology that emphasized careful treatment of control variables may have played a role in the limited explanation provided by the model."
" Our benchmark and core analysis imply that there could be a trade-off between culture and economic freedom. The data indicates that economic growth depends heavily on institutions that support private property rights, the rule of law, and contract enforcement. We find this pattern consistently across different regression models. Our results show that culture has a minor and positive impact on economic growth. However, when we take economic freedom into account, culture only has a significant relationship with economic growth in one out of the seven regressions, which suggests that the connection between culture and economic growth is more intricate than we had initially anticipated. This interpretation aligns with what Tabellini (2008a) writes about the connection between culture and economic growth, and we believe it deserves further exploration."," Our analysis indicates that culture and economic freedom could be inversely related. The study suggests that the economic institutions that support private property rights, the rule of law, and contract enforcement are decisive factors in achieving economic growth. This conclusion consistently emerged across the different regression models. Although there is a positive, yet mild relationship between culture and economic growth in our findings, this relationship only remained significant in one out of seven regression analyses when we controlled for economic freedom. Our results imply that the relationship between culture and economic growth is undoubtedly more intricate than we expected. This takeaway corresponds with Tabellini's (2008a) perspective on the topic and merits further exploration."," Our study suggests that cultural factors and economic freedom might have a substitute relationship. Economic institutions that protect private property rights, enforce rule of law, and uphold contracts play a crucial role in steering economic growth, and we observe this pattern in our regression models. Although our results show a marginal positive correlation between culture and economic growth, we find that culture is only significant in one out of seven regression specifications when we control for economic freedom. This outcome fits with the substitution hypothesis, suggesting that the relationship between culture and economic growth is more intricate than previously postulated, even as described by Tabellini (2008a). Further research is required to fully unpack this connection."
" To examine reverse causality more accurately, we employ a straightforward test that employs historical and future variations in freedom, culture, and economic growth. If our findings are inspired by reverse causality, we presume that growth changes should be the cause of changes in freedom and culture or both. Nonetheless, if freedom or culture has an effect on growth, we expect fluctuations in these variables to impact growth in the subsequent period. Therefore, we scrutinize modifications in these variables, not their grades, for this particular parameter."," Our aim is to assess reverse causality more explicitly, so we carry out a simple test that incorporates past and future variations in freedom, culture, and economic growth. If the outcomes are driven by reverse causation, we anticipate that changes in income will lead to changes in both freedom and culture. However, if freedom or culture has a causal relationship with growth, we expect to observe a positive association between variations in these variables and economic growth in the following period. Therefore, we analyze variations in these variables instead of focusing on their levels, only for this specific parameter."," To investigate reverse causality more directly, we conduct a simple test that considers both lagged and future values of changes in freedom, culture, and economic growth. In case our findings are affected by reverse causation, we expect to see changes in income causing subsequent changes in both freedom and culture. However, if freedom and culture drive growth, we anticipate that changes in such variables be associated with subsequent changes in economic growth. Therefore, in this context, we focus on variations in these variables rather than their levels."
" The issue of extreme economic inequality poses a threat not only to social justice but also to the stability of the U.S. economy.

" Looking back at the 65 years following World War II, there are two distinct periods when it comes to economic inequality. The first three decades witnessed a reduction in inequality, while the next 30 years saw a rise in it, culminating in an economic crisis. The article examines the divergence between the two periods regarding the distribution of income and wealth, wages, unemployment rates, and poverty. It then delves into the political economy of the first period, highlighting the link between the capitalist economy and the democratic form of government. Although inequality persisted in the first era, British economist Andrew Shonfield referred to it as a time of ""new capitalism,"" where an upward trend in national income extended financial rewards to those who could not previously benefit from it. Shonfield also outlined the importance of attaining full employment in this period, as it allowed more people to earn more. In reviewing this period, it becomes clear that it was an irregularity in the annals of capitalism, mainly due to the federal government's more active role in the economy, reacting to the uncommon happenings that led up to it, like the Great Depression and World War II."," Following World War II, economic inequality can be split into two distinct phases spanning 65 years. The first 30 years saw a decline in inequality, while the subsequent 30 years led to a rise of inequality, which ultimately resulted in an economic crisis. The article examines the disparities between the two periods regarding income and wealth distribution, wages, unemployment, and poverty. It also describes the political economy of the first period, which focused on the relationship between the democratic form of government and the capitalist economy. Though inequality was still present in this era, it witnessed the rise of a ""new capitalism,"" where an increase in national income catered to individuals who were previously unable to share in the prosperity of the economy. Andrew Shonfield, a British economist, highlighted that deliberate efforts were made towards full employment during this period, leading to higher incomes for more people. However, in retrospect, this period was exceptional in the history of capitalism, primarily due to the US government's active participation in the economy, prompted by the country's unique circumstances such as the Great Depression and World War II."," The years following the Second World War present two distinct periods when considering economic inequality. The initial three decades saw a decline in inequality, while the following three decades track the rise of inequality, leading to economic turmoil. The article looks at the differences between the two periods in income and wealth distribution, wages, unemployment, and poverty. Additionally, it examines the political economy of the first period, highlighting the links between the democratic form of government and the capitalist system. Despite the persistence of inequality, the first period saw the emergence of a ""new capitalism."" Andrew Shonfield observed that the surge in national income extended financial rewards to those who had previously failed to benefit from this prosperity. Shonfield also recognises the importance of employing deliberate strategies towards full employment; this raised incomes for a more significant number of people. However, looking back, this period was an irregularity in the annals of capitalism, with such a government's more active participation and intervention in the economy initiated by a rare set of events like the Great Depression and World War II."
" The escalation of economic inequality has been a persistent issue in the past few decades and continues to pose a challenge. While many are aware of its existence, the ever-widening gap may still catch some by surprise. It is a glaring concern that is rife across numerous aspects of society, such as income, wealth, poverty, wages, and unemployment."," Over the past 30 years, the economic inequality divide has been on the rise and remains a cause for concern. Despite having knowledge of its existence, observing the extent of the gap can still be unsettling. The issue of inequality is widespread and apparent in different areas, such as income, wealth, poverty, wages, and unemployment, and needs to be addressed."," The past three decades have seen a steady increase in economic inequality, a trend that is concerning. Even those who are aware of this issue can be taken aback by the enormity of the gap. We see signs of inequality everywhere we look, from wealth, income, wages, poverty, to unemployment. The gravity of this problem demands action to ensure a more equitable society."
" The income disparities between the wealthiest 1 percent of households and the rest of the population are staggering. In 2007, just before the financial collapse, the top 1 percent had an average after-tax income of $1,319,700, which is almost a million dollars more than the 1979 average. This contrasts sharply with the middle and bottom quintiles, who only saw increases of $11,200 and $2,400, respectively, during the same period. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities' Sherman and Stone analyzed the data from the Congressional Budget Office and discovered that the gaps in after-tax income between the top 1 percent and the middle and poorest fifth more than tripled over the last three decades. They concluded that the extreme concentration of wealth at the top is now at its highest level since 1928, just before the severe financial downturn."," The income gains of the top 1 percent of households have reached exorbitant levels and represent a huge disparity when compared to the rest of the population. According to a report by the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 2010, the richest Americans had an average after-tax income of $1,319,700 in 2007, just before the financial crisis. This was an increase of $976,120 over the 1979 average, which makes the gap between the richest Americans and the middle and bottom quintiles all the more apparent, since the latter groups saw increases of only $11,200 and $2,400, respectively. Sherman and Stone of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities scrutinized the CBO data and noted that after-tax income disparities between the top 1 percent and the middle and poorest quintiles more than tripled between 1979 and 2007, suggesting a vast concentration of wealth at the top that has not been seen since 1928, the year before the severe financial crash."," The top 1 percent of households have experienced tremendous income gains that are both disproportionate and extreme compared to the rest of the population. The U.S Congressional Budget Office (CBO) 2010 report documented that the average after-tax income of the richest Americans in 2007 was $1,319,700, which represented a staggering increase of $976,120 over the 1979 average for the top earners. In contrast, the middle and bottom quintiles only experienced marginal increases of $11,200 and $2,400, respectively. Calculating from the CBO dataset, Sherman and Stone of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported that income disparities between the top 1 percent and the middle and poorest fifth of the population more than tripled from 1979 to 2007. This data suggests that income concentration at the top of the income scale is now at an unprecedented level since 1928, just before the disastrous financial crash."
" The distribution of wealth in the United States showcases a significant imbalance, with a minority holding a substantial portion of the wealth. Over the period of 1995 to 2004, household net wealth almost doubled, yet the vast majority of these gains went to the top 25% of income earners. By the year 2004, the richest 10% owned approximately 71% of private wealth. Edward Wolff, a respected expert in the field, conducted a comprehensive study called Top Heavy that highlights the growing inequality of wealth in the country."," The concentration of wealth in the United States is an increasingly pressing issue, with the distribution becoming more top-heavy in recent years. In a short span of time from 1995 to 2004, household net wealth almost doubled, but almost all of the net gains were enjoyed by the top quartile of income earners. As of 2004, the richest 10% possessed a staggering 71% of private wealth. Edward Wolff, a renowned scholar, penned the aptly titled Top Heavy study, which outlined the rising inequality of wealth in the nation."," Wealth disparity in the United States is a significant issue that has only worsened over time, with wealth distribution becoming increasingly top-heavy. During a period of 1995 to 2004, when aggregate household net wealth almost doubled, hardly any of the gains were made by those outside of the top 25% of income earners. By 2004, just 10% of the population owned 71% of the nation's private wealth. Edward Wolff, a prominent scholar in the field, published the Top Heavy study, which delves deeply into the escalating wealth inequality in the United States."
" The shared prosperity era saw a comparatively low unemployment rate, with an average of 4.8 percent between 1949 to 1973. However, in the decades following that period, the unemployment rate rose to an average of 6.5 percent from 1974 to 2008. Furthermore, high unemployment rates led to stagnant wages since employers could hire new employees without offering attractive benefits and working conditions. Additionally, rising unemployment not only results in lost income and increasing inequality, but it also contributes to a reduction in potential output for the economy. Conversely, a tightening in the labor market leads to an increase in wages, as seen in the 1990s when unemployment briefly dipped below 4 percent, greatly benefiting low-wage workers. Nevertheless, high unemployment has a significant impact on government budgets since it increases the number of benefits provided to jobless workers while reducing income and tax revenues."," During the shared prosperity era, while not very low, the unemployment rate was less than in the ensuing decades. The period between 1949 and 1973 saw an average unemployment rate of 4.8 percent, whereas it increased to 6.5 percent from 1974 to 2008. High unemployment rates lead to stagnant wages for workers, as employers do not need to improve working conditions or offer attractive benefits to new hires. Nevertheless, unemployment has broader ramifications as it results in lost income for workers, and inequality increases. Moreover, high unemployment results in a reduction in potential output for the economy. The converse is true when the labor market tightens, as wages and benefits rise for low-wage workers. This was seen in the 1990s, when unemployment fell below 4 percent, leading to improved wages, benefits, and working conditions. However, unemployment also leads to a decrease in tax revenues and increased government expenditure on benefits for jobless workers, contributing to budget deficits."," From 1949 to 1973, the United States experienced a shared prosperity era, with unemployment levels higher than today but less than in the following decades. The average unemployment rate was 4.8 percent during this period, compared to 6.5 percent between 1974 and 2008. Unemployment results in lost income for workers, stagnating wages and increasing inequality. Furthermore, it can limit the potential output of the economy and lead to budget deficits. Employers do not have to increase wages or provide attractive working conditions if there are more jobseekers than available positions. When the labor market contracts, as seen in the 1990s with unemployment dropping below 4 percent, wages, benefits, and working conditions improve, especially for low-wage earners. In contrast, high unemployment leads to decreased tax revenues and increased government support for jobless workers, further impacting the economy."
" During the Great Depression and World War II, the government responded to the severe economic challenges by taking over more control of the economy. This led to the government becoming larger and more active than it was before the depression. The policies of government spending and taxation decreased the impact of recessions and somewhat redistributed income. The social welfare measures of the 1930s, particularly the unemployment compensation, acted as economic stabilizers, expanding during times of economic downturns, which reduced the contraction of consumer spending, thereby improving the situation. The regulatory policies implemented during the New Deal era, intended to prevent another stock market crash, continued in the postwar era. The higher tax rates of World War II remained in place during peacetime, which led to increased real wages, resulting in relative labor peace. Despite criticisms concerning the violation of free-market economics, economist Robert Kuttner stated that the system was beneficial as it generated nearly three decades of egalitarian economic growth at an average annual rate of 3.8%."," The federal government responded to the economic turmoil of the Great Depression and World War II by exerting more control over the economy. This led to a larger and more involved government than before. With policies on government spending and taxation, the severity of recessions was reduced, and income was mildly redistributed.

Regulatory policies implemented in the New Deal aimed to prevent another stock market crash, and they were continued in the postwar era. Higher tax rates remained in place during the peacetime, resulting in a rise in real wages and relative labor peace.

" Businesses could have taken steps to level the playing field by investing in strategies that would help them become more productive and innovative. However, instead of doing so, they chose to implement alternative measures that resulted in an increase in inequality (Harrison & Bluestone, 1985). These measures including squeezing their labor force by using wage freezes, adopting new work arrangements to increase flexibility in hiring and firing employees, and shifting their operations to lower-wage areas through globalization. This strategy was encouraged by government policies that offer more favorable treatment for offshore profits, as well as financing overseas manufacturing plants. Additionally, some businesses abandoned production in favor of focusing on paper profits, leading to job losses. For instance, General Electric sold its consumer appliance manufacturing division to concentrate on its credit corporation, while General Motors placed priority on financial services than auto production (Wolff, 2009). Others chose to lobby for reduced taxes and regulations to boost their profits."," Due to their competitive disadvantage, businesses could have adopted investment strategies to increase productivity and innovation to become more competitive. However, instead of doing so, most companies opted for alternative measures leading to an increase in inequality (Harrison & Bluestone, 1985). Companies applied strategies such as wage freezes, new work arrangements, and shifts towards globalization by transferring their capital and operations to countries with lower wages. Such shifts were encouraged by government policies granting favorable terms for offshore earnings, leading to the financing of overseas manufacturing plants. In addition, businesses abandoned manufacturing for paper profits, resulting in job losses. For example, General Electric sold off its consumer appliance arm to concentrate on the more profitable credit corporation. Similarly, General Motors prioritized financial services over auto production (Wolff, 2009). Ultimately, such measures negatively affected the workforce. Companies also lobbied to reduce taxes and regulations to increase their profits."," To reduce their competitive disadvantage, businesses could have made investments to increase productivity and innovation.

" In the 1980s, Republicans found success in uniting their fiscally conservative, pro-business backers with a portion of the Democrats' New Deal coalition. These voters were turned off by a variety of policies associated with the Democratic party such as affirmative action, welfare expansion, school busing, women's liberation, gay rights, abortion, and high taxes. Many white people, including blue-collar workers, defected from the party they had once supported, viewing the Democrats as no longer aligned with their interests and unlikely to deliver prosperity. This shift away from the Democratic party was observed by Edsall (1991)."," Republicans were successful in joining the interests of their fiscally prudent and business-oriented supporters with a faction of the Democrats' New Deal coalition in the 1980s. This faction of voters felt as if policies such as affirmative action, expanding welfare programs, school busing, women's rights, LGBTQ rights, abortion, and high taxes were no longer serving their interests. Many people, specifically blue-collar workers, who once were a part of the Democratic party moved away from the party due to their belief that the party no longer represented their values and could not create prosperity. Edsall (1991) noted this transition."," In the 1980s, Republicans successfully united their fiscally conservative and pro-business supporters with a group of Democrats from the New Deal coalition.

" Despite being viewed as a progressive leader, Bill Clinton oversaw the abolishment of the AFDC program and the GlassSteagall Act, a cornerstone of New Deal financial regulation. With the removal of this act, banks could combine their commercial and investment activities, leading to high-risk investment practices. Additionally, Clinton continued the previous Republican administration's policies of globalization, devoid of any significant changes or advancements in promoting workers' rights or environmental protections."," While Bill Clinton projected the image of a progressive and populist leader, his actions tell a different story. He was responsible for the repeal of the AFDC program and the GlassSteagall Act, which led to the merging of commercial and investment banking and allowed the high-risk culture of investment banks to flourish. Clinton also maintained the policies of globalization, disregarding workers' rights and environmental protection, that were established by his predecessor George W. Bush. These actions undermine his public persona as a progressive leader."," Despite being perceived as a progressive champion, former President Bill Clinton's legislative record tells a contrasting story. He oversaw the repeal of the AFDC program and the GlassSteagall Act, which allowed commercial and investment banking activities to commingle, resulting in the adoption of high-risk investment practices by banks. Furthermore, Clinton's policies on globalization were inconsistent with workers' rights and the protection of the environment, which continued to exist unchanged under his leadership. These decisions contradict the progressive narrative that he projected, leaving a questionable legacy as a progressive leader."
" The financial sector's influence was apparent in President-elect Bill Clinton's shift away from his populist rhetoric during his campaign. While promising to prioritize the people's needs in building an economy, he recognized that the wealthy controlled the system ahead of his inauguration. He also understood that reducing the deficit would aid bond market investors while hurting those who had supported him. Robert Rubin, a key member of Wall Street behemoth Goldman Sachs and a high-ranking member of the Clinton administration, was just one influential voice among several counselors proposing that the new leader concentrate on lowering the budget shortfall."," President-elect Bill Clinton faced pressure from the financial industry to abandon his populist campaign message. Clinton had promised to prioritize the needs of ordinary people in building a robust economy. However, before taking office, he realized that the well-off were the ones who were calling the shots in the economic system. He acknowledged that reducing deficits to benefit bondholders would hurt the voters who had put him in power. Robert Rubin, the co-senior partner of Goldman Sachs, was one of many advisers pushing Clinton to emphasize deficit reduction. Rubin later headed Clinton's National Economic Council and served as Treasury Secretary."," The financial sector's influence on President-elect Bill Clinton was apparent when he deviated from his campaign's populism.

"According to economist Arthur MacEwan (2009), the economic meltdown resulted from a complex set of interrelated factors. These included the growing concentration of political and social power among the wealthy, the rise of a market-driven ideology that supported this power, and increasing inequality that reinforced these trends. MacEwan's perspective considers the entire economy, from its highest levels to its lowest levels. The confluence of these factors resulted in several proximate developments that contributed to the meltdown, including the increased availability of credit, reduced regulation, and the housing bubble. These developments will be explored more thoroughly later on.","Economist Arthur MacEwan (2009) identified a combination of factors that led to the economic meltdown, highlighting the nexus of power, ideology, and inequality as key drivers. This perspective accounts for the entire economic system, from the highest echelons to the lowest.

Further exploration of these developments will be undertaken later.","The economic meltdown was the result of a complex set of factors, according to economist Arthur MacEwan (2009). MacEwan pointed to the growing concentration of power among the wealthy, the ascendency of a laissez-faire ideology, and rising inequality, all of which reinforced and accentuated each other. MacEwan's perspective is comprehensive, spanning from the highest economic levels to the lowest. The intersection of these factors led to a range of changes that directly contributed to the meltdown, such as increased credit availability, deregulation, and the housing bubble. Further detail on these factors will be forthcoming later."
" The United States has experienced a significant decline in the variety of viewpoints available in the media, due in large part to the consolidation of media ownership. In just over two decades, the control of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations, book publishers, and movie companies has dwindled from 50 to only five companies, leading to what has been called a ""media monopoly."" As a result, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), a nonprofit media watchdog, has raised serious concerns about the impact of these mergers and acquisitions, which have further stifled dissenting voices and reduced opportunities for different perspectives to be heard. All of this has left the media beholden to the interests of their owners, shaping the narratives presented to the public accordingly."," Concentrations of media ownership in the United States have contributed to a worrying decline in the diversity of viewpoints made available to the public. Between 1983 and 2004, the number of corporations controlling most newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations, book publishers, and movie companies shrank dramatically from 50 to just five. As a result, watchdogs like Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) have criticized these mergers and acquisitions, arguing that they restrict the spectrum of perspectives that can access mass media. This trend creates a media environment in which the viewpoints presented to the public are largely determined by the interests of the media conglomerates that own them, rather than by a wide array of perspectives."," In the United States, the shrinking number of media corporations dominating newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations, book publishers, and movie companies has led to a concerning limitation in the range of views and opinions available to the public. This consolidation of media ownership has been a slowly unfolding trend since 1983, with only five major media corporations controlling much of the media landscape by 2004. Critical voices have called attention to the fact that media mergers increasingly diminish the number of different perspectives reached by mass media. Consequently, the viewpoints represented in mainstream U.S. media are often determined and shaped by the interests of a small group of media conglomerates' owners."
" The perspective concerning agency and choice differs among individuals and is likewise evident in capitalist countries' political economies, which are not uniform. Some countries, for instance, are not against ""big government."" After conducting cross-national studies, it is found that capitalist countries vary significantly from one another in their poverty prevention efforts, as well as the scope and size of their welfare states. In spite of experiencing cutbacks, comparative poverty rates across nations are vastly different. For instance, in 2000, France and Germany had poverty rates of 7.3% and 8.4%, respectively, while the United States had a rate of 17.0%. The United Kingdom and Canada had lower rates, at 13.7% and 12.4%, respectively, than in the U.S. Countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden had even lower rates, which ranged from 5.4% to 6.6%.

" To mitigate the potential risk of subprime mortgages, financial entities turned to derivatives, complex financial instruments. Derivatives ended up being the crux of the housing bubble, its collapse, and the subsequent bailout. One form of derivative extensively popular among banks that purchased subprime mortgages was credit-default swaps. These swaps were packages of mortgage loans insured by banks seeking to manage their risk. Since government regulation controlled insurance, sellers coined the term ""credit default swaps"" to bypass those regulations. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission head recognized the need to regulate derivatives in 1998 but met with resistance from influential individuals such as Clinton's Treasury Secretary, Robert Rubin, his deputy, Lawrence Summers, as well as Federal Reserve Chief Alan Greenspan."," Derivatives were introduced to downplay the risk of subprime mortgages. However, they became integral to the housing bubble, its ultimate burst, and the consequent bailout. Credit-default swaps were a kind of derivatives that was used by banks that purchased subprime mortgages as packages of mortgages insured by the banks themselves to restrict the risk. Sellers coined these swaps ""credit default swaps"" to circumvent government regulation since insurance was thoroughly monitored.

" After exploring the issue of economic inequality, it is evident that there are several potential solutions to ease the problem. One possible solution is to promote greater access to affordable housing through policies such as rent control and increased funding for public housing projects. It is also crucial to ensure that all workers are paid a living wage to support their basic needs. Additionally, expanding social welfare programs to cover a broader range of services and increasing the level of benefits could provide more support to those in need. Furthermore, establishing stricter regulations on the financial sector to prevent the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few is essential. Overall, these solutions must be implemented simultaneously to yield a significant impact on reducing economic inequality."," Addressing economic inequality requires a multi-pronged approach that goes beyond simply increasing social welfare programs or promoting labor union membership. A significant step towards reducing economic inequality involves strengthening our education systems to provide all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, with access to quality education. This means expanding educational resources and providing more opportunities for training and workforce development programs that improve occupational skillsets. Another vital strategy for reducing economic inequality is to create more opportunities for small business owners and entrepreneurs, by offering low-interest loans, grants, and specialized resources. Lastly, increasing the availability and affordability of healthcare can benefit many low and middle-income individuals who are burdened by medical bills or cannot afford adequate care. By prioritizing and implementing these strategies simultaneously, we can make a significant impact on reducing economic inequality."," Economic inequality has become an issue that affects not only individuals but also society as a whole. One possible solution is to improve income distribution by introducing tax reform that ensures the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share. Another solution is implementing vocational training programs and apprenticeships to promote diversified skill sets among individuals. Efforts can also be made to support underserved and minority communities by improving the availability and access to capital and funding for their businesses. Furthermore, incentivizing companies to relocate to low-income areas, and offering tax breaks or subsidies could build stronger communities and promote economic growth. Promoting universal basic income could also lessen the burden faced by those in lower-income brackets by providing a basic floor to cover essential needs. In conclusion, addressing economic inequality requires policies that are both comprehensive and far-reaching."
" The concept of job creation bears resemblance to the work programs introduced by social workers Harry Hopkins and Aubrey Williams, which were part of the New Deal initiative. Nevertheless, these programs were not inclusive enough since they did not cater to the needs of women and minorities as much. Improving the New Deal model can be achieved by considering social jobs, including child care, elder care, education, and health care, alongside physical infrastructure. In addition, reviving U.S. manufacturing through new economic policies could enhance job opportunities and reduce reliance on the financial sector. Due to the magnitude of this change, the federal government would have to play a significant role. (Rose, 2010; Pollin & Baker, 2009)."," In terms of job creation, similarities can be seen between today's approach and the Roosevelt-era New Deal programs supervised by social workers Harry Hopkins and Aubrey Williams. Nevertheless, these initiatives were deemed subpar for they failed to offer jobs to women and minorities equitably. Building on the New Deal model involves highlighting jobs that cater to society's well-being, such as child care, elderly care, education, and healthcare, along with physical infrastructure improvements. Additionally, a change in economic policy, emphasizing U.S. manufacturing, could boost employment opportunities while reducing the market's dependence on the financial sector. To make these significant adjustments, substantial intervention and collaboration from the federal government are required. (Rose, 2010; Pollin & Baker, 2009)."," The creation of job opportunities can be likened to the work programs implemented by social workers Harry Hopkins and Aubrey Williams under the New Deal initiative. However, these programs had a significant downside as they did not provide adequate employment opportunities for women and minorities who needed them the most. Improving the New Deal model necessitates focusing on social jobs such as child care, elderly care, education, and health care, as well as concentrating on the physical infrastructure. To revitalize U.S. manufacturing, a new industrial policy is required which can offer more employment opportunities and lessen dependence on the financial sector. The involvement of the federal government is essential to make these changes. (Rose, 2010; Pollin & Baker, 2009)."

" Despite the crucial role that social workers played in government job creation initiatives during the 1930s, their focus has largely shifted towards welfare rather than employment opportunities. However, the current state of high unemployment rates has resulted in millions of people struggling to find work or engage in only marginally employed jobs, negatively impacting their socioeconomic status, and making it more difficult for them to fit into socially valued roles. Social workers can contribute towards reducing inequality by supporting organizations that advocate for direct job creation by the government. Additionally, they can contribute towards wage campaigns aimed at improving the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit, both of which hold the potential to reduce inequality. By supporting the Employee Free Choice Act of 2009 (H.R. 1409), social workers can help reduce firing and harassment of workers involved in organizing unions, which will help strengthen the labor movement and promote equality. Lastly, social workers can empower themselves to join unions and join in the advocacy of labor reforms that benefit all workers."," Social workers played a critical role in government job creation initiatives during the 1930s. However, the profession has since shifted its focus to welfare rather than employment. The current rate of unemployment, even at half its current level, has far-reaching social and economic impacts. It has left millions jobless or marginally employed and has caused a subsequent loss of income and a valued social role. Inequality reduction can be achieved through the participation of social workers in organizations that advocate for government-initiated direct job creation. Living-wage campaigns that aim to elevate the minimum wage rate and the Earned Income Tax Credit can help decrease inequality as well. The advocacy for stronger worker-led reforms can lead to empowerment and favorable labor outcomes. Social workers can also empower themselves by joining unions and advocating for labor reform changes that benefit all workers."," Although social workers were instrumental in creating government jobs in the 1930s, their attention has since been mainly focused on welfare instead of promoting work opportunities. The high rate of unemployment, even if it were to decrease, will result in a large number of workers remaining unemployed or only marginally employed. This will lead to financial and social inequalities. To address inequality, social workers should participate in organizations that advocate for direct job creation by the government. Wage campaigns that aim to increase minimum wages and the Earned Income Tax Credit may also help reduce inequality. The labor movement's effectiveness can be enhanced by supporting the Employee Free Choice Act of 2009 (H.R.1409) and encouraging social workers to become members. This will allow them to advocate for labor's commitment to improving conditions for all workers in addition to being a driving force for change."
" It is evident that a considerable number of families with above average earnings, including social workers, struggle to keep up with the rising cost of living. The situation makes them vulnerable to the risk of predatory lenders, which raises questions about who is protecting them from financial harm. In the past, consumer protection and regulatory advocates took it upon themselves to safeguard families in need, including vulnerable social workers. In addition to teaching financial literacy, social workers should lobby for the implementation of recent consumer protection legislation to prevent financial exploitation."," Many families who make above median income, which includes social workers, find themselves struggling to meet their basic needs due to the high cost of living. This situation leaves them susceptible to predatory lending, and their vulnerability is a cause of concern. Who is responsible for protecting these families from financial harm?

" Greece became a member of the Eurozone in 2001 and experienced a relatively short period of economic success before encountering a significant financial crisis about nine years later.

" Greece experienced a significant economic downturn in 2009, marking one of its toughest periods in recent times. This unforeseeable event garnered global attention, particularly as the country was initially placed in the first group of Eurozone countries. Prior to this, the Greek economy was flourishing with the Olympic Games and a decreasing unemployment rate in 2004. The conservative ND party's victory in the 2004 election put an end to the PASOK's 11-year-long tenure and unearthed traces of corruption in governance. The opposition leader Kostas Karamanlis promised to tackle corruption and bring about essential reforms."," The Greek economy was hit by a severe economic crisis in 2009.

" In 2009, Greece was facing a serious economic crisis as their debt and budget deficit had grown uncomfortably high.

A series of scandals and resignations of three ministers from the ND party was another reason for the sudden election call. During the electoral campaign, Karamanlis did not make promises concerning the economic policy his party would follow after the election, choosing instead to build a reputation for sincerity about the actual economic situation of the country, which he blamed on the global financial crisis. PASOK won the election by a considerable majority and argued that the previous government's poor management of the economy was the cause of the country's economic woes."," Greece's economic situation reached a critical point in 2009, when the country's debt and budget deficit rose to dangerous levels.

" The concept of economic voting suggests that voters make rational judgments about the economy's past performance, and they are not considered fools whilst doing so. Although prospective evaluations may also matter, but assessing future outcomes is much more difficult than analyzing past policies. According to Key, voters evaluate policy performance based on their personal perceptions and beliefs, encouraging them to reward or punish the government in power. Fiorina further validated Key's argument about retrospective assessments, emphasizing that the electorate had a harder piece of information, which was their own experience of living under the incumbent's administration. Therefore, voters hold the government responsible, either by re-electing them or by punishing them."," The principle of economic voting suggests that voters make logical decisions concerning the economy's past performance, and they are not considered gullible whilst doing so.

" When it comes to economic voting patterns in Greece, there is a considerable lack of systematic analyses available, and only a handful of studies have attempted to provide an understanding of how people vote based on their perceived economic impact. Freire and Costa Lobo's (2005) comparative study examining objective economic indicators and subjective individual perceptions of the economy between 1984 and 1999 found that in Greece, there is a correlation between personal financial perceptions and annual GDP changes. However, their work only examined historical data, and more recent studies are necessary to determine if economic evaluations are still influential in modern Greek voting behavior. Furthermore, the authors discovered that ideology was the most crucial factor driving party choice during the period studied, and it remains unclear to what extent economic issues are accounted for in such an ideological framework. Given these considerations, more research is necessary to understand the complexities of economic voting in Greece."," The existing studies on economic voting in Greece are limited in number and have failed to provide a systematic analysis of the phenomenon.

Their findings suggested that personal financial perceptions in Greece are correlated with annual GDP changes. However, data from more recent elections are missing to determine if these patterns hold true in contemporary Greek elections. Additionally, the authors discovered that ideology played a more significant role than economic issues in party choices, revealing the importance of contextualizing economic voting within broader political beliefs.

" The correlation between macroeconomic performance and the incumbent party's support stems from the reward-punishment hypothesis, which suggests that voters gauge the government's performance based on the major economic indicators such as inflation and unemployment. The electorate then rewards or punishes the current party based on their ability to maintain desirable levels of these indicators. Ultimately, the government is held accountable for its economic policies. Additionally, the opposition parties stand to benefit if they can demonstrate that current party's performance is lacking. This theory was first presented by Sanders in 2000 and has been reinforced by Lewis-Beck in 1988 and Powell and Whitten in 1993."," The relationship between macroeconomic performance and the incumbent party's support is closely linked to the reward-punishment hypothesis. This theory suggests that voters evaluate the government's performance on major economic indicators like inflation and unemployment. Subsequently, they reward or punish the party in power based on their ability to maintain desirable levels of these indicators. In other words, the government is answerable for its economic policies. Furthermore, opposition parties can use their rival's performance against them, gaining support if they can prove the incumbent's policies are inadequate. The origin of this theory goes back to earlier works discussed by Lewis-Beck in 1988 and Powell and Whitten in 1993 and was revisited by Sanders in 2000."," The reward-punishment hypothesis links macroeconomic performance to the support for the incumbent party. According to this theory, voters evaluate the government's economic performance based on major indicators such as unemployment and inflation. If the government can maintain desirable levels of these indicators, they are rewarded with support from the electorate. However, if their performance is inadequate, voters may punish the incumbent party by casting their vote for the opposition. Essentially, the government is responsible for their economic policy-making, and any failure or success reflects on the voters' choice of candidates. As an opposition, political parties can gain voters' support by highlighting the incumbent's failure to maintain a stable economy. The reward-punishment hypothesis was first proposed by Sanders in 2000, building on theories presented by Lewis-Beck in 1988 and Powell and Whitten in 1993."
" According to studies conducted on German and British data, it seems that Mueller's hypotheses, which state that economic conditions only affect the electorate when they experience significant deterioration, are true (as referenced in Nannestad and Paldam, 1997, p.85). However, when looking at individual-level analysis, efforts to verify the ""grievance hypothesis"" have not been fruitful, with the exception of examining the Danish electorate (as cited in Nannestad and Paldam, 1997). Conversely, van der Brug and colleagues (2007) have found support for the concept of ""grievance asymmetry."" In their cross-national assessment of economic voting, they observed meaningful differences between the impact of improving and deteriorating economic conditions, which did not align with Lewis-Beck's (1988) expectation for near-zero coefficients when economic conditions were improving. However, the authors' more lax definition of what constituted an asymmetry explains this divergence (van der Brug et al., 2007, pp. 142¨C159)."," Empirical research on German and British data provides evidence in support of Mueller's hypothesis that the electorate's response to economic conditions is only noticeable when there is a sharp deterioration in economic conditions (see Nannestad and Paldam, 1997, 85).

Studies examining the ""grievance hypothesis"" have not been very successful when examined at the individual level, except for research involving the Danish electorate (Nannestad and Paldam, 1997).

" The impact of economic shifts on Greek elections has been studied through individual-level simulations. The findings revealed that voters were more likely to reward the governing party when the economy improved, and the rewards were slightly more significant than the punishments. The absence of coalition governments in Greece has made it a high-clarity country that makes it easy for voters to pin responsibility on the party accountable for government policies. The country's political system has been marked by stable single-party governments, and this could be linked to the disproportional electoral system, referred to as ""reinforced proportional representation,"" which has been modified several times since 1974 when democracy was restored. Other parties have remained in opposition, while ND and PASOK have alternated in government, with the exception of the quasicaretaker coalition governments of 1989-1990."," An individual-level simulation was conducted to determine the effects of economic changes on the results of Greek elections. It was discovered that when the economy improved, voters tended to reward the governing party, and the rewards were slightly stronger than the punishments. Greece's lack of coalition governments makes it a high-clarity country, allowing voters to quickly identify the party responsible for government policies. The country's stable single-party governments have been a fixture of the Greek party system, primarily due to the disproportional electoral system named ""reinforced proportional representation."" Since democracy was reinstated in 1974, the system has been revised several times. ND and PASOK have alternated in power, with the exception of the quasicaretaker coalition governments of 1989-1990, while all other parties have stayed in opposition."," Greek elections have been subject to individual-level simulations measuring the consequences of economic changes. Results of the study show a trend of rewarding the governing party when the economy improves, with more substantial rewards than punishments. Greece is considered a high-clarity country due to the absence of coalition governments, making it easy for voters to identify and hold the government policy-makers accountable. The country's single-party governments have been stable, mainly because of the disproportional electoral system known locally as ""reinforced proportional representation."" The system has been modified several times since the return of democracy in 1974, contributing to the consistency of ND and PASOK in governance, with the exception of the quasicaretaker coalition governments of 1989-1990. All other parties have remained in opposition."
" Fig. 1 demonstrates a somewhat inconsistent situation in the scatterplots, with some indications of an asymmetry between the changes in the economy and the vote share for the ruling party. Examining each macro-economic indicator one by one, it can be seen that a decline in GDP leads to a decrease in the incumbent party's vote share and vice versa. Also, there seems to be a specific point where incumbents are not rewarded for improving growth indicators. When it comes to inflation, an increase between particular limits (up to 17%) doesn't result in a decrease in vote share; contrary to that, voters seemingly encourage the prevailing party. Interestingly, after this point, there is a visible decline in the vote share for the incumbent party; although the number of observations after this point is limited. Similarly, unemployment rates' changes between particular limits (-1 to 1%) don't have any effect on the vote share, ushering in a flat curve. Again, there is a marked decline in the vote share for the incumbents after the specific limit, indicating a punishment."," The data in Fig. 1, with a bandwidth of 0.7, reveal a complicated situation, with some aspects suggesting an asymmetry between alterations in the state of the economy and vote share for the governing party. Focusing on each macroeconomic indicator individually, one can see that there is a correlation between declining GDP and a drop in the vote share for the incumbent party, and an increase in GDP results in the opposite. However, there seems to be a specific point where incumbents no longer receive praise for their efforts to improve growth indicators. Looking at inflation, a rise up to around 17% doesn't appear to harm the incumbent's vote share. On the contrary, there appears to be a slight reward from voters. After this mark, nonetheless, the incumbent party's vote share dramatically drops, though the number of observations after this threshold is scarce. Additionally, changes in the unemployment rate between a change of +/-1% present no connection to the vote share, creating a near-flat curve. Similar to the findings in relation to inflation, there appears to be a notable dropout point where incumbents lose favor."," Fig. 1 portrays a complex scenario regarding the scatterplots with some indications of an asymmetry between the modifications in the economy and the vote share for the ruling party. When each macroeconomic factor is considered separately, it appears that a decline in GDP results in a fall in the incumbent party's vote share and the opposite is also correct. Interestingly, there is a certain threshold beyond which incumbents are not rewarded for raising growth indicators. Moving to inflation, there seems to be no harmful effect for the incumbent's vote share up to a specific limit (about 17%). Instead, voters seem to slightly favor the prevailing party. Beyond this point, however, there is a significant decline in the vote share for the incumbent party, although there is not enough data beyond this limit to draw any solid conclusions. Similarly, the impact of the unemployment rate changes between +/-1% remains almost negligible in influencing the vote share, leading to a flat curve. The threshold of favoritism, nonetheless, varies and results in a sharp downturn after a specific cut-off point."
" To investigate the effects of economic variables on support for the incumbent party, I utilized a logistic regression analysis. The dependent variable was coded in such a way that a score of 1 denoted support for the incumbent party, while a score of 0 indicated support for any of the opposing parties (in accordance with previous research undertaken by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau, 2000; Evans and Andersen, 2006). The logistic regression method was beneficial in being able to estimate the probability of a voter selecting the incumbent party versus the opposition, and how this probability changed as economic perceptions shifted. It is relevant to note that in most studies, a voter's choice is influenced by a variety of factors, such as economic evaluations (which produce temporary effects), party identification and ideology (which have long-term effects), and demographics like age and gender (Clarke et al., 2004)."," Examining the relationship between economic variables and support for the incumbent party, I performed a logistic regression analysis. I coded the dependent variable as 1 to indicate support for the incumbent party and 0 to indicate support for the opposition, based on the research conducted by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2000) and Evans and Andersen (2006). The purpose of the logistic regression method was to determine the probability of voters selecting the incumbent party compared to opposing parties and to observe how this probability shifts as economic perceptions change. However, as demonstrated in most studies, the decision of a voter is influenced by various factors, including temporary effects such as economic evaluations, long-term effects like party identification and ideology, and demographics such as age and gender (Clarke et al., 2004)."," In order to investigate how economic variables impact support for the incumbent party, I conducted a logistic regression analysis. The dependent variable was coded as 1 if the respondent intended to vote for the incumbent party and 0 if they intended to support any other party from the opposition, based on existing studies conducted by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2000) and Evans and Andersen (2006). The goal of the logistic regression model was to estimate the likelihood that a voter would choose the incumbent party over opposing parties, and then to measure changes in this probability as economic beliefs changed. It is crucial to note, however, that voting decisions are always influenced by various factors, including temporary effects like economic evaluations, long-term effects like party identification and ideology, and demographic characteristics like age and gender (Clarke et al., 2004)."
" The data presented in Fig. 2 suggest a substantial increase in the percentage of voters who evaluated the economy negatively when comparing the 2004 and 2009 elections. In 2004, only 24.4% of voters viewed the economy as a lot worse, while in 2009, this number had grown to 43.9%, which occurred a few months before Greece agreed to a bailout package with the IMF/EU. To determine whether economic concerns had a significant impact on voters' decision-making, Whiteley et al. (2005) measured issue salience in both surveys by asking responders to name the most pressing problem facing the country. In both elections, voters' top priority was the economy, with inflation and unemployment being the most frequently mentioned concerns. Notably, the significance of the economy as the most crucial issue increased by approximately 20% from 2004 to 2009, while the importance of unemployment decreased."," According to the information presented in Fig. 2, there was a significant increase in the percentage of voters who negatively evaluated the economy when the 2004 and 2009 elections were compared.

To determine the role of economic considerations on voters' minds, Whiteley et al. (2005) measured issue salience in both surveys. An open-ended question asking responders to name the most important problem facing the country was used to measure this. Voters in both elections viewed economic issues as the most critical problem in their minds, with the economy in general, unemployment, and inflation being the most important issues.

" The study's outcomes are presented in Table 1. As predicted, the coefficients for the economic variable are both statistically significant and in line with the anticipated direction. During the 2004 national election, voters located on the left side of the ideological spectrum were more disposed to supporting the socialist governing party PASOK. This trend persisted among voters who indicated their belief that the previous year's economic situation had been positive and those who identified with the incumbent. No sociodemographic factors demonstrated any statistically significant influence. A similar trend was reproduced by the 2009 estimates. Voters who evaluated the economy positively were more prone to supporting the incumbent, which in this case was the conservative ND. Therefore, those individuals who placed themselves towards the right of the ideological spectrum were also more inclined to vote for ND. These results suggest that economic evaluations play a crucial role in determining support for the incumbent party. Even if the 2004 macroeconomic measures indicated satisfactory performance, assessments of the economy's past performance had a substantial association with support for the incumbent party during the electoral campaign."," Empirical results of the study are highlighted in Table 1. As per the hypothesis, the coefficients of the economic variable turned out to be statistically significant and aligned with expectations. During the 2004 national election in Greece, voters aligned to the left side of the ideological spectrum showed more support to the incumbent socialist governing party, PASOK. This trend persisted among those who believed the economic situation was positive the year before the election and those who identified with the incumbent. There was no evidence to suggest that sociodemographic variables had any significant impact. The findings were reiterated during the 2009 estimates, where voters with positive evaluations of the economy were more likely to vote for the conservative ND incumbent. Therefore, individuals on the right side of the ideological spectrum also inclined towards ND. The study establishes a substantive link between the Greek electorate's economic evaluations and support for the incumbent party. Despite positive macroeconomic measures in 2004, retrospective evaluations of the economic situation had a strong association with support for the incumbent party."," The results of the study are presented in Table 1. As anticipated, the coefficients of the economic variable were statistically significant and aligned with expectations.

Similarly, voters who believed the economic situation to be positive the preceding year and those who identified with the incumbent party also exhibited support for PASOK. However, sociodemographic variables were found to be statistically insignificant. The same pattern occurred during the 2009 election, with voters positively evaluating the economy showing inclination towards the incumbent, the conservative ND. Hence, voters positioned towards the right of the ideological spectrum also inclined towards ND. Economic assessments by the Greek electorate proved to be significantly associated with support for the incumbent party. Furthermore, retrospective assessments of the economy levelled significant importance to the issue during the electoral campaign, despite the strong macroeconomic performance in 2004."
" Dealing with endogeneity in cross-sectional data regression models is a daunting task as we do not have appropriate exogenous instruments to tackle it. Therefore, a counterfactual argument is proposed to combat this issue. If we assume endogeneity to be an omitted variable problem, we must assess the magnitude of the effect that this variable would have to present to invalidate the findings in Table 1. In light of the potent insights already accounted for in the model, such as party identification and left-right self-placement, it is difficult to identify another explanatory variable that could correctly predict incumbent party support with an odds ratio of at least 1.8.3. Despite overestimating economic evaluations' effect on backing the incumbent, it is positively certain that such an impact exists."," Addressing endogeneity in cross-sectional data regression models poses a significant challenge as suitable exogenous instruments are usually hard to come by. Instead, a counterfactual argument can be utilized to address the issue. If we interpret endogeneity as an omitted variable problem, we must evaluate the size of the effect that the missing variable would have to render the results depicted in Table 1 invalid. Given the robust predictors already present in the model, including party identification and left-right self-placement, it is dubious to identify another explanatory variable that could predict support for the incumbent party with an odds ratio of at least 1.8.3. Hence, it is fair to conclude that although the impact of economic evaluations on support for the incumbent may be mildly overestimated, it is unmistakably present."," Solving endogeneity in cross-sectional data regression models can be incredibly challenging since exogenous instruments are often scarce. Therefore, a counterfactual argument is presented to address the matter, treating endogeneity as an omitted variable problem.

Identifying another suitable explanatory variable that could predict incumbent party support with an odds ratio of at least 1.8.3 is unlikely. As a result, albeit the impact of economic evaluations on support for the incumbent may be slightly overstated, its existence is undoubtedly present."
" The purpose of the article is to investigate the connection between the state of the economy and voting patterns for the years 2004 and 2009 in Greece. Specifically, the study focuses on the implications of this relationship on electoral support for incumbent parties. The macro-level analysis that explores the connection between macroeconomic indicators and support for incumbent parties reveals thresholds that suggest some proof for the ""grievance asymmetry"" hypothesis. As in most other countries, voters in Greece appear to punish the ruling party in times of economic difficulties instead of rewarding them when economic conditions are improving. However, the non-parametric techniques utilized in the study prevent the authors from making inferences and definitive conclusions. A multilevel economic voting analysis that includes Greece indicates that rewards are just as probable as penalties in the Greek context. Future studies should investigate the issue of ""grievance asymmetry"" in spite of the limited Greek electoral data available."," The article delves into the correlation between the economy and voting behavior in Greece during the 2004 and 2009 election years, examining its effects on support for incumbent parties. The study analyzes the connection between macroeconomic indicators and support for the ruling party through an aggregate-level investigation, revealing evidence for the ""grievance asymmetry"" theory manifesting as thresholds. Similar to other countries, the Greek electorate appears to penalize the party in power during economic downturns, rather than rewarding it when economic conditions improve. Nonetheless, non-parametric analysis prohibits drawing definite inferences. A multilevel economic voting analysis that includes Greece suggests rewards are equally likely to occur as punishments in the Greek context when accounting for individual-level covariates.

" The results presented in Figs. 4 and 5 indicate that there is a positive relationship between positive evaluations of the economy and the probability of voting for the incumbent party. However, the overlapping confidence intervals between different levels of evaluation suggest that small changes in mean evaluations among the electorate would not have a substantial impact on the probability of voting for the incumbent party, with the exception of the shift from ""much worse"" to ""much better"" evaluations in 2004. The figures show that there may be an interaction between a party's position on the Left-Right scale and the gains it can make from positive evaluations of the economy. For example, the centrist position of PASOK may allow it to gain support from across the ideological spectrum, while right-wing ND may face more uncertainty when trying to gain support from the left. The expert surveys used in this study include the 2003 Benoit and Laver (2006) survey for the 2004 election and the Vowles and Xezonakis (2009) survey for the 2009 election."," According to Figs. 4 and 5, there appears to be a correlation between an increasing positive evaluation of the economy and an increasing likelihood that voters will support the incumbent party. However, the confidence intervals between adjacent plots for different levels of evaluation about the economy are mostly overlapping, which means that marginal changes in mean evaluations among the electorate are unlikely to significantly affect the probability of voting for the incumbent party, except for a notable shift from ""much worse"" to ""much better"" evaluations in 2004. Additionally, the figures suggest that a political party's position on the Left-Right scale may influence the effectiveness of their messaging around positive evaluations of the economy. For instance, a centrist party like PASOK may be able to gain support from across the ideological spectrum, while right-wing ND might find it more challenging to appeal to left-leaning voters. The expert surveys referenced in this study include the 2003 Benoit and Laver (2006) survey for the 2004 election and the Vowles and Xezonakis (2009) survey for the 2009 election."," Fig. 4 and 5 illustrate the relationship between evaluations about the economy and the probability of voting for the incumbent party.

Additionally, the figures suggest that a party's position on the Left-Right political scale might have an influence on the effectiveness of messaging strategies for positive evaluations of the economy. In particular, PASOK, as a centrist party, may be better positioned to appeal to voters across the political spectrum, while right-wing parties like ND could struggle to win support from left-leaning voters.

" The study's results do not necessarily negate the possibility of economic voting in 2009. As shown in Table 1, economic evaluations held weight in both elections. However, Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate that this impact did not generate substantial electoral returns for the ruling party. Specifically, the odds ratio for party identification in June 2009 was high, indicating that only the most dedicated supporters of the conservatives were inclined to vote for the incumbent ND. This was corroborated in the parliamentary election of October 2009, wherein ND achieved its lowest electoral outcome in its 35-year history (Gemenis, 2010, 358). Overall, while economic evaluations held a crucial role throughout the elections, their effect on the electoral returns was limited."," The study does not dismiss the possibility of economic voting in 2009. The results in Table 1 reveal that economic evaluations played a significant role in both elections. However, when considering the evidence in Figs. 4 and 5, it becomes apparent that this impact could not translate into substantial electoral returns for the party in power. This was especially true in the case of the 2009 parliamentary election, where the high odds ratio for party identification in Table 1 suggested that only the most committed supporters of the conservatives planned to vote for the incumbent ND. This was proven correct when ND achieved its poorest electoral result in history four months after the data was collected (Gemenis, 2010, 358). Nonetheless, while economic evaluations were undoubtedly influential in both elections, their effect on the electoral outcome was limited."," The presence of economic voting in the 2009 election is not dismissed by the study's results. Economic evaluations did indeed play a role in both elections, as confirmed by the data in Table 1. However, when the evidence in Figs. 4 and 5 is analyzed, it becomes clear that this impact could not generate significant electoral returns for the ruling party. This was especially apparent in the 2009 parliamentary election, where the high odds ratio for party identification in Table 1 indicated that only the conservatives' most ardent supporters intended to vote for the incumbent ND at that time. As a result, the worst electoral result in the party's 35-year history was recorded four months later (Gemenis, 2010, 358). Despite the fact that economic evaluations were critical in the elections, their impact on the electoral returns was minimal."
" The research on economic voting indicates that the incumbent's chance of winning an election is strengthened by solid economic performance. The topic of whether voters in financially vulnerable circumstances are more inclined to cast an economic vote, however, has not been settled. This article proposes that the degree of exposure to economic risks is a crucial determinant of individual-level variations in economic voting, as the risk exposure determines the significance of the economy in deciding to vote. The article concentrates on job insecurity and employment potential as key drivers of economic voting trends. The thesis hypothesises that economic voting is more significant among voters who are more susceptible to unemployment and have poor employment opportunities in the event of job loss. The findings support these theories, as evidenced by a study that used a dataset combining survey data on incumbent support with occupational unemployment rates and other measures of risk exposure to the economy."," The literature on economic voting shows that incumbents' chances of winning elections are boosted by robust economic performance. Nevertheless, there remains a debate about whether voters who are in precarious economic situations are more likely to cast economic votes. This article argues that the degree of exposure to economic risks is a fundamental factor in explaining the variation in economic voting at the individual level, since the degree of risk exposure affects the significance of the economy in voting decisions. Specifically, the focus is on job security and employability as the primary determinants of economic voting patterns. The article proposes that economic voting is more widespread among voters who are at greater risk of unemployment and have fewer employment opportunities in the event of job loss. The study supports these hypotheses, as demonstrated by the use of a dataset that combines incumbent support survey data with occupational unemployment rates and other indicators of exposure to economic risks."," The concept of economic voting posits that positive economic performance enhances the re-election chances of incumbents. However, disagreement persists regarding whether individuals in economically precarious situations are more inclined to cast economic votes. This paper contends that the degree of exposure to economic risks is a critical variable in elucidating individual-level variations in economic voting, as risk exposure influences the relevance of the economy in the voting process. In particular, emphasis is placed on job insecurity and employability as crucial drivers of economic voting patterns. The study hypothesizes that the extent of economic voting is higher among voters who are more susceptible to unemployment and have inadequate employment prospects in the event of job loss. These hypotheses are backed by evidence from a test using a dataset that merges survey data on incumbent support with occupational unemployment rates and other proxies of the exposure of voters to economic risks."
" The intersection of economic variables and electoral results has been extensively explored in political science literature. While there are areas of disagreement in economic voting research, the notion that macroeconomic performance is a critical factor in democratic elections has gained widespread acceptance among the general public and popular media. However, recent empirical and theoretical challenges in this field have emerged on two fronts. Firstly, studies have pointed out significant individual impediments to economic voting, such as the diverse ability and willingness of people to attain reliable knowledge about the economy. Secondly, the institutional environment of political behavior plays a vital role in determining the impact of economic performance on voting patterns, with political institutions significantly shaping voters' attitudes about holding incumbents responsible for macroeconomic outcomes."," Political science literature delves deep into the connection between economic factors and electoral results. Despite several areas of contention in economic voting research, there is a widespread belief that macroeconomic performance is a decisive factor in democratic elections among the general public and popular press. However, recent challenges have emerged in this field on empirical and theoretical fronts. Firstly, studies have highlighted that people face significant individual constraints to economic voting, such as their differences in information processing abilities and willingness to gather knowledge about the economy.

" This article contributes to the ongoing research in the economic voting field, particularly in identifying the role of individual-level differences in voting behavior. It combines insights from political science in exploring the factors that moderate the relationship between macroeconomic performance and the support for the incumbent. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of ""skills"" and professional job insecurity in shaping social policy preferences and welfare arrangements, yet their relevance in economic voting remains understudied. This article seeks to bridge this gap and reveal how professionals in vulnerable employment and those with specific skills react to shifts in macroeconomic conditions.

However, their relevance in the context of economic voting has remained largely unexplored, and this study aims to address this void. Moreover, this article offers new empirical evidence that links variations in macroeconomic performance to voters' labor market positions. It shows that while macroeconomic performance may be critical to specific professionals, it may not have the same impact on others, depending on their employment status."," This article aims to contribute to recent efforts in the economic voting literature and identify the individual-level differences in voting behavior.

This study seeks to fill this gap and shows that the impact of macroeconomic performance on individuals' voting behavior is more decisive among those employed in vulnerable professions or with specific skills. Additionally, the study provides fresh empirical evidence of how voters respond to changes in macroeconomic conditions based on their position in the labor market."

" Economic voting has been a subject of many studies, but some researchers have been hesitant to examine individual economic circumstances' impact on voting behavior. Many scholars view the economy as a 'valence issue,' assuming all voters prefer a good economy over a bad one. Therefore, most studies have focused on the attribution of responsibility, rather than the salience of economic performance. While previous research has established the groundwork for understanding individual economic conditions' role in shaping voting patterns, such as Hibbs (1977), many scholars have disregarded these findings in their research."," Economic voting has been extensively studied, yet few researchers have investigated how individual economic circumstances impact voting patterns. Many scholars consider the economy a 'valence issue,' assuming that all voters prefer a good economy over a bad one. As a result, much of the research has been focused on responsibility attribution, overlooking possible variations in economic performance's relevance. However, some classic studies, such as Hibbs (1977), have pioneered the theoretical grounds for comprehending how distinct groups within the electorate may differ in their receptiveness to macroeconomic signals, including inflation and unemployment. Despite the foundations laid by such studies, few scholars have analyzed the effect of individual economic experiences on voting behavior."," In the study of economic voting, researchers have generally overlooked the impact of individual economic circumstances on voting patterns. The economy is frequently referred to as a 'valence issue,' with all voters purportedly preferring a good economy over a bad one. Consequently, much of the research on economic voting has centered on the attribution of responsibility, with very little emphasis on the potential variation in the significance of economic performance across groups. However, some classic studies, such as Hibbs (1977), have attempted to conceptualize the role of individual economic conditions in shaping electoral decision-making. In particular, Hibbs found that responsiveness to macroeconomic performance signals like inflation and unemployment varies across groups within the electorate. Nevertheless, researchers have generally neglected to take these findings into account, overlooking how individual economic statuses might affect voting behavior."
" This article provides valuable insights into how an individual's labour market position plays a fundamental role in shaping their preferences for social insurance and voting behaviour. To further strengthen this argument, the article calls for the integration of research on economic voting and social policy preferences. It argues that disparities in risk exposure across different occupational groups lead to significant differences in voting behaviour at a macro level. The article also makes a significant contribution by presenting the first empirical study on this topic, using data on occupational unemployment, an important concept in the debate on social policy preferences and the welfare state's origins. Furthermore, the article uses a range of alternative measures to examine the robustness of its results against different operationalisation strategies."," The article brings important contributions to the debate by highlighting the pivotal role played by an individual's labour market position in shaping voting patterns and social policy preferences. The paper argues that there is a strong correlation between an individual's labour market status and their preference for social insurance. Disparities in risk exposure due to differences in labour market positions, in turn, generate significant differences in voting behaviour at a macro level. To support this argument, the article proposes integrating research on economic voting and social policy preferences. Additionally, the paper presents the first empirical test of this argument using occupational unemployment data, a central concept in the discussion on the welfare state's origins and social policy preferences. Finally, the article introduces several alternative measures of ""risk exposure"" to confirm the robustness of its results to different data sampling methodologies."," The article tackles the relationship between an individual's labour market status, their social policy preferences, and their voting behaviour. It asserts that an individual's position within the labour market is crucial in determining their favourability towards social insurance policies, as well as shaping their voting patterns. The article calls for an integration between research on economic voting and social policy preferences to further elucidate the topic. At a macro level, differences in risk exposure resulting from labour market status also create significant discrepancies in voting behaviour across occupational groups. The paper provides the first empirical test of this argument using data on occupational unemployment, which forms a fundamental element in the debate on social policy preferences and the origins of the welfare state. Additionally, the article offers alternative measures of ""risk exposure"" to assess the validity and robustness of its findings in the face of diverse operationalisation strategies."
" The discovery of these seminal articles necessitates a closer collaboration between the economic voting literature and the concepts of another widely known yet separate domain of political science. Research studies about the determinants of people's preferences for social policies have revealed that deep-seated inequalities exist in the distribution of economic risks among the electorate. These disparities breed differences not only in preferences for redistribution but also in the macro-level welfare state arrangements. Two types of individual-level factors determine the degree of exposure to the economic cycle that a voter has. One school of thought suggests that the specificity of professional abilities, acquired through education and work experience, positively correlates with risk exposure. Those with non-transferable skills are more likely to suffer prolonged unemployment after losing a job. Another perspective suggests that the main driver behind risk exposure is job insecurity, not employability. Additionally, industry association plays a crucial role in shaping job security through a variety of channels."," The findings of these ground-breaking articles emphasize the need for a closer integration between the economic voting literature and the insights from another distinct yet reputable field of political science. Scholarly investigations into the determinants of social policy preferences have yielded ample evidence indicating substantial inequalities in the distribution of economic risks within the electorate. Such inequalities contribute to differences in attitudes towards redistribution, and also in the larger welfare state arrangements at the macro level. There are two main categories of individual-level factors that determine a person's exposure to the economic cycle. One viewpoint holds that the specificity of professional skills attained through education and professional development is positively related to risk exposure. Workers with non-transferable skills are more susceptible to long-term unemployment in the event of a job loss. Another perspective posits that risk exposure depends on job insecurity rather than employability, with industry affiliation playing a significant role in job security through various channels."," These pivotal articles' discoveries call for a closer integration between the economic voting literature and the principles of another distinct yet renowned branch of political science. Researchers have conducted scholarly studies into the determinants of social policy preferences, which have provided substantial evidence of significant inequalities in the distribution of economic risks among the electorate. Such inequalities contribute to differences in preferences for redistribution and in the macro-level welfare state arrangements. The degree of exposure to the economic cycle is determined by two types of individual-level factors. According to one perspective, the specificity of professional skills acquired through education and professionalization is directly proportional to the degree of risk exposure. As a result, employees with non-transferable skills are more vulnerable to enduring unemployment in case of job loss. From another perspective, job insecurity, rather than employability, is the primary factor that determines risk exposure, while industry membership shapes job security through different channels."
" In the economic voting model, the key principles suggest that voters may have two main rationales for being interested in the state of the macroeconomic environment. Firstly, voters may perceive economic prosperity as an intrinsic virtue, and therefore, economic voting may align with a 'sociotropic' trend where voters back incumbents only if they have promoted the general welfare of the country (Kinder & Kiewiet 1981). Secondly, the state of economic performance is also viewed as important since future monetary outcomes of individual voters depend, to some extent, on the overall fiscal health of the nation. However, in this argument, it is critical to assume that, to some extent, economic voting may be prompted by 'pocketbook' concerns regarding the individual repercussions of economic performance. Without voters caring about how aggregate economic activity impacts their own financial situation, economic exposure to risk would not be a significant factor in economic voting."," According to the economic voting model, the fundamental principles suggest that voters may have two primary reasons for being interested in the prevailing macroeconomic situation. Firstly, some voters may view economic prosperity as an end in and of itself, and thus, economic voting may follow a 'sociotropic' tendency where voters lend their support to incumbents only if they have advanced the general welfare of the country (Kinder & Kiewiet 1981). Secondly, the state of economic performance is also deemed significant since future financial outcomes of individual voters rely, at least partly, on the fiscal health of the nation. However, it is crucial to assume that, to some degree, economic voting may be prompted by 'pocketbook' concerns regarding how the macroeconomic state may impact the individual finances of voters. Without voters being concerned about how aggregate economic performance affects their personal financial state, susceptibility to economic risk would not be a key factor in economic voting."," The economic voting model proposes that there are two primary reasons why voters may be interested in the macroeconomic climate. First, some voters may consider the prosperity of the economy as a goal in itself, and thus, their voting pattern may align with a 'sociotropic' tendency where they support incumbents only if they have improved the overall material well-being of the country (Kinder & Kiewiet 1981). Second, economic performance affects not just the nation as a whole but also the future financial outcomes of individual voters. Therefore, for this argument, it is vital to assume that some economic voting is motivated by 'pocketbook' anxieties regarding the effect of economic performance on the individual finances of voters. If voters did not care about how aggregate economic performance affects their personal financial situation, economic risk would not be a crucial factor in economic voting."
" The reason for this phenomenon requires examination of a factor that has not been given enough attention in economic voting literature - the significance of the economy and how it fluctuates across different electorates. This article establishes two key assumptions regarding the connection between economic significance and voting behavior. Firstly, it is assumed that voters have limited ability to receive and process information regarding specific political issues. This is consistent with the concept of 'bounded rationality,' originally established by Herbert Simon. Secondly, voters are more likely to evaluate candidates based on their performance in policy areas that they consider to be of greater importance to them. This means that most voters do not assess candidates based on their performance in all policy areas but only on specific areas of interest. This insight is valuable for understanding economic voting because, though voters may prefer a competent economic manager to a substandard one, some may prioritize other qualities of the candidate over economic competence."," To comprehend why this phenomenon occurs, it is necessary to examine an often-overlooked factor in studies of economic voting: the prominence of economic concerns and how they vary across different groups of voters. This article is founded on two fundamental assumptions concerning the link between the salience of the economy and voting behavior. Firstly, the article posits that voters have significant cognitive limitations when it comes to receiving and processing information about specific political issues. This concept of ""bounded rationality"" was first explored by Herbert Simon and is supported by subsequent empirical research in behavioral economics and social psychology. Secondly, voters tend to evaluate candidates based on their performance in policy areas that they deem most important to them, rather than in every policy area. This means that most voters do not assess candidates solely on their economic performance, but rather on other issues that are of greater concern to them. This insight is vital to understanding economic voting because, while voters may prefer candidates who are strong economic managers, other factors may be more important to them when casting their vote."," To understand the reason behind this occurrence, we need to consider a factor that has not received adequate attention in the literature on economic voting - the level of importance attached to the economy and its variation across different groups of voters. This article makes two critical assumptions regarding the link between the salience of the economy and voting behaviour. Firstly, it assumes cognitive limitations in the way voters receive and process information related to political issues, which is known as ""bounded rationality."" This has been explored extensively by Herbert Simon and supported by empirical research in behavioural economics and social psychology. Secondly, voters evaluate candidates based on their performance in policy areas that they perceive to be of particular interest or concern to them. Most voters do not assess all candidates based on their economic policy, and may instead focus on other issues that are of more importance to them. This understanding is significant for economic voting because, even though candidates with a strong economic performance may be preferred by a majority of voters, the importance of other attributes may vary for different individuals."
" The understanding of how macroeconomic performance affects voting behavior has become more refined through recent developments in economic voting literature. Though economic voting's importance is acknowledged in most recent research, differences are apparent, both across individuals and countries. Individual-level characteristics, such as responsibility attribution, also shape cognitive processes involved in economic voting. However, it is crucial to understand the role of social policy preferences and welfare state development in economic voting, which has been understudied. This article proposes dividing voters by their vulnerability to economic fluctuations, leading to a more profound comprehension of economic voting. The study found that voters susceptible to job insecurity are more likely to support incumbent governments if they deliver good economic indicators."," Economic voting literature has undergone significant changes that help improve our understanding of the connection between macroeconomic performance and voting behavior. While most recent studies recognize the relevance of economic voting, there are differences across individuals and countries. Studies have largely focused on responsibility attribution and individual-level characteristics that affect cognitive processes related to economic voting. However, this article emphasizes an understudied aspect of economic voting- social policy preferences and welfare state development. The author proposes dividing voters into categories based on their vulnerability to economic fluctuations to decipher how economic voting works. Results suggest that voters with higher levels of job insecurity are more likely to show support for incumbent governments who deliver good macroeconomic outcomes."," Recent developments in economic voting literature have contributed significantly to improve our understanding of the relationship between macroeconomic performance and voting behavior.

However, this article argues that social policy preferences and welfare state development have been largely overlooked in the realm of economic voting. The author promotes assigning voters into categories based on their exposure to economic fluctuations, leading to a better assessment of economic voting.

" This study reports some encouraging findings, although there are significant limitations in the research design adopted that should be taken into account. These limitations, however, provide the groundwork for further investigations into the interplay between economic risk and economic voting. One such limitation is that the response variable used in this study measures public opinions rather than actual voting behavior. Testing the argument with actual voting data could substantiate these findings further. Another limitation is the small number of clusters in the sample, which could lead to limitations in the estimation of standard errors for macro-level variables. Furthermore, the interaction between cluster-level covariates could be better explored with a larger sample size. In addition, this article ascertains that the campaign-specific dynamic and political communication strategies are crucial in determining the significance of the economy in electoral contests. This study did not test the causal mechanism postulated, which could also be explored in future research."," The findings of this study are positive, but the design limitations should be taken into account when interpreting the results, and research on the relationship between economic voting and risk should continue in the future. A primary limitation is that the response variable used in this study is a measure of public opinion rather than actual voting behavior, which may lead to discrepancies between voting intentions and actual voting behavior. In addition, this study focuses on a small group of advanced economies, which could contribute to inaccurate standard error estimations for macro-level variables. Therefore, including a larger number of clusters in the sample could help to address this issue. Additionally, interaction effects between cluster-level covariates could be more thoroughly investigated with a larger sample size, and campaign-specific dynamics and political communication strategies should be taken into account to help determine the significance of the economy in electoral contests. Finally, future studies should test the causal mechanisms underlying the findings, as this study does not examine this aspect."," While the results of this study are positive, it is important to consider the limitations of its design, and there is still more research to be done on the relationship between economic risk and economic voting. One limitation of this study is that the response variable used measures public opinion rather than actual voting behavior, and this could lead to discrepancies between predicted voting behavior and actual voting behavior. Additionally, the study focuses only on a small group of advanced economies, and including more clusters in the sample could help address potential estimation errors for macro-level variables. Moreover, interaction effects between cluster-level covariates could be more thoroughly examined, and the distinctiveness of campaign-specific dynamics and political communication strategies should be examined to determine the economy's significance in electoral competition. Finally, the study does not explore the causal mechanism behind its findings, and future research should strive to do so."
" In Figure 3, a visual representation is presented that exhibits the difference between the two groups by utilizing two separate curves that predict the probabilities of incumbent support based on GDP growth. The solid curve represents the low-skill respondents, and the dashed curved represents the high-skill respondents. The chart suggests that macroeconomic fluctuations have a more significant impact on the incumbent's support among low-skill respondents. For instance, during a bad economic situation of -1% growth, the predicted probability of incumbent support would decrease by 0.21 (from 0.45 to 0.24) for the low-skill group, while it would reduce to 0.08 (from 0.39 to 0.31) for the high-skill group. Moreover, the chart indicates that the variation is more apparent during economic crises than economic booms, which may indicate that both groups differ more in their inclination to punish incumbents for poor economic performance than their readiness to reward them for good performance."," The difference between the two groups is presented in Figure 3, which shows two curves that predict the probabilities of incumbent support based on GDP growth.

" The third, fourth, and fifth models examine distinct components of job insecurity to estimate the model in Equation 3. Model 3 employs a dummy variable for unemployed respondents and macroeconomic growth to understand the effect of unemployment on economic conditions. We would expect to see a positive coefficient for the interaction term as unemployed respondents are particularly vulnerable to economic uncertainty. However, the regression models show that the coefficient is not statistically significant at the 0.05 level in either the simple logistic or random effect models. Model 4 focuses on employment in the public sector as an indicator of job security. Unexpectedly, the coefficient is positively signed and of modest magnitude, suggesting that there is no discernible difference in economic voting patterns between respondents employed in the public sector and those employed in the private sector. Additionally, the significance of public sector employment is highly dependent on model specification, as it is almost significant in the random effect model and insignificant in the simple regression model. Finally, models 5 and 5r reveal that union membership is a crucial factor in influencing economic voting behaviour."," The third, fourth, and fifth models employ alternative methods to evaluate job insecurity in terms of the model in Equation 3. In model 3, macroeconomic growth is combined with a dummy variable to measure the impact of unemployment on economic conditions.

Despite this, the results from the regression models showed that this coefficient is not statistically significant at the 0.05 level in either the simple logistic regression or random effect model. Model 4 explores whether public sector employment provides job security, with the results demonstrating that the coefficient is positively signed and of modest magnitude, contrary to expectations. The significance of public sector employment is also highly dependent on the model specification, as it is almost significant in the random effect model and insignificant in the simple regression model. Finally, estimations for models 5 and 5r reveal that union membership is a critical driver of economic voting behaviour."," The third, fourth, and fifth models employ different measures to assess job insecurity within the framework of the model outlined in Equation 3.

Model 4 investigates the role of public sector employment in determining job security, but the findings suggest that the effect of public sector employment is practically insignificant, and there is no noticeable difference in economic voting patterns between public and private sector employees. The coefficient associated with public sector employment results in a small, positive sign, which is contrary to the anticipated effects. Finally, models 5 and 5r present empirical evidence that union membership is an essential predictor of economic voting behaviour."
" This paper is an analysis of Hungary's transformation process from 1989 to 2004, with a focus on evaluating its effectiveness. The paper is structured to reflect this aim, with the first section exploring the economic development of the country prior to the fall of the communist regime. Political developments are also touched upon, as they had a profound impact on the transformation process and its outcomes. The main steps in economic transformation are discussed in detail, with special attention given to the issue of privatization. Finally, the paper concludes by examining the key economic indicators of this period. The findings suggest that while the transformation process achieved its main economic objectives and led to an increase in the economy's growth potential, it also paved the way for future economic challenges that were yet to come."," In this paper, the transformation process in Hungary between 1989 and 2004 is analyzed and evaluated. The primary objective of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of the transformation process in Hungary. The composition of the paper reflects this objective, with a detailed analysis of Hungary's pre-transformation economic development being the first order of business. Political developments that played a significant role in the transformation process and its outcomes are also briefly discussed. Special attention is paid to the main steps taken in carrying out the economic transformation process, with a particular focus on privatization. In the final section, the paper analyzes the primary economic indicators during this period. The findings indicate that while the transformation process achieved its primary economic goal and led to a growth in the economy, it also set a foundation for subsequent economic problems that would have to be addressed."," This paper evaluates the transformation process that took place in Hungary between 1989 and 2004.

The impact of political developments on the transformation process and its consequences is also considered. Next, the paper explores the key steps implemented during the economic transformation process, with a concentration on the privatization process. Finally, the paper concludes by analyzing the significant economic indicators of the period. The results suggest that while the primary objectives of the transformation process were met, economic challenges remained prevalent due to previous policy decisions."
" The objective of this paper is to examine and assess the transformation process that took place in Hungary. The author contends that the primary goal of the transformation process was a paradigm shift in the economy from being centrally planned to embracing a market-oriented framework. In our opinion, this goal was mostly achieved after Hungary became a member of the European Union, and therefore our analysis is restricted to the period ending in 2004. This period serves as indirect evidence that Hungary had successfully established a viable market economy, as it was a mandatory requirement for EU membership. However, it is important to question how this was achieved, as several other countries undergoing transformation have yet to achieve the same level of success. The second objective of the transformation process was to change the overall pattern of economic development, with a specific focus on increasing economic growth. The centrally planned economy was on the verge of collapse, thereby causing economic growth to decline, leading to stagnation in the 1980s. Consequently, Hungary was lagging behind market economies. Without any growth enhancements, any changes made in the economy would have no significance. The paper, therefore, endeavors to evaluate Hungary's transformation process's progress, focusing on this goal."," The purpose of this paper is to examine and evaluate how the transformation process unfolded in Hungary. The author's view is that the central goal of this transformation was to move from a centrally-planned economic system to a market-oriented one. From our standpoint, this objective was largely met during Hungary's accession into the European Union; hence our analysis is limited to the timeframe up to 2004. The fact that Hungary met the EU's requirement of having a functioning market economy is indirect proof that the country had managed to establish such a system. It is worth noting, however, that several other countries undergoing transformation are yet to attain such a state, with Belarus being a prime example. Therefore, it is pertinent to question how Hungary managed to achieve this goal. The transformation process's second objective was to shift the overall trend of economic development, with a more specific focus on enhancing economic growth. The centrally-planned economic system was on an inevitable path of collapsing, which resulted in a significant decline in economic growth and stagnation in the 1980s. This made Hungary fall behind other market economies. A change of the economic pattern without enhancing its growth capability would have been pointless. This paper seeks to evaluate the progress of the transformation process from this perspective."," The main objective of this paper is to analyze and assess the transformation process that Hungary underwent. According to the author, the primary goal of this transformation was to make a transition from a centrally planned economic system to a market-oriented structure. We believe that this objective was mostly achieved upon Hungary's accession into the European Union, and that is why we are limiting our analysis to the period before 2004. The accession into the EU is seen as indirect evidence that Hungary had achieved a functional market economy, which was a vital requirement for EU membership. However, it is essential to understand how Hungary was able to accomplish this transformation goal, given that other countries in transition are still struggling to implement the same transition successfully. The second objective of the transformation process was to shift the overall trend of economic development with a specific focus on enhancing economic growth. The centrally-planned economic system was bound to fail, which led to a significant decline in economic growth, causing stagnation in the country in the 1980s. Consequently, Hungary was trailing behind other market economies. Any change in the economic structure without boosting growth would have been futile. This paper aims to evaluate the progress that Hungary made in achieving this specific objective."
" Our discussion will first delve into the political developments that occurred over the long-term in Hungary, focusing on how this impacted the state of the Hungarian economy in the late 80s. This analysis will form the basis of our second chapter. A significant portion of our study will then look into the political changes in Hungary during the period between 1990 and 2004, leading up to its accession to the EU. We believe that Hungary's entry into the EU is a testament to the country's economic condition. The successive three chapters of our study will go over the primary economic developments in detail. These will include an examination of the sequence of reforms and a stand-alone chapter discussing the privatization initiatives. The final chapter of our study will summarize the economic achievements during the studied period. We will analyze economic growth, the structure of the economy, inflation, unemployment, and external relationships in specific subchapters."," Our investigation will commence with an overview of the long-term political precedence in Hungary, the effects of which were felt in the Hungarian economy towards the end of the 1980s. The examination of such effects is allocated to the second chapter. The following section will primarily focus on the political advancements during the transformation period spanning from 1990 to 2004 (i.e., accession to the EU). We firmly believe that the accession to the EU signifies the economic situation of Hungary. The central economic developments will be discussed in the next three chapters, emphasizing the sequence of changes first and foremost, thereafter emphasizing the privatization development. The two chapters will act as a breakdown of the key economic factors. In the final chapter, the results of the studied period will be summarized with explicit subchapters scrutinizing economic growth, the outline of the economy, inflation, unemployment, and international relationships."," The assessment will initiate with a description of Hungary's political evolution over the long-term, which had an impact on the state of the Hungarian economy in the late 1980s. This critical analysis is going to be presented in Chapter two. The focal point of our study is going to be on the political advancements during the transformation period, which spans between 1990 and 2004, leading up to the country's adherence to the European Union. We believe that Hungary's acceptance into the EU can be interpreted as proof of the country's wholesome economy. The primary economic development will be examined in the following three chapters. Firstly, we will concentrate on the sequence of changes, followed by a standalone chapter on the development of privatization. These two chapters will discuss the most pertinent economic procedures. Finally, in the last chapter, we will summarize the economic final outcomes during the studied period. Specific subchapters will scrutinize economic growth, the structural framework of the economy, inflation, unemployment, and external relationships."
" Throughout the course of our work on the project, data proved to be a major hurdle for us. We encountered difficulties with the length of consistent data series, as it was extremely challenging to find appropriate and uniform data that covered the entire period of transformation. Consequently, we had to rely on shorter data series. However, we made sure that the data we used were the best possible options available to us."," While working on the project, we faced several challenges when it came to the data we were using. We encountered problems with the length of consistent data series because it was difficult to locate data that were relevant and consistent across the entire transformation period. Consequently, we had to rely on shorter data series. However, we believe that the data we utilized were the most suitable options available to us."," Our work on the paper was accompanied by multiple issues linked with the data we were analyzing. The main difficulty lied in the length of consistent data series as we struggled to find data that covered the whole period of transformation, relevant for our analysis and homogenous.

" The focal point of this text is on the economic transformation that took place in Hungary, yet the country's rich history demands a more comprehensive perspective. The First World War had a severe effect on Hungary. As a consequence, it had to surrender a sizeable part of its territory to the succeeding states of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Also, a considerable number of Hungarian minorities ended up living in the contiguous countries, including Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia, to which Hungary reacted with strong disapproval. The government's primary concern during the interwar years was to bring together all of the Hungarians into a single state, attempting to recreate the concept of ""Greater Hungary."" Consequently, the nation decided to partner with fascist Germany in the 1930s towards achieving this goal, which saw Hungary practically align itself with Germany during World War II."," This text delves into the transformation process Hungary underwent economically; however, a more comprehensive understanding of Hungary's history is needed. The aftermath of the First World War deeply affected Hungary, with a substantial chunk of its land being ceded to neighbouring states. The Hungarian minority found themselves living in countries like Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania, which Hungary saw as deeply unjust. The key objective during the interwar period was to reunite all Hungarians in a single state, which led Hungary to look towards fascist Germany for support in the 1930s. By forming a coalition with Germany, Hungary hoped it could achieve the objective of rebuilding ""Greater Hungary."" Ultimately, this alliance led Hungary to be Germany's ally during the Second World War."," The central focus of this text is on Hungary's economic development during its transformation process. However, to comprehend Hungary's intricate history, a comprehensive outlook is essential. The aftermath of the First World War had far-reaching implications for Hungary, where it lost a significant portion of its land to neighbouring countries that had emerged after the Austro-Hungarian Empire's collapse. The Hungarians perceived this as a considerable injustice, and the government's primary goal during the interwar years was to bring all Hungarians together into a single state, a concept known as ""Greater Hungary."" To fulfil this objective, Hungary turned to fascist Germany for support in the 1930s, becoming Germany's ally during World War II. This partnership had significant consequences, resulting in a devastating impact on Hungary's economy and its people."
" Hungary witnessed an easing of political tensions during the 1980s, which eventually resulted in the formation of an opposition movement. The round table negotiations took place in 1989 and led to a significant constitutional change that guaranteed the country's transition to democracy, market economy, human rights, and barred the establishment of a single-party government. The endorsement of this change on October 23, 1989, marked the commencement of a new era for Hungary as a democratic state. They did not waste time, and straight away held democratic elections in March 1990, avoiding any form of pseudo-democracy or national unity government."," Throughout the 1980s, political tensions in Hungary began to ease, leading to the emergence of an opposition movement in the mid-80s. As a result, the round table negotiations were conducted in 1989, and the outcome of the talks was historic. A constitutional amendment was passed, promising a transition of power to a democracy, a market economy, the promotion of human rights, and an end to single-party governance. This amendment was ratified on October 23, 1989, and marked the beginning of a new democratic era in Hungary. Instead of establishing a national unity government, the country's first democratic elections were held in March 1990, thus avoiding any false impression of democracy."," Hungary experienced a period of political d¨¦tente throughout the 1980s, which gave rise to the opposition's formation in the mid-80s. Round table discussions were held in 1989, culminating in a constitutional shift that entailed a shift to democracy, the promotion of human rights, a market economy, and the expulsion of a single-party government, even if it had a legislative majority. This alteration was confirmed on October 23, 1989, and marked the inception of the modern democratic era for Hungary. Instead of availing themselves of a pseudo-democracy or a government of national unity, the country held fair and free elections in March 1990 to mark the transition."
" The Hungarian economy was impacted by several factors over time, including political developments. The country's centrally planned system was established after World War II, and although it differed from others in the region, its backbone remained the same. While the system in Hungary differed from the one in Czechoslovakia, it did not remain the same over time, as the introduction of reforms after 1968 led to significant differences between the two. These changes, however, did not only impact the economy but had broader implications for the country's social and cultural fabric."," Hungary's economy was significantly influenced by the political climate during its period of transition. Following World War II, the country adopted a centrally planned system, with some variations from other countries in the region. Though the Hungarian system was less rigid than Czechoslovakia's, reforms introduced in 1968 led to substantial differences between the two systems. These changes motivated Hungary to explore new economic models, and the country underwent significant economic transformation, including its transition to a market economy. However, political tensions and struggles over economic reform persisted throughout the process, highlighting the importance of political developments for economic stability."," Political events had a profound impact on the direction and evolution of the Hungarian economy through much of the 20th century. Following World War II, Hungary implemented a centrally planned economic system with some unique features compared to other countries in the region. This system was less rigid than the one in Czechoslovakia, but a wave of reforms in the late 1960s led to significant divergence between the two countries. The economic transformation that occurred during this period was complex and multifaceted, and some argued that it was impossible to achieve without broad-reaching political reform. Despite this, the path of Hungary's economic progression remained closely entwined with the country's political landscape, with tensions and uncertainty emerging as Hungary navigated its way toward a new economic model."
" The implementation of a value added tax system in Hungary commenced in 1988, pioneering as the first country in the Central European region. Liberalization of 63% of all prices had already happened in 1989. The forint currency had seen continuous devaluation from 45.8 to USD in 1986 to 63.2 in 1990 (Vintrov¨¢, 1992)."," In 1988, Hungary adopted a value added tax system and became the first country in Central Europe to do so. Within a year, 63% of all prices were liberalized. Over the next few years, the forint underwent persistent devaluations, with the exchange rate dropping to 63.2 in 1990 from 45.8 to USD in 1986 (Vintrov¨¢, 1992)."," Hungary introduced value added tax into its tax system in 1988, taking the lead as the first country in Central Europe to do so. As of 1989, almost two-thirds of prices had been liberalized. However, the forint currency was subjected to numerous devaluations during this period, falling from 45.8 to USD in 1986 to 63.2 by 1990 (Vintrov¨¢, 1992)."
" In the late 20th century, Hungary underwent a significant change in its economic environment. According to Bethkenhagen in 1989, the private sector had only accounted for 3% of the nation's total production in 1970. By 1989, more than a quarter of the country's production had come from the private sector, with two-thirds of the Hungarian workforce earning a supplementary income through private activity while holding their full-time state company or cooperative jobs. Although these figures were notably higher than those of Czechoslovakia, they still did not reflect a fully functioning market economy."," Hungary in the 1980s experienced a significant shift in their economy, where the private sector only accounted for 3% of the national product in 1970, but by 1989, that number had increased to over a quarter, as stated by Holman. Additionally, approximately two-thirds of the Hungarian population had an enhanced income from participating in private activities alongside their primary employment with state companies or cooperatives. Despite Hungary surpassing Czechoslovakia's economy, this hardly reflected a market-oriented economy."," When examining Hungary's economy, it is evident that significant changes occurred in the late 20th century. Bethkenhagen reported in 1989 that the private sector had only contributed 3% of the national product in 1970. In contrast, the private sector had already amassed over a quarter of the national product by 1989 as per Holman. Furthermore, two-thirds of Hungarians received supplementary income through participating in private activities while employed by state companies or cooperatives. While Hungary had outperformed Czechoslovakia's economy, it still wasn't representative of a genuinely market-oriented economy."
" The economy of Hungary witnessed significant fluctuations during the communist regime, which were not as pronounced in Czechoslovakia. Though the 1950s saw a commendable economic growth, subsequent decades proved to be challenging with low growth rates during the 1980s. Despite implementing economic reforms, there was no corresponding improvement in the growth trend. On the contrary, there was a decline in economic performance. A visual representation of this trend is clearly evident in a figure in the text."," During the communist regime in Hungary, the economy experienced great fluctuations in growth, which were more significant than those in Czechoslovakia.

" The initial democratic elections took place in the spring of 1990, where a government led by Jozsef Antall (1932-1993) was formed. The government was a mixture of Christian and national parties that leaned towards the political center-right. With a strong parliamentary majority of 60%, the government had a firm grip on power, providing a stable position for Hungary. One of the government's significant accomplishments was the Soviet troops' withdrawal from Hungary in the middle of 1991.

" Following the 1994 elections, the MSZP political party, which had roots in post-communism, emerged victorious by a significant margin. However, the economic issues facing the country forced the party to enforce severe economic policies. The 1998 elections led to the establishment of a right wing coalition, with Fidesz as the primary party. During this period, Hungary joined NATO. Although Fidesz won the next election in 2002, it was not able to form a government with left wing parties taking control instead."," In 1994, the MSZP, a left-leaning party that had descended from the communist party, won the elections in a landslide victory. Nevertheless, the country's difficult economic state pushed them to put in place stringent economic measures. The 1998 elections saw the formation of a right-wing coalition government with Fidesz leading as the primary party. During this government's regime, Hungary became a member of NATO. Despite Fidesz winning again in 2002, they were unable to establish a government, leading to left wing parties forming the government instead."," Hungary's 1994 election saw the MSZP, a left-leaning party with communist roots, win by a significant margin.

While Fidesz won the 2002 elections, they were unable to assemble a government and left-wing parties took charge."
" Hungary adhered to democratic values throughout the given time period and was accepted into the European Union by 2004. However, consistent dissatisfaction with the nation's transformation process and standard of living has been reported. A 2006 survey indicates significant levels of discontent, but a definitive reason for it is difficult to pinpoint. One possible explanation is that Hungarians had great hopes and optimistic outlooks about the future during the 1980s, and they were quite content with the semi-capitalist system of goulash communism."," Hungary upheld democratic principles for the entirety of the given period and was granted membership to the European Union in 2004. Despite this, a persistent level of dissatisfaction has been noted with the nation's transformation process and overall quality of life. The findings of a survey conducted in 2006 illustrate this dissatisfaction, but the exact factors driving it remain unclear. It is possible that Hungarians held high expectations for their nation in the late 1980s and were content with the partial capitalist system of goulash communism."," During the specified period, Hungary's adherence to democratic values was evident, and it became a member of the European Union in 2004.

" During the period of transformation, the sequence of reforms in Hungary was a topic of discussion, similar to other countries. Nevertheless, what made Hungary unique was the fact that the communist party had already started reforms before the regime's fall. As a result, Hungarians believed they could achieve the same results with slower reforms, which were more cost-effective compared to radical reforms. However, proponents of a shock therapy approach did not have faith in the government's abilities to establish a market economy. Hence, the initial period of the Hungarian transformation is often referred to as gradualist, yet there are continual debates over the definition of gradualism. Some of the Hungarian measures introduced, such as the bankruptcy law, were extremely radical. The second subchapter of this study investigates the reforms implemented in the mid-1990s, whilst the third subchapter focuses on the period post- the turn of the century."," Hungary faced similar questions regarding the sequence of reforms in other countries at the beginning of its transformation period. However, the communist party in Hungary had already initiated reforms even before the end of the regime. Because of this, most Hungarians believed that a gradual reform process would suffice, and that it was not necessary to resort to radical reforms. Supporters of a shock therapy approach thought otherwise, however, and doubted the government's ability to establish a market economy. The first period of Hungarian transformation is often described as gradualist, though its definition remains a subject of debate. Some measures introduced by Hungary, such as the bankruptcy law, were extremely radical. The second part of this work looks into the reforms of the mid-1990s, while the third focuses on the post-millennial period."," At the start of the transformation period, the sequence of reforms in Hungary was being discussed in the same way as in other countries. What made Hungary distinct was that its communist party had already begun implementing reforms before the regime's fall. This led to the belief that slower reforms could produce the same outcomes at lower costs than radical reforms, which was accepted by many Hungarians. However, those who advocated for a shock therapy approach didn't trust the government's ability to establish a market economy. As a result, the first stage of transformation in Hungary is frequently labelled as gradualist, although there's disagreement over its definition. Specific Hungarian initiatives, such as the bankruptcy law, can be thought of as extremely radical. The second sub-chapter examines the changes that occurred in the mid-1990s, while the third looks at the period after the turn of the millennium."
" Hungary's economy faced macroeconomic imbalances, as highlighted earlier. The Antall government had three primary objectives, as mentioned by Laki (1993), which were to maintain the country's creditworthiness, decrease inflation and mitigate the growing public deficit. However, the most challenging of these tasks was managing the public deficit due to reduced state income after the collapse of the communist regime. Although the government tried to reduce expenditures, they expanded the state's responsibilities by taking over late state companies that provided social services, leading to further spending increases (Allen, Hass, 2001)."," The Hungarian economy faced macroeconomic imbalances as stated earlier, which led to the Antall government's three primary objectives, according to Laki (1993). These objectives were to maintain the country's creditworthiness, decrease inflation, and combat the growing public deficit. However, reducing the public deficit was the most intricate task since the fall of the communist regime led to a decline in state income. Struggling to decrease expenditures, the government took on the responsibility of late state companies providing social services to the general population, resulting in increased spending (Allen, Hass, 2001)."," As previously mentioned, the Hungarian economy struggled with macroeconomic imbalances leading to the Antall government's three primary objectives, outlined by Laki (1993).

However, reducing the public deficit was an uphill task for the government as the fall of the communist regime led to a decrease in state income. Despite their attempts to decrease government expenditures, the government struggled as they took over the responsibilities of late state companies providing social services. This, in turn, led to further spending increases (Allen, Hass, 2001)."
" The Hungarian government undertook simultaneous reforms in both the business and financial sectors, alongside measures aimed at improving the legal system, enforcing antitrust policies, and emphasizing bankruptcy. The implementation of a tough new bankruptcy code in 1992 was a deviation from Hungary's gradualism tradition, leading to bankruptcy filing by 5,000 entities, which accounted for about 10% of the country's GDP. In addition, the bankruptcy proceeding served as a mechanism for privatization, and many large companies were transferred into private ownership. Unfortunately, the process had an unintended consequence for banks who faced increasing classified credits. By comparison, the Czech Republic's bankruptcy legislation remained relatively weak during the same period, with the first law approved in 1993, and it couldn't be applied to companies waiting for privatization."," The Hungarian government extended changes to both its business and finance sector while working to improve the legal system, such as the enforcement of antitrust laws and prioritizing bankruptcy issues. The quick implementation of a rigorous bankruptcy code in 1992 disrupted Hungary's gradualism approach, leading to 5,000 subjects filing for bankruptcy - these subjects accounted for nearly 10% of Hungary's GDP. Moreover, privatization was a side-effect of the bankruptcy proceeding, with around 500 large companies being transferred into private ownership. Unfortunately, as the number of classified credits grew, the banking industry was also negatively affected by the reform process. In comparison, the Czech Republic's weak bankruptcy legislation - which had not been applied against companies waiting to be privatized - was only introduced in 1993."," The Hungarian government adopted reforms in both the business and financial sectors, aiming to upgrade its legal system, enforce antitrust policies, and treat bankruptcy as a priority. The implementation of a tough new bankruptcy code in 1992 marked a departure from Hungary's gradualism principle, which saw 5,000 subjects file for bankruptcy, creating a dent in the country's GDP. Moreover, the bankruptcy proceedings contributed to privatization, with around 500 large companies being transferred into private ownership. Unfortunately, this had a detrimental effect on the banking sector as the escalation of classified credits impaired their functioning. At the same time, the Czech Republic's bankruptcy law remained weak throughout the same duration, with the very first law approved only in 1993, with no authority over businesses awaiting privatization."
" Hungary's economy showed negative results during the period in question. Although Hungary attempted gradual reform, this policy failed to prevent a transformation recession. The country experienced a decline that was comparable to or possibly greater than that of other Central European nations, resulting in a high unemployment rate. In contrast to other nations, inflation did not exhibit a sudden increase after price liberalization but remained persistently high. Despite this, the country saw a relatively significant influx of foreign capital. The foreign investment was due to the prior liberalization making Hungary an attractive destination for foreign investors. However, Hungary also faced a current account deficit during this period."," Hungary's economic performance during this period was lackluster. Despite its attempts at implementing a gradual reform policy, Hungary found itself unable to avoid a transformation recession. Hungary experienced a decline that was equal to or greater than other Central European countries, bringing about a high unemployment rate.

" The government's goal with the steps they took was to bring down the deficits of public finance and trade balance and boost competitiveness in the economy. Unfortunately, the measures had a significant impact, with government expenditure dropping by 10% of GDP, and real wages decreasing by 12% in 1995 and 4% in 1996. In turn, economic growth slowed down to 1% in both 1995 and 1996. Nonetheless, the trade deficit reduced between 1994 and 1996, and the government deficit, excluding privatization income, decreased from 8.4% to 3%. The average deficit from 1990 to 2004 was 5.5% of GDP, which was quite high among the Central European countries. The overall development of public finance in the first decade is represented in the following graph."," The main aim of the government's actions was to decrease the public finance and trade deficit and to promote competition in the economy.

" Following the implementation of the Bokros package, there were several positive developments in Hungary's economy. However, the period of growth was only temporary, and the country faced significant challenges in the early 2000s. One of Hungary's most notable fiscal issues was the government's decision to increase public sector wages by 12-13% in 2002. This increase, among other government expenditures, led to a growing budget deficit that is visible in the chart presented. The trade deficit was another source of instability, reaching between 6-8% of GDP at the turn of the century. While the global economic slowdown played a role, a decline in competitiveness due to excessive wage growth was the primary driver of the trade deficit."," The Bokros package brought about positive changes in the economy of Hungary. However, this growth period was short-lived, and the country faced several challenges in the early 2000s. One significant issue was the government's increasing spending, particularly on public sector wages, which rose by 12-13% in 2002. The chart shows a growing budget deficit, which can be attributed to government expenditures, among other things. The trade deficit was also a matter of concern, reaching levels of 6-8% of GDP at the beginning of the new century. The slowdown of the European economies was partially responsible for this decline, but much of it was due to the country's decreasing competitiveness, which resulted from wage growth. Gabrisch and H?lscher (2006) corroborated this viewpoint."," In the wake of the implementation of the Bokros package, Hungary's economy experienced a positive upswing. Nevertheless, this success proved to be ephemeral as the country encountered severe challenges at the start of the new millennium. A prominent issue was the government's expense in the public sector, which saw a rise of 12-13% in 2002. This wage hike, among other expenditures, contributed to a growing budget deficit as exhibited in the chart. The country's trade deficit was also a problem, soaring to between 6-8% of GDP in the early 2000s. Although the European economy's slowdown had some impact, it was mostly due to the country's loss of competitiveness that resulted from the escalation of wages. According to Gabrisch and H?lscher (2006), this was the case."
" In response to sustained inflation pressures, the central bank took measures to curb it by implementing monetary restrictions in May 2001. This included expanding the variance band from ¡À2.25 to ¡À15. Inflation targeting was introduced that summer, and the currency became fully convertible. The crawling peg was abandoned in October of the same year, and the central parity of the forint was fixed. Despite the central bank's shift towards inflation targeting, they maintained the central parity and fluctuation zone. This meant that they aimed to achieve two goals, controlling both inflation and exchange rates, using a single instrument - interest rates. This task was further complicated by free movement of capital. Although inflation was subsiding, Hungarian authorities decided to fix the currency, anticipating lower pressure on nominal exchange rates."," The central bank was uneasy about the persisting inflation pressures and took measures to address them by implementing monetary restrictions in May 2001, which included widening the fluctuation band from ¡À2.25 to ¡À15.

" The issue of higher inflation gave rise to a negative trajectory of surging indebtedness in foreign currencies, which persisted in the subsequent years. This situation posed a significant problem for households that frequently availed mortgages in Swiss francs or euros. The percentage and growth of this type of debt can be observed in the chart below. Over time, this trend was mainly triggered by heightened inflation and the fact that interest rates in Hungary were higher than in developed countries. This hazardous borrowing trend did not cause any issues as long as the exchange rate remained stagnant or appreciated."," The problem of higher inflation led to a negative trajectory of increasing indebtedness in foreign currencies, which continued to persist in the following years. This proved to be a significant issue for households opting for mortgages in Swiss francs or euros. The chart presented below showcases the share and progression of this type of debt.

" It should be noted that despite the presence of high government deficits during the period discussed in Figure 2, there was no simultaneous growth in government debt. The succeeding chart confirms this. However, both the rising government debt and indebtedness in foreign currencies produced detrimental effects on the Hungarian economy during the second half of the 2000s."," The data presented in Figure 2 indicate that there were considerable government deficits, but interestingly, there was no evident increase of government debt during the period being discussed. This fact is supported by the subsequent chart as well.

However, the negative trends of accumulating government debt and indebtedness in foreign currencies were crucial factors that contributed to the significant economic issues plaguing Hungary in the latter half of the 2000s. Such trends must be carefully monitored and addressed to prevent their adverse impacts in the future."
" At the outset of the transformation process, there were notable variations among central European countries. Regarding ownership matters, the disparity was most apparent in the managerial positions of state-owned businesses. While Hungarian managers had substantial control and influence, their Czechoslovakian counterparts were deemed less favorable, often criticized for their association with the Communist regime. Consequently, Hungarian managers were able to seize ownership of thousands of companies even before the 1990s, leading to the spontaneous privatization of the country's economy."," Central European nations had distinct differences at the onset of the transition process. One significant contrast was the role of state company managers and ownership. The Hungarian government recognized the experience and qualifications of these managers, allowing them to acquire control of various companies in the late 1980s. On the other hand, Czechoslovakia viewed state company managers as high-ranking members of the Communist party, hindering their participation in the privatization process. This disparity resulted in spontaneous privatization in Hungary, where managers had much more impact in the country's economic transformation."," Differences between central European countries became apparent during the transformation process, with ownership being a significant issue. One of the critical distinctions was the role of state-owned company managers. In Hungary, managers had more prominence and acceptance, while in Czechoslovakia, they were seen as significant figures of the Communist regime. In Hungary, these managers seized the opportunity to acquire control over several companies in the late 1980s, bypassing the privatization process, leading to what became known as spontaneous privatization."
" The survey results revealed that the general population's opinion on privatization was mixed. Hungary demonstrated minimal support for restitutions, with a relatively strong resistance to the process of privatizing state-owned companies, compared to other Eastern European countries. The data also highlighted that the highest support for privatization was in selling companies for the highest possible price. In a study conducted by Laki (1993), it was found that 34% of respondents were against privatization in general, while 55-60% opposed privatizing their own company. Additionally, foreign investment and the return of former landowners were met with staunch opposition."," The results of the survey demonstrated that the public's stance on privatization was far from unanimous. Hungary exhibited low levels of support for restitutions (re-privatization) and displayed an overarching reluctance to privatize state-owned organizations, relative to other countries in Eastern Europe. However, the data indicated that the populace was most in favor of selling companies at the highest possible price. According to Laki (1993), 34% of the study respondents opposed privatization overall and 55-60% were against the privatization of their own company. The survey also revealed widespread opposition to foreign investment and the reestablishment of the landowners from before."," The survey demonstrates that the public's attitude towards privatization was not entirely clear. Hungary displayed minimal support for restitutions (re-privatization), and there was a relatively strong resistance to the privatization of state-owned organizations compared to other countries in Eastern Europe. However, the study revealed that the highest number of participants supported selling companies for the highest possible price. According to Laki's (1993) research, 34% of the respondents were against privatization, while 55-60% opposed the privatization of their current company. Furthermore, there was robust opposition to foreign investment, as well as a call to stop the return of previous landowners."
" In Hungary, the transformation of state-owned companies into joint-stock companies in 1988 was a significant event. This change granted management greater control over the companies. Hungarian privatization at the start of the following decade saw insiders continue to play a key role in decision-making. Earle and Estrin (1996) argue that the government had to gain the consent of insiders before selling or retaining full ownership of a company to outsiders. Management's misuse of this power resulted in various scandals and embezzlement cases. As a result, the public grew sceptical of the privatization process, which hindered its progress, leading to a slowdown, according to Srholec (2001)."," During the late 1980s in Hungary, the government passed an act that allowed state-run companies to transform into joint-stock companies. This move gave management significant power and control over the companies they operated. Subsequently, in the early 1990s, insiders retained their dominance within the privatization process. This was highlighted by Earle and Estrin (1996), who noted that the government needed to acquire insider's consent before being able to sell the firm to outsiders or retain complete ownership. Unfortunately, these management teams began to abuse their power, which led to immense scandals and embezzlement cases. The public's negative attitude toward the privatization process resulted in a slowdown and hindered the progress of the overall process, according to Srholec (2001)."," In Hungary, a pivotal moment came in 1988 when state companies were authorized to turn into joint-stock companies. This change gave management the power to take over these businesses. During the 1990s, the insider's dominance in the privatization process continued. Earle and Estrin (1996) noted that without insider consent, the government could neither sell a company to outsiders nor maintain full ownership. Unfortunately, management abused their power, leading to scandals and embezzlement cases. The public, as a result, opposed this type of privatization, and this significantly slowed down the whole process, as reported by Srholec (2001)."
" The establishment of the state Property Fund (SPA) in 1990 was an essential step towards creating a framework for privatization in Ukraine. With almost 2,000 state-owned companies under its control, SPA became the central agency responsible for the sale of these entities. According to some experts, SPA was instrumental in preventing further abuse because they had the power to approve all sales. As a result, the institutional environment in Ukraine began to evolve, creating a more transparent and streamlined privatization process."," As an integral part of Ukraine's institutional environment, the state Property Fund (SPA) was established in 1990, with the aim of facilitating the privatization of state-owned companies. SPA had a significant role in determining the terms of sale and had the authority to approve all transactions, which helped in preventing fraudulent practices in the privatization process. According to Earle and Estrin (1996), SPA's role in approving sales helped avert more severe violations. With almost 2,000 state-owned companies under its purview, SPA played a central role in privatization during Ukraine's transition from a planned economy to a market economy."," In 1990, Ukraine's state Property Fund (SPA) was established to oversee and coordinate the privatization of state-owned assets. SPA was responsible for a large number of companies, approximately 1,975 in total, with a significant number of them in the industry and agricultural sectors. SPA had complete authority to approve all sales contracts, which led to a more transparent and streamlined privatization process. According to Earle and Estrin (1996), SPA's approval of sales contracts helped prevent any undue abuse in the privatization process. With SPA's guidance, Ukraine's institutional environment adapted to accommodate the shift towards a market economy."
" The government, in the meantime, launched a small privatization process with their first program called Minimizing Privatization, commencing in May 1990, which mainly targeted retail as one of the goals was to prevent impulsive privatization. Although the selling or leasing of roughly 10,000 units dominated the period between 1991 and 1993, the shops and restaurants auctioned off were mostly small. One key aspect of this type of privatization was that employees of the respective shops gained the majority of the property. The changes in property ownership are outlined in the following table."," While working towards other goals, the government simultaneously commenced a small privatization process with their first program, launched in May 1990 and called Pre-Privatization, which targeted the retail sector. The main aim was to prevent haphazard privatization by auctioning or selling off approximately 10,000 units, mainly small-scale shops and restaurants between 1991 and 1993. The majority of the property was obtained by the employees of the respective shops, which was a crucial factor. Detailed data on the shift in property ownership can be found in the following table."," In addition to their other endeavours, the government launched a small privatization process with their first initiative, which was called Pre-Privatization and started in May 1990. The retail sector was targeted, and one of the objectives was to prevent impulsive privatization. Small shops and restaurants mostly filled about 10,000 units, which were sold or leased from 1991 to 1993. The attribute that distinguished this approach to privatization was that the property was predominantly owned by the workers of the respective shops. The modifications in property ownership can be viewed in the subsequent table."
" During mid-1995, SPA sold a significant portion of its ownership, which represented only 35% of state property. Even after the divestment, the government still owned several industries like gas distribution, railways, airlines, telecommunication, banks, and chemical companies. However, the fiscal deficit prompted the government to initiate the intensification of the privatization process. This led to the decision to sell all the state-owned property apart from railways, national parks, and post office. The privatization program targeted assets worth HUF 1.3 trillion, which was a massive inflow of foreign direct investment in Hungary. Through direct sales to foreign investors, the government sold properties worth HUF 790 billion, which helped to decrease the national debt from 86% of GDP in 1995 to 60% in 1998."," The 1995 SPA divestiture saw 75% of the previous ownership sold off, representing just 35% of the state property. Nevertheless, the government retained ownership in various industries like gas distribution, railways, airlines, telecommunication, banks, and chemical companies. However, the Bokros package was introduced due to the urgent need for fiscal deficit reduction. One way to achieve this was to intensify the privatization process, leading to the decision to sell all state-owned property, except for railways, post office, and national parks. The HUF 1.3 trillion worth of state property targeted for privatization resulted in a significant inflow of foreign direct investment, and direct sales to foreign investors saw the government selling properties worth HUF 790 billion. This resulted in the decrease of the national debt from 86% of GDP in 1995 to 60% in 1998."," At the midpoint of 1995, SPA sold 75% of its previous ownership, which accounted for just 35% of the state's property.

" The figure displays the growth of the economy in Hungary, where it can be seen that the nation encountered a transformational recession similar to other central European countries. Despite its gradualist reforms, the nation still experienced a slowdown in its economic activity following 1995. However, a positive trend is recognizable. Contrastingly, results garnered from the HP filter under communist rule versus post-1990 portrayed Hungary's economy with a capacity for achieving an increase of around 3-4 percent after overcoming the transformational recession."," The diagram illustrates the progression of the economy in Hungary. Similarly to other central European nations, Hungary also encountered a transformational recession despite its gradualist policies. This eventually led to a significant decrease in the nation's economic activity after 1995. Nevertheless, the general tendency is on an upswing. Judging by the HP filter values, the country's economic growth rate improved post-1990, when compared with the communist period. The Hungarian economy has overcome the setbacks of transformation recession and was able to achieve a growth rate of around 3-4 percent."," The chart depicts the economic growth trend in Hungary. The country underwent a transformational recession similar to other central European nations, despite adopting a gradualist approach to reforms. This led to a sluggish economic activity after 1995.

" Economic transformation in Hungary saw a rise in unemployment, although the country followed a gradual approach. The unemployment rate peaked at 12% of labor force before decreasing at a gradual rate. Unlike the Czech Republic, where the unemployment rate remained low until 1997, when it shot up due to currency and economic crises. Despite this, Hungary's unemployment rate had already been on the decline by the time they were facing a similar economic downturn. It's noteworthy that both Hungary and the Czech Republic had lower unemployment rates than other countries in the post-communist era, such as Poland. Nonetheless, the employment levels in Hungary plunged, affecting the overall figures."," Hungary, despite implementing a gradual approach, was not spared the effects of unemployment during the early stages of economic transformation. The country witnessed a peak in unemployment of around 12% of the labor force before it gradually declined. Conversely, the Czech Republic maintained minimal unemployment rates until 1997 when currency and economic crises led to a sudden surge. But, Hungary had already begun reducing their unemployment rate at that time. It's important to note that both countries had comparably lower unemployment rates than other post-communist nations. However, the drop in employment levels in Hungary severely impacted the figures."," In the early stages of economic transformation, Hungary faced an increase in unemployment rates, despite a gradual approach to reform.

" The current methods of testing economic literacy are not effective in measuring students' understanding of the economy itself.

" By studying economics based on facts and objectivity, learners can gain a realistic understanding of their local economy functions. This serves as a foundation for students to form logical conclusions about where the economy is headed and how it should be directed. Instructors play a crucial role in guiding students by imparting their knowledge of different models that explain how the economy works, and the basic details of economic variables. In this context, the emphasis lies in giving students factual information about authentic economic variables, which could impact the choices they make regarding any economic issues that arise. The selection of models to be taught lies beyond the scope of this work."," When learners study economics that is grounded in facts and objectivity, they gain a comprehensive understanding of the economic system they are a part of. This knowledge offers a strong foundation for them to predict where the economy is headed and make informed estimations on how it can be directed. As far as the instructors are concerned, they play two critical roles in educating students. Firstly, they must introduce students to different models that explain how the economy works, and secondly, they must provide students with factual information about economic variables so that they can use these models efficiently.

" The appropriateness of defining literacy in this way has been a topic of discussion among scholars. Hansen, Salemi, and Siegfried published a paper in 2002 exploring potential strategies for restructuring college courses to improve literacy attainment. They assert that the current introductory classes, which place a significant emphasis on technical literacy, do not serve the majority of students who will not continue studying economics. Hansen, Salemi, and Siegfried refer to research demonstrating that college economics course-takers scored 9 out of 15 on a survey, high school economics course takers scored 8, and those who didn't study economics scored 7 (2002, 463). Their proposal is to reorganize the introductory course sequence to prioritize the discussion of relevant problems, issues, and puzzles to improve engagement and practice (468)."," Defining literacy in this way has sparked some debate, and Hansen, Salemi, and Siegfried addressed the topic in a 2002 paper outlining potential changes to college economics courses.

" It is often suggested that those promoting the practice of economics have a genuine desire to improve students' understanding of the subject. However, it is unclear what this statement entails precisely. Does it involve teaching students to think in terms of maximizing utility? If so, does this suggest that utility maximization is not an innate concept and must be learned? Does it merely include introducing our students to the best economic models available and leaving it at that? While introducing students to these models is essential, neglecting to provide them with a basic understanding of the genuine economic variables has negative consequences. The equivalent of building a car but not explaining that fuel is necessary to make it run is to introduce students to economic models without teaching them the facts from which these models are derived. Consequently, it seems reasonable that we should educate our students on the data that underpins these models and how to apply them effectively."," When individuals put forward the goal of ""practicing economics,"" it is reasonable to assume that their intentions are honest and focused on enhancing students' comprehension. However, the statement's meaning is ambiguous. Does it involve teaching students how to maximize utility? Is utility maximization a learned concept rather than a natural state? Does it mean introducing students to the best economic models available and leaving it at that? While introducing models can be beneficial, without basic knowledge about the genuine economic variables, there will inevitably be negative consequences. It is akin to helping students construct a car without telling them that gas is essential for the vehicle to operate. Given the persuasive power of economic analysis, it seems reasonable that we should be obligated to provide our students with factual information and teach them how to apply their knowledge to the economic models we teach."," Those who advocate for ""practicing economics"" likely have the best intentions of enhancing student understanding, yet this statement is vague. Does it imply that teaching students to think in terms of utility maximization is essential? If so, does this mean that utility maximization is a learned behavior and not inherent? Is it enough to introduce students to the most effective economic models currently available, or is more needed? While teaching students models is helpful, without a fundamental understanding of authentic economic variables, there will inevitably be adverse effects. It is like helping students construct a car without teaching them that gasoline is required for it to run. Given the powerful persuasion of basic economic analysis, it is reasonable to expect that educators should provide students with factual information and teach them how to apply this knowledge effectively to any models we teach."

" The study of economics depends heavily on the specific facts that are deemed relevant to the discipline, as this helps delimit the scope of the subject matter. Due to this reliance on selective facts, economic instruction that focuses purely on empirical data has become less important. While subjects such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment are commonly agreed upon as important macro topics, various economists might pay more attention to issues such as poverty, income inequality and the fluctuating nature of these variables. Additionally, some experts might stress the role of banking and interest rates, while others shift their emphasis towards explaining how different mechanisms within the tax system or social security function. Despite these variations in approach, it is unclear if students are being exposed to accurate and up-to-date information about the real-world data that undergirds these topics, and whether they are obtaining a solid grasp of the most significant issues at play."," In economics, the selection of facts that are deemed relevant to the field is crucial as it ultimately defines the boundaries of the subject.

" In this scholarly article, a thorough analysis is conducted on the relationship between economic freedom, foreign direct investment (FDI), and economic growth across a sample of 85 countries. The results derived from the generalized method-of-moment system estimator expose that FDI in isolation does not yield any apparent (positive) impacts on output growth. Conversely, the effectuation of FDI is subject to economic freedom levels in the host country.

" There has been a great deal of debate among economists about the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on growth. This discussion has become particularly relevant in recent years as policymakers have sought to increase FDI inflows by relaxing restrictions on foreign capital. Since the 1980s, many countries - including developing nations - have lifted barriers to FDI, and global FDI inflows have increased dramatically as a result. Over the last few decades, the growth rate of global FDI has surpassed both world trade and GDP. This increase in FDI is believed to have many positive effects, such as enhanced productivity, the transfer of new technology, the introduction of new production processes and management techniques, employee training, and international network expansion. Moreover, FDI is considered a more stable form of investment than other types of capital, such as short-term investments, which are more prone to market fluctuations."," Throughout the economic literature, there has been ongoing discussion regarding the effect that foreign direct investment (FDI) has on growth. This conversation has become increasingly relevant as policymakers place greater emphasis on attracting FDI inflows, resulting in the removal of numerous restrictions on foreign capital since the 1980s. As a result, the world has witnessed a sharp rise in global FDI inflows from $57 billion in 1982 to $1271 billion in 2000, with the growth rate of global FDI over the past few decades exceeding that of world trade and GDP. Among the advantages of FDI are productivity gains, the sharing of new technology, the introduction of fresh processes and management techniques, employee training, and international production networks, which have resulted in heightened attention towards drawing investment flows. FDI is also viewed as a less volatile form of investment compared to other types of capital, making it less detrimental to markets."," The link between foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth has been widely debated by economists.

Many experts believe that FDI has numerous benefits, including productivity gains, the introduction of new technology, new processes and management techniques, employee training, and international production networks. Moreover, FDI is seen as a more stable form of investment compared to short-term capital, as it is less vulnerable to market fluctuations. Its positive impacts have led to an increased push for attracting FDI inflows."
" This paper aims to expand the understanding of the relationship between foreign investment and economic growth by examining the influence of institutional factors. Recent literature has acknowledged the significance of freedom of economic activity in facilitating FDI spillovers, which involves the transfer of technology and knowledge from multinational enterprises to host countries.

" This article aims to explore the potential relationship between economic freedom and growth by using Fraser Institute's index of economic freedom (EF). The index measures institutional quality and reveals the characteristics of a prosperous environment. By examining the index components, we anticipate that high EF levels in countries will increase their absorptive capacity and allow them to gain more benefits from FDI spillovers. Researchers generally agree that less regulation is better for economic progress. A free and competitive market leads to more opportunities for entrepreneurs to explore ideas, and encourages firms to have a go at risky ventures such as FDI-related activities, in pursuit of higher returns for their investment. On the other hand, if the market is heavily regulated, it would negatively impact resource allocation. If financial markets are too closely regulated, then the adoption of new technology will not be feasible for firms that require external funding to finance their FDI-related activities.

Researchers agree that regulatory interference tends to have negative consequences for economic progress. A free and open market creates better opportunities for entrepreneurs to experiment with new concepts and strive for riskier ventures like FDI-related activities, hoping to boost their investment returns. Conversely, a heavily regulated market performs poorly and adversely affects resource allocation. Firms looking to adopt new technology who require external funding will suffer if financial markets are heavily regulated, affecting FDI-related activities (Alfaro et al., 2004)."," This paper examines the potential link between economic freedom and growth by utilizing the index of economic freedom (EF) provided by the Fraser Institute.

Most researchers concur that less regulation facilitates economic progress. A free and competitive market creates more opportunities for entrepreneurs to innovate new concepts and encourages firms to take on riskier ventures like FDI related activities, looking to earn higher returns on their investment. In contrast, a heavily regulated market will not function optimally and would impact resource allocation adversely.

" Tax incentives and subsidies, as well as policies that aim to encourage FDI, are often implemented with the expectation that foreign investment will bring extensive benefits to the receiving country. MNCs are a significant contributor to advanced technologies, patents, trade secrets, brand names, management techniques, and marketing strategies, and are recognized to be among the world's most technologically advanced firms, with an additional responsibility for much of the world's R&D expenditures. MNCs also hire a high number of both technical and professional employees, and through FDIs, recipient countries can gain instant access to new innovations that can benefit not only the receiving companies but also other businesses in the host country. Additionally, FDIs may have growth effects similar to domestic investments, which can contribute to the mitigation of balance-of-payment deficits. Furthermore, MNCs train managers and workers who could later join local businesses, and export-oriented FDIs can aid in promoting exports by creating assembling plants and supporting local companies in accessing overseas markets for exports."," The offering of tax incentives, subsidies, and FDI-stimulating policies is aimed at reaping the benefits from foreign investment by the recipient countries.

Besides, FDIs can cause positive effects on the country's balance-of-payment deficits through increased capital stock, similar to those from domestic investments. MNCs also typically provide training for managers and workers, thereby creating a valuable skill base for the country's workforce. Furthermore, export-oriented FDIs can promote export activities through the creation of assembling plants and aiding local firms in exploring export opportunities in the international market."," Tax incentives, subsidies, and policies to attract foreign direct investment are implemented by countries in anticipation of the extensive benefits that FDI can bring. Multinational Corporations are well-known for their advanced technology, such as patents, trade secrets, brand names, management techniques, and marketing strategies. MNCs are among the world's most technologically advanced and responsible for most of the world's R&D expenditures, and they employ a large number of technical and professional employees. FDIs allow the recipient country to obtain instant access to advanced technology, which can bring advantages not only to the companies themselves but also to other businesses in the host country. FDIs and domestic investments exhibit similar growth effects, which can help to reduce the balance-of-payment deficits. Moreover, MNCs can train local managers and workers, adding to the existing pool of skilled workers. Furthermore, export-oriented FDIs can aid in promoting exports by developing assembling plants and supporting local firms in accessing foreign markets for exports."
" As per the ongoing debate on the adoption of new technologies, the need for skilled labor to handle such systems and work with its intricacies has been a topic of discussion. Researchers Borensztein et al. conducted a study in 1998, where they found that FDI inflows had a minimal direct impact on growth rates. However, in countries where the level of human capital was above a certain threshold, it did positively contribute towards growth, especially when FDI was paired with the country's labor force's education level. Meanwhile, domestic investment did not yield any significant results on this front, possibly because of the technological differences between FDI and domestic investment. Essentially, this means that the benefits of FDI are more likely to be reaped by developed countries with higher levels of human capital than developing nations. Adding further support to this conjecture, Xu discovered that technology transfer by U.S. MNCs contributed to productivity growth in developed countries, but not in developing countries. However, Alfaro et al. argued in 2004 that human capital was not the critical mediator of FDI inflows. Instead, they believed that the financial sector's development was a more vital factor in driving FDI spillovers."," The incorporation of new technologies necessitates skilled labor to understand and operate dynamic systems. According to Borensztein et al.'s 1998 research, FDI  succeeded in having a minor direct effect on growth rates. Nonetheless, in countries where human capital surpassed a certain threshold, it positively influenced growth rates when FDI interacted with the educational level of the country's workforce. On the contrary, domestic investment demonstrated no significant impact, indicating clear technological differences between FDI and local investments. Therefore, developed countries having a higher level of human capital are more likely to benefit from FDIs, as highlighted by Xu's 2000 study. He found that technology transfer by US MNCs contributed to productivity growth in developed countries but not enough in developing countries. Despite being different, Alfaro et al. argued in 2004 that human capital was not as crucial a mediator of FDI inflows. Instead, they proposed that the financial sector's growth was more important than human capital in driving FDI spillovers."," The adoption and integration of new technology require an adequate workforce with the knowledge and skills to operate them. Borensztein et al.'s study based on FDI inflows in 1998 showed that it had only a marginal direct effect on growth. However, in countries having a higher level of human capital, FDI positively correlates with growth rates. This meant FDI is more efficient in nations with high education levels. However, Alfaro et al. in 2004 presented a contrasting view, stating that human capital is irrelevant in mediating FDI inflows. They suggested that the primary driving force behind FDI spillovers lies in the financial sector's development rather than in human capital. Similarly, Xu's research in 2000 supported the belief that technology transfer by US MNCs contributes to productivity growth in developed countries but not in developing countries. Therefore, it implies that developed countries will have an upper hand in benefiting from FDIs because of their higher level of human capital."
" Despite the extensive research on the connection between FDI and economic growth, there remains a lack of consensus regarding its impact. However, the evidence regarding the significance of institutions in the process of development is rather strong. North (1990), considered as a prominent institutional economist, describes institutions as the social and economic customs, policies, and regulations established by humans that shape their interactions. Formal procedures, including constitutions and property rights reinforced by courts and law enforcement systems, as well as informal restrictions like customs, taboos, and traditional practices, are integral aspects of these institutions. The incentive structure of the economy is dependent on the evolution of institutional rules, shaping economic change towards growth. Put simply, institutions impact the security of property rights, prevalence of corruption, distorted or extractive policies. As a result, they influence the decision to invest in human and physical capital, leading to economic development."," Although there is some ambiguity in the empirical evidence concerning the relationship between FDI and growth, there is more definitive evidence on the role of institutions in the development process. North (1990), a renowned economic institutionalist, defines institutions as the practical constraints and regulations that humans design to structure their political, economic, and social interactions. Such institutions include formal rules like constitutions, laws, and property rights that are enforced through courts and law enforcement, along with informal restrictions like customs, traditions, and codes of conduct. Institutions are responsible for shaping the incentive structure of the economy, and as they evolve, they steer economic changes towards growth. In brief, institutions impact the security of property rights, the prevalence of corruption, and the presence of distorted or extractive policies, and therefore affect the decision to invest in human and physical capital, ultimately influencing economic growth."," While the empirical data on the connection between FDI and growth is not entirely consistent, there is more compelling evidence supporting the role of institutions in the development process. North (1990), who is one of the most well-known economic institutionalists of the modern era, describes institutions as the set of human-designed constraints or rules of the game that guide political, economic, and social interactions. These institutions are made up of formal structures like constitutions, laws, and property rights that are implemented through the court and police systems, as well as informal constraints like traditions, customs, and codes of behavior. The incentive structure of the economy hinges on the progression of institutional rules, which shape economic change towards growth. In sum, institutions influence the security of property rights, prevalence of corruption, the existence of distorted or extractive policies, and ultimately affect the choice to invest in human and physical capital, thereby influencing economic growth."
" A plethora of recent research has underscored the critical role of institutions in spurring economic development. Knack and Keefer were among the first to employ property right security indicators as stand-ins for institutional quality in growth literature using the ICRG and the BERI indices. Institutional benchmarks focus on the bureaucracy's excellence, property rights and political stability of a nation, which are all vital to economic performance. Statistical analysis reveals a significant, positive association between all these factors and economic development. Barro contends that secure property rights fosters investment and amplifies investment productivity, thus advancing growth. Furthermore, Demetriades and Law's findings suggest that potent institutions are weightier in explaining output per capita in low-income regions than financial progressions. Rodrik et al. demonstrate that institutional standard takes precedence over geography and integration (such as international trade) in explaining cross-country wage gaps. Finally, Acemoglu et al. measure institutional effectiveness using the ICRG's protection from expropriation risk index."," There is mounting evidence to suggest that the presence of robust institutions is integral to driving economic development. Early proponents of this thesis, Knack and Keefer, used the ICRG and BERI indices as proxies for institutional quality, specifically gauging indicators of bureaucratic quality, property rights, and political stability. Across several countries, the analysis shows that these factors have a positive relationship with economic performance. In their work, Barro highlights the connection between secure property rights and growth. Specifically, secure property rights drive investments, and this ultimately enhances productivity and boosts economic performance. In addition to this, Demetriades and Law's empirical evidence suggests that stronger institutions are more useful than financial advancements when explaining per capita output in low-income countries. Studies by Rodrik et al. suggest that institutional quality is more important than geography or integration, as evidenced by international trade, in explaining cross-country income gaps. Acemoglu et al. use the ICRG's protection from expropriation risk index to measure the efficiency of institutions."," The importance of institutions in facilitating economic development has been substantiated by recent studies. Knack and Keefer pioneered the use of property rights security markers as proxies for institutional excellence in growth literature, mainly relying on indices such as ICRG and BERI. These institutional indicators focus on the quality of bureaucracy, property rights, and political stability of a nation. Among cross-country evaluations, all these factors demonstrate a positive and statistically significant relationship with successful economic performance. Barro argues that secure property rights stimulate investments and increase investment efficiency, promoting growth. Meanwhile, Demetriades and Law establish that stronger institutions play a more significant role in explaining low-income countries' output levels than financial progressions. For Rodrik et al., institutional quality is more critical than geographical endowments or integration in accounting for cross-country income disparities, and this is evident from international trade. Acemoglu et al. use the ICRG's expropriation risk index to measure institutional efficiency."
" The current literature on the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth lacks sufficient empirical studies on the effects of economic freedom (EF) on FDI spillovers. Though there is a theoretical argument that greater EF can enhance the benefits of hosting multinational corporations (MNCs), there is no concrete evidence to support this perspective. Therefore, additional empirical research is necessary to provide a clearer understanding of the relationship between EF and the impact of FDI on economic growth. This would be a crucial step in advancing the academic discourse on FDI and growth."," The literature on the FDI-growth relationship is yet to explore in depth the impact of economic freedom on FDI spillovers. The conjecture that countries with greater economic freedom may benefit more from the presence of multinational firms is a plausible one, but no conclusive evidence is available to support it. Given this research gap, empirical studies that investigate the potential mediating role of EF in the FDI-growth nexus are much needed. Such investigations would help to confirm or refute this hypothesis and contribute to the existing knowledge on the subject."," Although several studies have examined the relationship between foreign direct investment and economic growth, there remains a limited understanding of how economic freedom influences FDI spillovers. Countries with greater economic freedom may have better regulatory frameworks that facilitate multinational corporations' entry and operations, but the empirical evidence supporting this argument is scarce. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct further empirical research that explores how economic freedom shapes the effects of FDI on economic growth. Through such research, scholars can have a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms through which FDI can foster economic growth across different institutional contexts."
" The process of GMM estimation typically involves the use of either one- or two-step variants. While one-step estimators make use of independent weighting matrices, the two-step variant utilizes an optimal weighting matrix which weights the moment conditions using consistent estimates of their covariance matrix. However, the two-step GMM estimator has been found to pose several issues when applied to small samples due to instrument proliferation. In particular, Windmeijer's simulation analysis reveals how the use of numerous instruments with the two-step GMM estimator can result in biased parameter estimates and standard errors. Similarly, Bowsher notes that too many instruments may weaken the overidentification test, causing it to fail to reject the null hypothesis of joint validity. To mitigate these problems, Roodman recommends reducing the dimensionality of the instrumental variable matrix."," The GMM estimation technique has both one- and two-step variants.

" Based on our investigation using panel data for 85 countries from 1975 to 2004, our empirical analysis revealed three significant conclusions. Firstly, our findings are consistent with prior studies in which FDI alone has no direct impact on output growth. Secondly, we discovered that economic freedom (EF) is a critical driver of long-term growth in the countries we examined. Additionally, our study supported previous reports by de Haan and Sturm (2000) as well as Sturm and De Haan (2001) on the positive correlation between EF and growth. Finally, we discovered that the impact of FDI on growth depended on the level of economic freedom. Countries with high levels of EF, including developing nations, benefited significantly from the presence of multinational corporations (MNCs). These countries could quickly adopt new technologies and other advantages, resulting in better performance.

" The freedom to trade across borders can be beneficial for domestic producers seeking to expand into international markets by exporting their goods. This involves significant costs in creating distribution channels, setting up transportation infrastructure, and understanding the preferences of foreign consumers. MNCs are usually better equipped to bear these expenses than domestic companies. However, domestic firms can reduce their entry costs into foreign markets by studying the processes of foreign exporters and collaborating with them. These gains may result in improved productivity in domestic firms. Additionally, international trade may allow domestic producers to employ a broader array of intermediate products and capital equipment, leading to greater efficiency in resource use."," Allowing for the free exchange of goods and services across borders may be advantageous for domestic companies looking to expand their reach by exporting to overseas markets. Export activities require significant costs in establishing distribution networks, setting up transportation infrastructure, and understanding the preferences of foreign consumers, which multinational corporations are typically better equipped to handle. Domestic firms may be able to lower their entry costs into foreign markets by observing the operations of foreign exporters and engaging in collaborative efforts.

" Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) spillovers are greatly influenced by the regulatory landscape within the host country. Reduction of regulatory constraints like those present in labor, business and access to credit can provide an impetus for FDI spillovers. Regulations on hiring and firing of workers play an important role in labor mobility across firms. With fewer restrictions, workers who have gained knowledge and experience from MNCs can transfer the same expertise to domestic firms. Considering the level of restrictions on business operations, market competition proves to be a critical factor for FDI spillovers. Where the level of competition in the industry is high due to fewer regulations, MNCs exhibit greater willingness to transfer their technology to domestic suppliers. Access to external funding also plays a crucial role in technology upgrading. If regulatory constraints are relaxed, external funds become easily accessible, thereby enhancing the chances of success of domestic firms in acquiring new technology. This has been emphasized by Alfaro et al. (2004)."," Regulatory constraints have a significant impact on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) spillovers within the host country. Reduction of restrictions on factors like labor, business, and credit can aid in spillover of FDI. Fewer regulations regarding the hiring and firing procedures encourage labor mobility across firms, enabling workers to transfer knowledge and experience gained from MNCs to domestic firms more easily. The degree of regulation on business activities can also severely impact FDI spillover targets by influencing market competitiveness. When industries face high regulatory freedom, MNCs are more willing to transfer technology to domestic suppliers, thus ensuring a more desirable price for intermediate goods. Access to external funds plays a crucial role in acquiring new technology, making liberalization of regulatory constraints an attractive strategy to enhance the availability of external funds. These findings have been emphasized by Alfaro et al. (2004)."," The regulatory framework in a particular country has a vital role to play in the spillover of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Relaxing constraints on labor, business, and credit could act as a catalyst for FDI spillovers. Controlled regulations for hiring and firing of workers encourage workers' mobility, and those who have previously worked with MNCs can easily transfer their knowledge and experience to domestic firms. An industry with a low level of regulatory constraints enables high market competition, which influences MNCs to transfer technology to local suppliers to enjoy intermediate goods at the most competitive prices. Access to external funding is critical for technology upgrades. Stricter regulatory frameworks can restrict normal access to external funding. Hence reducing regulatory constraints will enable successful domestic firms to acquire new technology easily. The research paper by Alfaro et al. (2004) has shown the importance of financial markets for FDI spillovers as well."
" When it comes to designing policies that can attract FDI, it is essential for policymakers to consider the financial implications versus the potential outcomes of policies aimed at streamlining EF. Policymakers should emphasize policies that foster economic freedom since they are more likely to generate increased profits. Countries that fail to prioritize these policies will most likely be outcompeted. Potential investors should understand the policies that policymakers are implementing before introducing other measures aimed at attracting more FDI. However, the implementation of such policies may face several challenges, which requires a strong and long-term commitment for the reforms to be effective. In some cases, political obstacles may arise, making it difficult to introduce the necessary reforms but the long-term economic advantages can be substantial."," Policymakers must carefully evaluate the costs of policies designed to attract FDI compared to those focused on enhancing EF. Policies promoting economic freedom should be prioritized over those that attract FDI since they can deliver more substantial benefits. Countries that neglect such policies will struggle to compete with other nations. Policymakers should establish clear policies to encourage potential investors, along with other incentives to attract FDI. However, implementing these policies can take time and require significant, long-term commitment. There may be short-term political challenges in certain countries, but the potential long-term economic benefits are enormous."," Policymakers should carefully consider the costs of implementing policies aimed at attracting FDI versus those that focus on enhancing EF.

There may be political hurdles in some countries that make it difficult to launch the necessary reforms in the short term, yet the long-term economic gains are typically immense."
" Despite the important discoveries made, it is essential to keep in mind some limitations. Our primary specification's interaction term forces the impact of FDI on growth to increase or decrease monotonically with the level of EF. Nevertheless, it is plausible that FDI can only affect host countries once a particular level of EF is in place. Notably, the benefits of FDI are more pronounced in countries with high absorptive capacity. In contrast, countries with low absorptive capacity experience minimal or no benefits from FDI. This highlights the necessity for a more flexible specification that accounts for various interactions between FDI, economic freedom, and output growth. Perhaps using a regression model based on threshold effects to accommodate the different levels of contingency effects could be a possible solution. Future study will look more into this."," Despite the significant findings, it is important to consider the limitations. In our main specification, the interaction term requires the FDI impact on growth to increase or decrease monotonically with the level of EF. However, a certain level of EF can be required before FDI can have any impact on the host countries. It is important to note that only countries with high absorptive capacity benefit from the foreign capital presence, while the benefits are minimal or non-existent in countries with low absorptive capacity. Adjusting the specification to accommodate the various interactions between FDI, economic freedom, and output growth is necessary. One possible solution is to employ a regression model based on threshold effects to capture the presence of contingency effects. This solution requires future research focus."," Although we have made significant findings, it is essential to keep in mind certain limitations. Our primary specification's interaction term is set in a way that requires the FDI impact on growth to either increase or decrease monotonically with the level of EF. It is possible, however, that a certain level of EF is necessary before FDI can influence host countries. Note that only countries with the highest absorptive capacity are expected to benefit from foreign capital, while those with low absorptive capacity experience little to no benefits. These observations highlight the need for a more adaptable specification that considers the different interactions between FDI, economic freedom, and output growth. One proposal is to establish a regression model based on threshold effects to take into account the presence of contingency effects. This is an area for further research."
