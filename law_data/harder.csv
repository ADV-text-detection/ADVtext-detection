" In this study, we aimed to evaluate the level of economic knowledge among students who were exposed to formal economic instruction during their final year of high school. To carry out the research, our sample was taken from seven high schools in two school districts in Orange County, California. All selected students were enrolled in the economic course which is mandatory for obtaining a high school degree. The Test of Economic Literacy (TEL) was employed as the key performance indicator. The outcome of our pretest-post-test research design indicates that students' initial knowledge of economics was not up to par. However, we found an improvement of 12.3 percentage points of the TEL test scores, on average, after having completed one semester of formal economics instruction."," The aim of this research was to assess the economic knowledge of high school students who undertook formal economic instruction in their final year. We selected our sample from two large school districts in Orange County, California, and included students from seven different high schools. The economic course is compulsory for graduation, and all students were enrolled in it for one semester. The Test of Economic Literacy (TEL) was the main assessment tool. Using a pretest-post-test study design, we observed that students had a weak initial understanding of economics. However, we found an average improvement of 12.3 percentage points in TEL scores after one semester of formal instruction."," This study assessed the economic knowledge of high school students who had undergone formal economic training during their final year. The research was conducted in Orange County, California, and included a total of seven high schools from two major school districts.

" There has been an increase in discussions in the media about the importance of economic and financial literacy, indicating that policymakers and educators are realizing its significance for younger individuals. The attention being given to national summits on economic and financial literacy demonstrates this heightened awareness. Economic education at the high school level has long been emphasized in academic literature, with a growing number of studies examining issues relating to the teaching and learning of economics. These studies include research on economics education at both the high school and college level."," The media is frequently discussing the importance of improving economic and financial literacy, serving as an indication that policymakers and educators are becoming more aware of its significance for children, teenagers, and young adults. Additionally, increased public attention has been given to the National Summit on Economic & Financial Literacy, demonstrating this heightened awareness. Literature on economics education at the high school level has underscored its importance as well, and there is an expanding body of research investigating issues related to the teaching of economics at both the high school and college level."," The media has been frequently discussing the need to improve economic and financial literacy, indicating that policymakers and educators are recognizing its importance for younger individuals.

" Our study examines economic literacy among high school students in Orange County, California. The state made it mandatory for students to study economics since 1985. The course is taught in the senior year and covers both micro and macroeconomic analyses. It is worth noting that California is among the few states (17, according to NCEE June 2007) that require formal economic instruction in secondary education. Despite California's progressive steps in economics education, there is a lack of research that focuses on the effectiveness of formal economics education in the state. Our study aims to fill this research gap."," The economic literacy of high school students in Orange County, California was the focus of our investigation, and we present our findings in this paper. Beginning in 1985, one semester of economics became a requirement for California high school graduation. In their senior year, students take the course, which comprises micro and macroeconomic analyses. California is one of the few states, just 17 according to NCEE June 2007, to mandate formal principles of economics instruction in the secondary level. Despite this being the case, there is a shortage of empirical studies to report on the effectiveness of formal economics education in improving economic literacy in California high school students. Our study seeks to partially fill this gap in research."," The objective of our study was to investigate the economic literacy of high school students in Orange County, California. California has mandated one semester of economics in high school graduation requirements starting in 1985. Senior year students learn about micro and macroeconomic concepts through this course. Interestingly, California is one of only seventeen states according to NCEE June 2007, to mandate formal economic principles at the secondary level of education. There is, however, a lack of empirical research on the effectiveness of formal economics instruction in enhancing economic literacy among high school students in California. Our study attempts to address this gap in the literature."
" We make a valuable contribution to two policy issues of high importance. The first one concerns the effectiveness of high school economics courses in enhancing students' economic literacy level. Our discussion confirms that having a high school economics course helps students perform better in standardized economics tests at a national level. However, through our research design that utilizes a single-state, single county scenario, we bring in more precision and include a range of control variables from a survey and school records. The second policy issue relates to the relationship between gender and ethnicity/race and economic literacy. The available literature indicates that prior to taking an economics course, gender differences exist in terms of economic knowledge, but the impact of gender on subsequent learning is unclear. The literature on the impact of ethnicity and race on economic knowledge is limited, but we utilize our research design to investigate the influence of these factors on economic literacy before and after taking high school economics."," Our work has significance for two major policy issues that require attention. The first issue pertains to the effectiveness of high school economics courses in improving students' economic literacy. Our analysis indicates that a high school economics course can enhance students' performance in standardized economics tests at the national level. To refine this focus, we adopt a research design that employs a single-state, single county scenario with a robust set of control variables derived from our survey and school records. The second policy issue deals with the relationship between gender and ethnicity/race and economic literacy. Prior studies indicate that gender differences exist in economic knowledge before taking an economics course, yet the effects on learning are unclear. While studies on the impact of ethnicity and race on economic knowledge are limited, our research design allows us to explore the effects of gender and ethnicity on economic literacy before and after students take their high school economics course."," Our research is relevant to two significant policy issues. Firstly, we address the effectiveness of high school economics courses in improving students' economic literacy. Our findings show that a high school economics course can enhance students' performance in standardized economics tests at the national level. However, we provide more precision to this issue by adopting a research design that uses a single-state and single county scenario accompanied by a comprehensive set of control variables derived from our survey and school records. Secondly, we examine the impact of gender and ethnicity/race on economic literacy. Previous research has shown gender differences in economic knowledge before taking an economics course, while the impact of gender on subsequent learning is unclear. Although the literature on the impact of ethnicity and race on economic knowledge is limited, we utilize our research design to examine the effects of ethnicity and gender on economic literacy before and after students take their high school economics course."
" To facilitate a more effective investigation into the reasons for variations in student achievement in economics, we narrow our focus onto one state and one county. This approach is beneficial because funding issues, as well as administrative decisions relating to the emphasis placed on economics instruction, vary considerably by state and county. Our research design effectively controls for these differences and allows us to isolate the impact of student characteristics on achievement."," A single-state and single-county approach is adopted in our empirical investigation of the factors contributing to variations in student achievement in economics. The complexity of these factors suggests that funding issues and administrative decisions affect the emphasis placed on economics instruction, which varies significantly by state and county. Our research methodology mitigates these variations and enables us to more effectively examine the role of student characteristics in determining achievement outcomes."," Our research focuses on a single state and a single county to investigate the causes behind differences in student achievement in economics effectively.

" Based on the available literature, it is evident that economics courses are more effective in enhancing students' economic literacy compared to the infusion of economic content in the K-12 curriculum. Several studies have found that students who enroll in economics courses score higher on the Test of Economic Literacy than their counterparts who are enrolled in social studies classes with no economic content or classes with some economic content. Furthermore, other research indicates that nationwide, students who took economics courses tend to have the highest scores on the TEL multiple choice examination. Coupled with the evidence of controlling the selection bias, this supports the assertion that economics courses play a significant role in enhancing students' economic literacy. (Mask used: Paraphrase and synonym)"," According to the literature, research suggests that students taking economics courses experience more significant improvements in their economic literacy than those whose schools integrate economic content throughout K-12 studies.

" The literature has examined the differences in economic literacy between genders, as evidenced by various studies. One of the most cited articles on the matter is by Siegfried [1979], who reviews the literature and finds that, at a specific point in time, males tend to have a slight advantage in their understanding of economics compared to females. More recent works, such as those by Watts [1987], Heath [1989], Walstad and Soper [1989], Evans [1992], and Walstad and Robson [1997], generally support the notion that there is a gender gap in economic knowledge in high school. This gap, which favors males, has been consistently observed in point-in-time measures of economic knowledge."," The literature has analyzed gender differences in economic literacy, and various studies have explored this topic.

" Based on Siegfried's findings, there is insufficient supporting evidence demonstrating women's inferiority in learning economics when considering other relevant factors that might impact the accumulation of economic knowledge. The female initial disadvantage does not appear to change over time when using a pretest-posttest design to measure gain in economic understanding, implying that both men and women learn at comparable rates. Jackstadt and Grootaert, Watts, and Allgood and Walstad published studies in recent literature that produced similar findings. Although Walstad and Soper discovered that there are significant differences favorable to men in learning rates, this outcome was subsequently replicated by Becker and Walstad."," Siegfried's research suggests that there is no compelling evidence indicating women's inferiority in learning economics when accounting for additional factors affecting economic comprehension and knowledge accumulation.

" Research on the influence of race and ethnicity on academic performance has been limited. Nonetheless, a few studies have been conducted to examine this matter. Evans [1992] and Harris and Kerby [1997] considered the impact of students' race and ethnicity in their analyses. Evans concluded that black students achieve lower test scores compared to white students, while Hispanics do not face any significant disadvantage. Conversely, Harris and Kerby discovered that black students are at a significant disadvantage concerning white students, and both Hispanics and Filipinos have considerably low test scores compared to whites. Although Asian students score higher than white students, the difference between them is not statistically significant. Further, Walstad and Soper [1989] found out that black students have worse performance on the TEL than other students. The US Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics also reported that a majority of blacks and Hispanics performed below average level, compared to whites, in their first national assessment of economic literacy for grade 12 students in 2007."," Although limited, some studies have focused on the impact of race and ethnicity on test scores.

The initial two rows display the mean scores for the students' pretests and the difference between the pretest and post-test scores organized by race and ethnicity. Nonetheless, the analysis has excluded African-American students because the number of observations was inadequate to conduct tests. The third and fourth, along with the fifth and sixth, rows of the table show the same information categorized by gender and the fact whether students have taken advanced placement or honors classes or not. Additionally, the table demonstrates the probability values for univariate tests of significance in each case."," The table labeled as Table 2 provides information related to the students' pretest scores and how they changed according to various categories such as race, ethnicity, gender, and academic performance. The first two rows of the table present the sample means of the pretest scores and the difference between the pretest and post-test score organized by race and ethnicity. Unfortunately, African-American students were not included in this analysis due to having an insufficient number of observations to conduct tests.

Unfortunately, African-American students could not be part of this analysis due to a lack of adequate observations. Rows three and four, and five and six, respectively, impart the same knowledge, split by gender and honors or advanced placement classes taken by the participating students. Lastly, the table imparts probability values for univariate tests of significance across each category."
" Table 2 reveals that although insignificant, there are gender differences in pretest scores. Male students generally perform better than female students by an average of 3.5 percentage points. Walstad and Rebeck [2001b] suggest that male students who haven't received formal economic education tend to have a 4 percentage point advantage over female students. In addition, students who have taken advanced placement or honors classes have scored higher on the TEL than those who have not, a finding consistent with research by Evans [1992] and Walstad and Rebeck [2001a, b]."," Gender differences in pretest scores, although small, are statistically significant according to Table 2. On average, male students outscore female students by approximately 3.5 percentage points. Furthermore, Walstad and Rebeck's [2001b] research revealed a gender gap of 4 percentage points that benefits male students without formal economic education. Lastly, students who have taken an advanced placement or honors class outperformed their peers who haven't on the TEL. Similar results have been reported by Evans [1992] and Walstad and Rebeck [2001a, b]."," Table 2 exhibits that there are statistically substantial gender differences in pretest scores, with male students outscoring female students by approximately 3.5 percentage points on average. Walstad and Rebeck [2001b] found a gender gap of 4 percentage points that favors male students without formal economic education. Additionally, students who have taken advanced placement or honors courses have outperformed their peers who haven't on the TEL. This conclusion is similar to the results of studies conducted by Evans [1992] and Walstad and Rebeck [2001a, b]."
" In Table 3, Column 1, it is observed that the pretest scores of Hispanic and Asian students are substantially lower than the TEL scores of whites, which is the reference group. This finding is consistent with the results of univariate tests shown in Table 2. However, after conducting multiple regression analysis, it is evident that the white-Hispanic gap in scores has decreased significantly. The difference has been reduced from approximately 11 percentage points listed in Table 2 to about 7 percentage points in Table 3. This indicates that the factors underlying this performance gap could be related to various family background, work effort, and performance characteristics. While African American students have a big negative impact of 11.12 percentage points, the results for African American and Asian students should be analyzed with caution due to the small size of the subgroups involved."," The pretest scores of Hispanic and Asian students are significantly lower than those of white students, as found in Column 1 of Table 3. This result is consistent with the earlier univariate tests reported in Table 2. However, the performance gap between whites and Hispanic students has decreased considerably (from about 11 percentage points in Table 2 to about 7 percentage points in Table 3), as shown by the multiple regression analysis. This suggests that the inferior performance of Hispanic students might be partly explained by differences in their family background, performance ability, and work ethic. While the negative effect on African American students is substantial (11.12 percentage points), we need to be cautious about generalizing the result for Asian and African American students because of the small number of samples available."," The results presented in Column 1 of Table 3 reveal that Hispanic and Asian students' pretest scores are significantly lower than those of white students. These results align with those observed in Table 2. Conversely, when utilizing multiple regression analysis, it is evident that the white-Hispanic gap in scores is narrower (from approximately 11 percentage points in Table 2 to around 7 percentage points in Table 3). This indicates that the disparities in academic achievement between Hispanic and white students may be due, in part, to variations observed in family background, performance, and work ethic. As expected, African American students recorded a substantially unfavorable impact of 11.12 percentage points. However, the outcomes for African American and Asian students need to be interpreted with caution owing to the considerably smaller samples at hand."
" The outcomes presented in Table 3 convey an alternative version of the gender differences mentioned. As per Column 1, males have a 6.4 percentage point benefit, which is noticeably higher (83 percent) than the gender gap exhibited in Table 2. The reason for this could be that males are not performing up to the mark in academic performance factors. Regardless, males perform better than females when it comes to TEL. It implies that if we consider academic performance characteristics, the gender difference in test scores becomes more pronounced."," The results displayed in Table 3 depict a different narrative concerning the impact of gender. In Column 1, the gender effect is determined as a 6.4 percent advantage in favor of males. This discrepancy is 83 percent higher than the gender disparity indicated in Table 2. This could be because males do not perform as well as females in academic performance measures, but they seem to outperform females in the TEL. Thus, when we adjust for academic performance characteristics, the gap between male and female test scores becomes more prominent."," The gender effects reported in Table 3 present a different picture of the situation. In Column 1, the gender effect is shown as a 6.4 percentage point advantage for males. This is considerably higher (83 percent) than the gender difference stated in Table 2. One plausible explanation for this is that even though males lag behind females in academic performance measures, they still perform better than females on the TEL. Consequently, adjusting for the academic performance measures widens the gap between male and female test scores."
" According to the additional results, students who mention English as their primary language for speaking and writing can score approximately 5% higher on the pretest, while students who report living with both parents can score around 3% higher. It is no surprise that academic performance plays a crucial role in predicting a student's success on the pretest, where each one-point increase in academic GPA is associated with almost 9.12% point increase in pretest scores. Moreover, students enrolled in advanced placement economics classes tend to score almost 4% higher on the pretest. However, the variable that determines whether students have taken an AP or honors class is not significant in the pretest regressions."," The supplementary findings demonstrate that students who mention English as their primary language for speaking and writing can obtain approximately 5% higher scores on the pretest. Additionally, students who report living with both parents can achieve about 3% higher scores. As expected, academic performance plays a critical role in predicting success on the pretest: every one-point increase in academic GPA is connected to a nearly 9.12% point rise in pretest scores. Furthermore, students taking advanced placement economics classes tend to score approximately 4% higher on the pretest. Notably, the variable that tracks whether students have ever taken an advanced placement or honors class is not relevant in the pretest regressions."," The additional outcomes suggest that students who identify English as their primary language for speaking and writing can earn almost 5% higher scores on the pretest, while students who report living with both parents can score about 3% more.

Furthermore, students registered in advanced placement economics courses tend to score approximately 4% higher on the pretest. On the other hand, the variable that regulates whether students have ever taken an advanced placement or honors class is insignificant in the pretest regressions."
" When math and reading scores are added to the pretest regression analysis (Table 3, Column 2), it has a negligible effect on the estimated ethnicity and gender effects previously noted in Column 1. The pretest scores increase slightly over 4 percentage points with a reading score increase of ten points. The inclusion of both reading and math scores results in a decrease of the academic GPA impact from 9.12 percentage points to 7.42 percentage points. Conversely, the impact of being currently enrolled in advanced placement economics increases from 3.88 percentage points to 5.78 percentage points."," Incorporating math and reading scores into the pretest regression analysis (Table 3, Column 2) makes minimal changes to the ethnicity and gender effects estimated in Column 1. Pretest scores receive a little over 4% increase with a ten-point increase in reading scores. When math and reading scores are included, the influence of academic GPA is reduced from 9.12 percentage points to 7.42 percentage points. However, the effect of presently studying in advanced placement economics goes up from 3.88 percentage points to 5.78 percentage points."," The impact of math and reading scores on the pretest regression analysis (Table 3, Column 2) is insignificant when it comes to the ethnic and gender effects presented in Column 1.

The effect of taking advanced placement economics increases from 3.88 percentage points to 5.78 percentage points."
" The findings of our study align with previous research on factors that affect a student's economic knowledge in high school. As mentioned in the literature, multiple studies demonstrate significant gender differences, with males performing better than females, and our gender effects being even more pronounced than those reported in previous research, except for the one conducted by Heath. Similarly, academic ability, as indicated by performance in GPA or enrollment in AP courses, is a significant predictor of economic knowledge. A previous study by Jackstadt and Grootaert in 1980 found that grade level, GPA, and part-time work significantly affected students' scores. Furthermore, ethnicity has been identified as a factor, with both Hispanics and Filipinos scoring substantially lower than whites on multiple choice exams, while our study focusing on a single county provides insight into even more significant gender and ethnicity differences than previously reported, especially among Hispanic students, which may be attributable to factors peculiar to Orange County."," Our research validates previous studies that analyze the elements that contribute to a student's economic knowledge in high school. As discussed in the literature review, various studies report that gender differences exist, where males score higher than females, and our findings show this gender effect to be even stronger than previously reported, except for a study conducted by Heath. Similarly, academic competence, as quantified through GPA or AP course participation, is a significant predictor of economic knowledge. A prior investigation by Jackstadt and Grootaert discovered that factors such as grade level, GPA, and holding a part-time job affected students' scores. Furthermore, ethnicity has been shown to be a factor, with lower scores on multiple-choice tests for both Hispanics and Filipinos as compared to whites, as discovered by Harris and Kerby, with scores being 1.47 and 2.34 points lower, respectively. Our research, which focuses on one county, indicates even more significant gender and ethnicity differences than previously found, with Hispanic students showing particular differences, which may be specific to Orange County."," Our study provides confirmation to past research regarding the determinants of economic knowledge among high school students. As mentioned in the literature review, previous studies such as those conducted by Watts, Walstad and Soper, Heath, and Evans all found considerable gender differences, with males scoring higher, although our research found even more significant gender effects compared to prior studies, except for Heath's study. Similarly, academic capability, as measured by GPA or AP courses taken were significant predictors of economic knowledge. Another study conducted by Jackstadt and Grootaert found that factors such as grade level, GPA, and having a part-time job affected students' scores. Ethnicity has also been found to be a factor, with Harris and Kerby reporting lower scores by Hispanics and Filipinos on multiple-choice exams, with scores being 1.47 and 2.34 points lower than whites, respectively. Our study that focuses on a single county indicates gender and ethnicity differences are even more significant than previous research, with Hispanic students showing noticeable variations in test scores, which could be attributed to specific factors within Orange County."
" The high school students in our sample had a weak foundation in economics based on initial knowledge. Descriptive statistics show that pretest TEL scores were highest among white students (55.5%), followed by Asians (48.9%) and Hispanics (44.1%), while males outperformed females by approximately 3.5 percentage points (54.8% and 51.3%, respectively). Analysis of pretest score determinants revealed significant differences between ethnicities and gender, with Hispanics scoring slightly closer to whites when academic performance and family background characteristics were controlled."," The initial knowledge of economics among high school students in our sample was found to be lacking. Upon analyzing the descriptive statistics, it was discovered that white students yielded the highest pretest TEL scores at 55.5%, followed by Asians at 48.9% and Hispanics at 44.1%. The male population outperformed their female peers, boasting 54.8% and 51.3%, respectively. Ethnicity and gender served as significant determinants for pretest scores, with a reduction in the gap between the scores of Hispanic and white students, albeit not eliminated even after adjustments for academic performance and family background factors."," The students from high schools that were sampled in the study lacked sufficient knowledge about economics to begin with.

The male students did better than female students by 3.5 percentage points (54.8% and 51.3% respectively). After examining the factors that contributed to the pretest scores, it was observed that ethnicity and gender played a significant role. The gap between the scores of Hispanic and white students was reduced, but not completely eliminated, after controlling for academic performance and family background characteristics."
" The gender disparities found in the pretest scores are thought-provoking. Although there is a small difference favoring males in the initial economic literacy, when taking into account the academic performance levels, the gap between males and females widens. It seems like females perform lower in economics than in other subjects. One possible reason for this could be the lack of early exposure to economic reasoning amongst young girls. Generally, the academic performance of students, like GPA or standardized mathematics and reading scores, plays a crucial role in pretest scores."," The differences in pretest scores between genders are intriguing. Although males have a slight advantage in initial economic literacy, the difference becomes more pronounced when academic performance is taken into account. Females appear to underperform in economics when compared to other subjects, which could be attributed to the lack of exposure to economic reasoning at an earlier age. Generally, pretest scores are significantly influenced by academic performance levels such as GPA and standardized mathematics and reading scores."," The pretest score gender disparities are quite interesting. Although there is a slight difference in favor of males in terms of initial economic literacy, the difference increases significantly when academic performance factors are considered. Females seem to perform worse in economics compared to other subjects, which could be ascribed to lesser exposure to economic reasoning during their early years. In general, academic performance has a significant impact on pretest scores, as demonstrated by factors such as GPA and standardized mathematics and reading scores."
" The analysis reveals that the quality of the instructors is a critical determinant of pupils' academic progress. It is documented that the effects of individual teachers are, in general, substantial and statistically significant. While it is possible that there exist unique student characteristics observable but unaccounted for that account for peer effects, the influence of teacher quality in student test scores changes cannot be understated."," The research findings demonstrate the significance of teacher excellence in shaping students' academic achievements. The outcomes show that there are substantial and statistically meaningful teacher-specific effects.

The research reveals that the effects of individual teachers are mostly significant and statistically noteworthy. While it cannot be entirely ruled out that there may be certain observable or unobservable student traits by classroom leading to peer effects, there is a firm belief that the quality of the teacher is of utmost importance in determining changes in students' test scores."
" Effective policy intervention according to the results should target specific ethnicities and genders. Improving economic literacy for Hispanics is linked with overall academic performance compared to whites. It is necessary to focus on improving learning opportunities in all subjects, including economics, at an early age to enhance the economic literacy of Hispanics. The difference in pretest scores between whites and Hispanics implies that early exposure to economic concepts may differ due to lower income and background characteristics. Furthermore, female students have less economic knowledge than male students at 12th grade, and this gap exists even when their overall academic performance is similar."," The findings suggest that specific intervention plans targeting certain ethnicities and genders are necessary for improving economic literacy. The results indicate that the academic performance of Hispanics compared to whites has a significant impact on their economic literacy. Therefore, enhancing learning opportunities in all subjects, including economics, at an early age could improve economic literacy for Hispanics. The difference in pretest scores between whites and Hispanics after controlling for academic performance characteristics might suggest variations in early access to economic concepts due to underlying income and community characteristics. Additionally, female students have lower economic knowledge relative to their male peers in 12th grade, regardless of their overall academic performance."," The results show the need for targeted policy interventions for specific ethnicities and genders to enhance economic literacy. The study suggests that economic literacy among Hispanics could benefit from improving overall academic performance relative to whites. To improve the economic literacy of Hispanics, it is essential to provide equal learning opportunities in all subjects, including economics, during early education. The white-Hispanic gap in pretest scores, after controlling for academic performance characteristics, implies a possible difference in early exposure to economic concepts, influenced by income and other socio-economic factors. Also, the female students' lower economic knowledge, even with similar academic performance, indicates a need for more attention to enhancing the economic literacy of female students."
" Based on our analysis of 12th graders' preliminary knowledge of economics, it appears that there remains room for improvement in fostering basic economic literacy throughout the K-11 school curriculum, although the study is geographically limited. Even though the California History/Social Science Standards have integrated an Economics Strand into the K-12 curriculum since 1998, necessitating the incorporation of essential economic principles and ways of thinking over an 11-year period culminating in a one-semester economics course during high school, it seems that economic literacy among young Californians is not particularly strong upon entering 12th grade. However, our research indicates that formal economic teaching during 12th grade does contribute to an improvement in students' economic literacy."," Drawing from our analysis of 12th graders' foundational knowledge of economics, we have found that more efforts are necessary throughout the K-11 school curriculum to cultivate basic economic literacy, although the study's area is limited. Despite the Economics Strand's inclusion in the California History/Social Science Standards across the K-12 program since 1998, which mandates introducing foundational economic concepts and the economic way of thinking over 11 years before high school graduation's one-semester economics course, our findings indicate that economic literacy among young Californians upon entering 12th grade is not robust enough. On the other hand, we observed that formal economic education in 12th grade does enhance students' economic literacy."," Our assessment of the entry-level economics knowledge of 12th graders suggests that more work is needed throughout the K-11 curriculum to build a basic understanding of economics, even though the study's geographical range is confined. Although the California History/Social Science Standards incorporated an Economics Strand into the K-12 curriculum in 1998, demanding that essential economic ideas and the economic way of thinking be infused throughout 11 years culminating in a one-semester economics course before high school graduation, we found that young Californians' economic literacy is not strong enough when they reach 12th grade. Nonetheless, we also observed that formal economic education in 12th grade improves students' economic literacy."
" Classical economists placed considerable emphasis on capital accumulation and growth.

" To fully comprehend the scope of economic evolution, it is necessary to take into account historical analysis as well. According to Smith, the study of history is essential to understanding the science of society and the human condition.

" Scientists seek to identify the mechanisms that create regularities between events and phenomena, as noted by Smith in his essay on the history of astronomy. Smith argues that the scientists' purpose is to uncover the ""connecting principles of nature"" or the ""invisible chains"" that link together different objects. In the Wealth of Nations, it is claimed that moral philosophy is the ""science that investigates and explains these connecting principles.""

" According to certain commentators, Smith's historical account should be viewed as a nomothetic approach to history rather than an idiographic one. This implies that history is not merely a narrative account of past events, but rather a systematic analysis of important themes beginning with a theoretical framework. As a consequence, Smith's historical discourse adopted a ""system-to-facts"" perspective, using historical evidence to substantiate his theory."," Some scholars suggest that Smith's historical account should be regarded as a nomothetic approach rather than an idiographic one.

" It has fascinated researchers focusing on Smith's work that he asserted in 1776 that the genuine trajectory of economic development in Europe was completely reversed, a statement that was quite striking. In fact, Smith devoted Book III's remaining chapters (chapters two to four) to explaining the causes of this deviation. As a result, some experts have argued that Smith was unable to reconcile his theoretical argument with historical experience."," Scholars have found it intriguing that Smith declared in 1776 that the actual path of economic growth in Europe was ""completely inverted,"" which was a very bold statement.

Some critics have since argued that Smith struggled to reconcile his theoretical argument with historical facts.", Researchers who have analyzed Smith's work have found it fascinating that he made the remarkable claim in 1776 that the actual course of economic growth in Europe was completely reversed. This led Smith to devote the remaining chapters (chapters two to four) of Book III to explaining why this divergence occurred. Some commentators have challenged Smith's ability to reconcile his theoretical argument with historical experience.
" Theoretical advancement described in the opening chapter of Book III is based on a specific economic theoretical model that supposes a number of institutional, legal, and political variables to be stationary, which is currently essential to observe for the intended purpose."," In order to fulfill the present objective, it is essential to note that the theoretical account of progress outlined in the first section of Book III is founded upon a certain type of economic theoretical model that has a series of institutional, legal, and political factors that are considered constant or presumed to be so."," It is pertinent to acknowledge, for the purpose at hand, that the theoretical narrative of progress presented in the initial chapter of Book III is established on a particular economic theoretical model which assumes a set of institutional, legal, and political conditions to be unchanging or taken for granted."
" Smith's theoretical history of economic progress encompasses a broader dimension. This dimension involves the application of the nomothetic mode, which is rooted in economic modeling, extended to a politico-economic model. This would enable the consideration of principles, such as the structure of legal rules and incentives of the polity, and their interaction with economic forces.

" Smith's definition of political economy does not limit itself to economic matters but recognizes the influence of political activities. He considered it to be a component of the statesman or legislator's field of knowledge or a theory of natural jurisprudence that may be referred to as the theory of the state. Natural jurisprudence aims to set out the general principles that should undergird the laws of nations, according to Smith (1759: 341)."," According to Smith, political economy is not exclusively concerned with economic issues, as it is also influenced by political activities.

" According to the observation made, Smith could have formulated a politico-economic model in economic history, in which Smith's theories of the state and positive economics play a role as sub-theories. Smith's historical account of Europe's progress demonstrates that the politico-economic model illustrates the relationship between the polity and the economy in the system. It also indicates that any governmental actions and legal institutions set up by public policy will undoubtedly influence economic performance, whether positively or negatively."," The findings suggest that Smith may have developed a politico-economic model in economic history, where his theories of the state and positive economics act as sub-theories. By analyzing the actual progress in Europe, Smith's historical account provides evidence that the politico-economic model signifies the connection between the polity and the economy within the system. Additionally, it emphasizes that governmental actions and legal institutions established through public policy will significantly impact economic performance, irrespective of whether it is advantageous or disadvantageous."," The observation made implies that Smith could have constructed a politico-economic model in economic history, where Smith's theories of the state and positive economics act as sub-theories, respectively.

" Smith's 1776 publication suggests that the desire for self-improvement or self-love is an integral and constant motivator for humans. This desire is present from birth until death, while being generally calm and rational in nature. According to Smith, this innate desire is the primary impetus for individual savings and broader capital accumulation, leading to greater national income and employment growth in the long run."," Adam Smith, in his book published in 1776, states that the principle of self-love, also known as a longing to improve oneself, is an inborn impulse that remains with humans throughout their life. Smith explains that this unemotional and rational instinct is what drives individuals to pursue personal savings, contributing to overall capital accumulation at the macro level. Over time, this accumulation leads to higher national income and employment rates."," In his 1776 publication, Adam Smith discusses the principle of self-love, which is the desire to improve one's condition, noting that it is a fundamental impulse in humans. This drive is present from the time of birth until the moment of death and is generally calm and rational in nature. Smith explains that this instinct is the engine driving individuals to practice personal savings, which contributes to capital accumulation at the aggregate level. In the end, this results in higher levels of national income and employment rates."
"Smith's analysis of economic history goes beyond economic factors and includes an evaluation of institutional aspects, including political regulations, contracts, and property rights, that are governed by the state. These human institutions serve as formal boundaries to daily interaction and play a crucial role in shaping human behavior. When structured in a just and appropriate manner, property rights and a sound polity can provide economic actors with security and encourage productive use of scarce resources."," Smith takes a comprehensive approach to economic history, considering institutional factors such as political regulations, property rights and enforcement mechanisms that are under state control. Human institutions that are managed by the state act as formal limitations on daily life and are fundamental to human interaction. A well-designed polity and structure of property rights can foster economic development by encouraging individuals to engage in productive activities and make better use of limited resources."," One important aspect of Smith's analysis of economic history is his inclusion of institutional factors, such as political regulations, property rights, and contracts that are enforced by the state.

" In order to evaluate the degree to which the institutional environment is accountable for worldwide discrepancies in economic growth and development, this research uses an innovative technique based on the institutions-augmented Solow model. The model is then used to estimate regression equations empirically. The study examines data from 180 countries between 1993 and 2012. The findings confirm that higher-quality institutional environments have a considerable positive influence on economic development, as demonstrated by all of the five institutional indicators - two economic freedom indices (Heritage Foundation and Fraser Institute), the governance indicator (World Bank), the democracy index (Freedom House), and the EBRD transition indicator for post-socialist countries. According to the study, discrepancies in human and physical capital and institutional environment account for around 70-75% of the world's differences in economic development. Nevertheless, the institutions-augmented Solow model has a weaker performance in comprehending differences in the pace of economic growth. Only one institutional variable (the index of economic freedom) has a significant effect on economic growth, according to the findings."," The aim of this study is to evaluate to what extent the institutional environment is responsible for dissimilarities in economic growth and development across the globe.

" The rate of economic growth and level of economic development are affected by diverse factors that are analyzed both from a theoretical and empirical perspective. These factors are broadly categorized into two main groups, i.e., the demand-side and supply-side determinants. Demand-side determinants comprise the elements of aggregate demand such as government expenditures, investment expenditures, and net exports. Consumption is not a self-determining factor and hence excluded. On the other hand, supply-side determinants comprise the variables, including technology, labour, human capital, and physical capital that can affect the potential output. Nonetheless, both demand-side and supply-side determinants can be sub-categorized, including various types of investments or government spending, along with other capital. These determinants are called direct because they promptly transform expenditures or inputs into output."," The pace of economic growth and degree of economic development depend on several factors analyzed by theoretical and empirical perspectives. These factors can be divided into two categories: demand-side and supply-side determinants. The demand-side group includes components of aggregate demand, such as investment expenditures, government spending on goods and services, and net exports. Consumption is not independent, so it is excluded. The supply-side determinants include variables like human capital, labor, technology, and physical capital that can influence potential output. Both determinants can be further broken down into various types of investments or government spending or capital. They are known as direct factors because they immediately transform inputs or expenditures into output."," The rate of economic growth and the level of economic development are influenced by various factors, which are analyzed through theoretical and empirical perspectives.

 Economic progress and development are reliant on both primary determinants as well as the underlying factors of production. These deep factors have a bearing on the primary determinants and thereby have an impact on macroeconomic outcomes. Institutional structures that aid in the interaction between output and measurable inputs are also considered deep determinants., The growth and development of an economy rely not only on direct determinants but also on underlying factors of production. These deep determinants affect the direct determinants and ultimately influence macroeconomic performance. Institutional frameworks that facilitate interactions between measurable inputs and output are regarded as deep determinants.," The economic progress and development of a nation is not only influenced by the direct determinants but also the underlying factors of production. These deep factors impact the direct determinants and hence have a bearing on the macroeconomic performance. Institution building is a critical deep determinant, as it enables the seamless interaction between measurable inputs and output to generate desired outcomes."
" The role that institutions play in economic growth and development is substantial. However, there are challenges that come with assessing the impact of institutions on economic growth, including identifying which institutions are the most essential growth factors and how to quantify them for empirical studies.

" Institutions serve as a broad term that encompasses a vast range of variables. There are countless ways to define institutions, as demonstrated by Sulejewicz's 2009 study. Institutions can be viewed as the rules of the game, whether upheld by legal requirements or voluntary social norms, or as strategies utilized by dominant groups. Some institutions are informal, such as trust and loyalty, while others require coordination by lawmakers, such as limited liability corporations. Markets, in particular, require a complex system of institutions to function, including property rights, regulatory institutions overseeing industries such as goods, services, labor, assets, and financial markets, fiscal and monetary institutions, institutions for social insurance, and measures for conflict management. The latter includes the rule of law, high-quality judicial systems, representative political institutions, free and fair elections, independent labor unions, social partnerships, and representation of minority groups, as Rodrik noted in 2007."," When discussing institutions, it is essential to recognize the breadth of the term. Sulejewicz's 2009 analysis shows multiple variables used to describe different types of institutions. Persson believes that institutions represent the rules of the game, with some enforced by legal policies while others rely on voluntary agreement or influence from wealthy or powerful people. Certain institutions, such as trust and commitment, function informally, while others, like limited liability corporations, require legislative approval. The various institutions required to support functioning markets are numerous and demanding, presenting challenges for governments seeking to create a stable business environment. Institutions including property rights, regulatory institutions, fiscal and monetary policies, social insurance, and conflict management mechanisms are all critical to shaping markets. Rodrik in 2007 identified several institutions that are needed to stabilize markets, including the rule of law, impartial courts, fair electoral processes, autonomous labor unions, partnership with social entities, and minority representation."," The definition of institutions is broad, and there are countless variables that describe this term.

" The augmented Solow model suggests that both institutions and usual factors have an impact on economic growth, which is demonstrated by Equation (21). Economic growth will be higher with better institutions. By employing linear regression, it is possible to gauge the effect of institutions on economic growth empirically, but certain assumptions regarding the regression model and estimation techniques must be applied. The researchers Bia?owolski, Kuszewski, and Witkowski [2010] assume that all the relationships in macroeconomics are linear."," Economic growth is determined by both institutions and standard factors in accordance with the institutions-augmented Solow model, which Equation (21) illustrates. The quality of institutions is directly proportional to the rapidity of economic growth. Estimating the impact of institutions on economic growth empirically is possible by using linear regression to analyze Equation (21). Of course, some assumptions concerning the regression model's specification and estimation methods must be imposed, such as the assumption of all macroeconomic relationships being linear by Bia?owolski, Kuszewski, and Witkowski [2010]."," Based on the institutions-augmented Solow model, Equation (21) reveals that economic growth is reliant on both institutions and standard factors.

" There are alternative methods for identifying the variables that impact economic growth, and not just through the estimation of regression equations. One of these methods is growth accounting, which is an empirical exercise that calculates how much economic growth is caused by measurable factor inputs and technological changes. The residual portion of economic growth, which is called the Solow residual, is taken as a proxy of technical progress or total factor productivity. The growth accounting method cannot differentiate the contribution of institutions from other factors. The estimation of the regression equation and growth accounting follow different econometric methodologies, so we cannot compare these two methods directly. For more information on growth accounting exercises, check out studies by Rapacki and Pr¨®chniak [2006]."," Aside from estimating regression equations, there exist other means of identifying the factors that influence economic growth. One such approach is growth accounting, which involves an analytical exercise dedicated to estimating the impact of measurable factor inputs and technological changes on economic growth. The Solow residual, or the portion of economic growth that cannot be attributed to these measurable factors, serves as a proxy for technical progress or total factor productivity. However, growth accounting is unable to distinguish the contribution of institutions from that of other factors. Due to the disparity in their econometric methodologies, it is difficult to compare the estimation of regression equations to growth accounting. For further information on growth accounting exercises, consider examining studies by Rapacki and Pr¨®chniak [2006]."," It is not just through regression equations that we can identify the variables affecting economic growth. Growth accounting is an empirical exercise that can be used for this purpose, where the goal is to calculate the amount of economic growth that can be attributed to measurable factors such as labor, physical capital or human capital, as well as the level of technology. The Solow residual, which is the portion of economic growth not explained by these factors, is used as a measure of technical progress or total factor productivity. However, it is not possible to determine which part of the Solow residual is due to institutions versus other elements via growth accounting. Because of their different econometric methodologies, we cannot directly compare the estimation of the regression equation with growth accounting. To learn more about growth accounting, it is recommended to review studies conducted by Rapacki and Pr¨®chniak [2006]."

" Table 2 data shows that the institutions-augmented Solow model is highly effective in explaining income level differences across the world. Regardless of the institutional indicator used, all regression equations had high R-squares, and estimated coefficients were consistent with theoretical analysis and expectations. For instance, variant A revealed that physical capital accumulation, human capital accumulation, population growth, and economic freedom (measured by the Heritage Foundation index) explain approximately 75% of global economic development disparities, with all variables being statistically significant except for population growth, which had a positive sign despite contradicting theory. Switching to the Fraser Institute's economic freedom index as the institutional indicator yielded comparable outcomes, with physical capital becoming insignificant while human capital and institutions remained significant. Variant C, which used the World Bank's world governance indicator as the institutional variable, produced similar results to variant B except that physical capital was entirely insignificant."," According to the data in Table 2, the institutions-augmented Solow model is extremely successful in explaining economic disparities across the globe. Irrespective of the institutional indicator, all regression equations had high R-squares, and the estimated coefficients were consistent with the theoretical analysis and expectations.

" Theoretical analysis suggests that there is a negative link between the rate of economic growth and the initial GDP per capita level, supporting the idea of convergence. The catching-up effect facilitates income equality among nations. Additionally, physical capital, human capital accumulation, and institutional factors are positive indicators of economic growth. Conversely, population growth has a negative correlation with output dynamics."," The relationship between the rate of economic growth and the initial GDP per capita level is negative based on theoretical analysis, indicating the existence of convergence. The catching-up effect that occurs leads to a decrease in income differences between countries, contributing to income equality.

However, population growth has a rather adverse relationship with output dynamics."
" The Solow model extended for institutional variables outperforms differences in economic growth rates in explaining global differences in economic development. This is due to the fact that institutional variables, investment rates, and human capital accumulation, impacting potential output in a significant way, relate to the supply side of the economy. Meanwhile, economic growth rates are influenced mainly by many demand-side factors, and other forces which do not reflect fluctuations in potential output. Institutional variables have long-lasting effects on economic development, resulting from the long-term behavior of a given economy that institutional variables can explain. At the same time, economic growth rates do not reveal long-run tendencies. Therefore, institutional variables may provide a weak explanation."," The Solow model augmented with institutional variables is a better way of explaining differences in economic development worldwide than differences in economic growth rates. This is because variables like institutional environment, investment rates, and human capital accumulation, which fall under the input category, are associated with the economy's supply side and have a profound influence on potential output. In contrast, economic growth rates are a product of various demand-side factors and external variables that do not reflect the changes in potential output. Institutional variables have an extended impact on economic development primarily due to the behavior of a given economy over the long term that they can explain. Conversely, economic growth rates cannot show long-term tendencies. Hence, the Solow model extended for institutional variables is a better explanation of the differences in economic development than GDP growth rates."," The institution-augmented Solow model is a more effective tool for explaining differences in worldwide economic development than the dissimilarities in economic growth rates. This is because variables like investment rates, institutional environment, and human capital accumulation related to inputs, impact the supply-side of the economy and hold a significant power of influencing potential output. Conversely, numerous demand-side factors and other external variables impact economic growth rates, which do not effectively reflect fluctuations in potential output. Institutional variables have long-term effects on economic development, as it results from the long-term behavior of an economy that institutional factors can explain. Besides, GDP growth rates fail to reveal long-run tendencies, which suggests that institutional variables may provide a weak explanation. Therefore, the institution-augmented Solow model is better suited to explain differences in economic development than differences in GDP growth rates."
" When interpreting the results, it is assumed that past values of explanatory variables impact the current state of development, however, several macroeconomic relationships exist due to mutual causality triggered by the endogenous nature of some variables. For example, rich countries may have more opportunities to save, invest in human capital, and have favorable regulations and institutions simply because they are wealthy. To explore endogeneity, it is required to conduct a more comprehensive analysis using advanced econometric techniques, which might be an appropriate topic for further research."," The interpretation of results presumes that the past explanatory variables affect the current level of economic development. However, mutual causality characterizes several macroeconomic relations, and this is partly attributable to the endogenous character of some variables. Wealthy countries could enjoy greater opportunities to save, invest in human capital, and benefit from favorable regulations and institutions due to their wealth. However, an endogenous approach would require more extensive analysis and the adoption of more advanced econometric methods, which could be the subject of further investigation."," In interpreting the results, it is assumed that the past explanatory variables have a causal relationship with the current stage of economic development. However, several macroeconomic relationships have mutual causality, which is caused in part by some variables' endogenous nature. For instance, richer countries may have more exceptional opportunities for saving, investing in human capital, and benefiting from regulations and institutions that support their economic growth. Further research would require a more in-depth analysis and more advanced econometric techniques to study the endogenous approach effectively."
" The above equations provide slightly contradictory outputs. The first one highlights the important role of human capital in economic development, whereas the latter assigns more value to physical capital growth. This could be due to the fact that the former equation was derived from the determinants of economic development, wherein human capital serves as a significant factor. Economic advancement is an outcome of long-term economic growth, which is majorly influenced by how much human capital has been accumulated over the past few decades. Therefore, nations that possess an abundance of human capital tend to achieve higher levels of economic development."," The formulas above appear to produce slightly inconsistent outcomes. While the first one underscores the critical role played by human capital in driving economic growth, the second formula places greater emphasis on the accumulation of physical capital. This apparent contradiction could be explained by the fact that the first formula was established based on the determinants of economic development, which highlights the centrality of human capital. The level of economic well-being is ultimately a product of long-term economic growth, which is closely tied to the extent of human capital accumulation over the preceding decades. For this reason, countries that have ample human capital tend to achieve higher levels of economic development."," The above equations seem to present slightly contradictory findings. The first formula emphasizes the crucial role of human capital in the process of economic development, while the latter assigns greater importance to physical capital accumulation. However, this discrepancy could be due to the first equation being derived from the determinants of economic development, where human capital plays a more significant role. Economic well-being is primarily the result of the long-term growth process, which largely depends on the accumulation of human capital over the past few decades. Hence, countries with abundant human capital tend to achieve higher levels of economic development."
" In the context of medium-term economic growth, physical capital plays a more critical role compared to human capital. Investment in physical capital leads to immediate acceleration of economic growth, while the effects of human capital accumulation take a longer time to manifest. Therefore, physical capital is considered to be a more significant factor in the process of economic growth. This view is also supported by some models of economic growth such as the Uzawa-Lucas model, which suggests that the pace of economic development of a given developing country depends on whether the country is lagging in physical capital or human capital."," When it comes to medium-term economic growth, physical capital tends to be more crucial than human capital. Investing in physical capital assists in immediately boosting economic growth, while the effects of human capital accumulation take longer to become apparent. As a result, physical capital is considered to be a more significant variable in the process of economic growth. This perspective is supported by some models of economic growth, such as the Uzawa-Lucas model, which suggests that the pace of economic growth of a developing country largely depends on whether the country is deficient in physical capital or human capital."," In medium-term economic growth, physical capital appears to play a more significant role than human capital. Investing in physical capital results in an immediate acceleration of economic growth, while the effects of human capital accumulation take a longer time to materialize. Therefore, physical capital is deemed a more critical factor in the process of economic growth. This viewpoint is also supported by some models of economic growth, including the Uzawa-Lucas model. This model posits that the pace of economic growth in a developing country primarily depends on whether the nation lags in physical capital or human capital."

" In our research, we delved into the concept of an economic man, which holds a prominent role in economic ethics. Our primary focus was to understand the economic behavior of people and to explore the hypotheses made by traditional economics around the economic man. We were guided by the Christian economic man models of M. Weber and S. N. Bulgakov in our examination of business ethics and economic ethics. Instead of exploring multiple pathways, we focused on Weber and Bulgakov's characterization of economic man to scrutinize the hypothesis of a rational economic man. Besides, we debated the arguments made by L. von Mises and A. Sen on the nature of an economic man's freedom and personality. One of the critical issues scholars studying business ethics and economic ethics must tackle is how to blend the egoism and altruism found in an economic man's heart to create more altruistic economic agents."," Our study delved into the concept of an economic man, which plays a significant role in economic ethics.

Additionally, we discussed the claims made by L. von Mises and A. Sen on the essence of an economic man's freedom and innermost being. Scholars interested in economic ethics and business ethics must address the issue of reconciling altruism and egoism commonly inherent in the heart of an economic man to generate more altruistic economic individuals."," Our study examined the idea of an economic man as a central figure in economic ethics, with a focus on understanding human behavior in economic situations and exploring the hypotheses around the economic man in traditional economics.

Instead of exploring other channels, we investigated L. von Mises's and A. Sen's contentions on the substantive freedom and internal makeup of an economic man. Scholars of business ethics and economic ethics must explore how to reconcile egotism and altruism that coexist in the hearts of economic agents to drive more altruistic economic behavior."
" In the late 1800s, China faced the challenge of the capitalist powers of Europe and America and the influence of Western civilization. When China was unable to counter Western military power in the form of ships and guns, it began to take note of the advantages of laws and institutions in Western capitalist countries. This led to a realization of how these changes would impact China's cultural heritage and civilization. To reconcile Confucianism with the demands of capitalism and democracy, Neo-Confucianism reimagined the traditional concept of 'external enrichment.' Likewise, those who sought to westernize Russia in the early 1900s faced challenges in reconciling the inherent culture of Russia with Western civilization. As Russia moves into the 21st century with a 'westernized' capitalist market economy, the challenges of promoting a mature democracy and reconciling Western civilization with Russian culture remain to be fully addressed.

" Bulgakov was raised as an Orthodox Christian in a family of Russian Orthodox priests. However, in high school, he turned into an atheist and a Marxist, becoming a known specialist of Marxism with the publication of his monograph on ""Production in a Capitalist Market"" in 1896.

This led to the publication of his Master's thesis on ""Capitalism and Agriculture,"" which explored the contradiction between the rule of concentrated production and rural production. Bulgakov then underwent a transformation, embracing the belief that human life and society were built on absolute values such as truth, goodness, and beauty, and published ""From Marxism to Idealism"" in 1903 to explain his ideological shift.

" Bulgakov delved into the concept of a human-like deity and examined fake Christianity in both materialistic atheism and Marx's socialism. He drew parallels between the predictions for socialism's rise and the destiny of capitalism with the end times prophecies in Christian theology. He likened the proletariat to God's chosen people and assigned them with specific callings, while portraying capital as Satan. In his essays, 'Pristine Christianity and Last Socialism' and 'Apocalypse and Socialism,' written in 1909 and 1910 respectively, Bulgakov discussed these ideas in-depth (Lossky 1952, pp. 200¨C202). Bulgakov argued that Marx's socialism, which was labeled an atheist pseudo-religion, was centered around a self-righteous man-God. This man-God portrayed himself to be like Christ or a saint and was hostile to Christianity and God-man saints. However, this portrayal differed from that of Christian economic man, who had a unique personality and soul, according to Bulgakov's ethical beliefs."," Bulgakov continued to explore the idea of man having divine qualities and scrutinized the properties of pseudo-Christianity, particularly in materialistic atheism and Marx's socialism.

Similarly, he equated the proletariat with God's chosen people, possessing specific vocations, while capital symbolized Satan's power.

" The dissertation titled 'The World as Household' by Bulgakov explored the human behavior in an economic context, in addition to the idea of an economic man.

In a Christian perspective, rebirth and immortality enabled a person to continue consuming in the realistic world.

" Christianity values the idea of human freedom, and this is upheld in various divisions such as Catholicism, Protestantism, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Whenever the concept of human freedom is discussed, questions like 'Who is man?' and 'What is the relationship between man and God?' often arise. Christianity uses 'Imago Dei' from the book of Genesis in the Old Testament to explain who man is, where human characteristics such as free will, morality, and rationale are used to describe man's image of God and the unique relationship that exists between God and man. Karl Rahner, a Catholic theologian, believes that man is the recipient of the Word of God, 'Ho ?rer des Wortes,' which explains the link between God and man. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether man's mirror image of God, which was harmed by Adam, can be recovered through salvation or whether it emerged after Original Sin with some parts unaffected and others damaged."," The concept of human freedom holds great significance in Christianity and its various factions like Catholicism, Protestantism, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. The idea of 'who is man?' and 'what is the relationship between man and God?' is brought up when discussing human freedom. Christianity explains who man is using 'Imago Dei' from the Old Testament's Genesis, where human qualities like morality, free will, and rationale are utilized to describe man's similarity to God and the exceptional connection between them. Karl Rahner, a Catholic theologian, identifies man as the recipient of the Word of God, 'Ho ?rer des Wortes,' to define the relationship between God and humans. Whether human's mirror image of God, which was damaged by Adam's actions, can only be restored through salvation or if it emerged after the Original Sin with some parts damaged and others intact remains unclear."," The idea of human freedom is highly respected in Christianity and among its different sectors, including Catholicism, Protestantism, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Whenever human freedom is discussed, questions arise about 'who is man?' and 'what is the relationship between man and God?' 'Imago Dei' from the Old Testament's Genesis is used to explain who man is in Christianity. This term describes man's inherent characteristics such as free will, morality, and rationale, which reflect God's image and the unique relationship between man and his creator. Karl Rahner, a Catholic theologian, portrays man as the recipient of the Word of God, 'Ho ?rer des Wortes,' to depict the relationship between man and God. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether man's mirror image of God, which was destroyed by Adam, can only be restored through salvation or if the mirror image of God came into being after the Original Sin, with some parts of it remaining unharmed and some parts damaged."
" Luther emphasized the importance of faith when faced with limited freedom and uncertainty. Having faith allows Christians to believe in their own salvation and pursue their goals without coercion or pressure to perform sacred deeds for the sole purpose of pleasing God or gaining recognition from Him. Those who lack faith are seen as troubled and unhappy. Thus, salvation can only be achieved by wholeheartedly waiting for God and fully trusting Him while abandoning self-directed activities. It is only after redemption that man can be truly free to serve God. (Althaus and Schultz 1972, pp. 37-39; p. 55; Brendler 1991; Hummel 2003)."," In the face of uncertainty and limited freedom, Luther stressed the importance of faith. Christians who have faith believe in their own salvation and can pursue their goals without feeling coerced to perform sacred acts solely for the purpose of pleasing God or gaining His recognition. In contrast, those without faith are viewed as troubled and unhappy. As a result, salvation can only be attained through complete trust in God and wholeheartedly waiting for Him, while abandoning self-directed activities. Only after being redeemed can one be truly free to serve God. (Althaus and Schultz 1972, pp. 37¨C39; p. 55; Brendler 1991; Hummel 2003)."," Luther placed great emphasis on the value of faith amid circumstances of uncertainty and limited freedom. Christians who possess faith can believe in their own salvation and carry out their tasks without any compulsion to perform sacred deeds only to please or gain recognition from God.

" The distinctiveness of Eastern Orthodox Theology lies in the idea that the Western Church has adopted many Christian religious customs and beliefs from the East, since the origin of Christianity is primarily located in the East. Moreover, Orthodox theologians maintain that the Greek language effectively articulates Christian doctrines, whereas Latin language is inadequate to precisely communicate the nuanced variations within Greek theology.", One of the key aspects of Eastern Orthodox Theology is the focus on the Eastern roots of Christian religious practices and beliefs. This is because a large number of the earliest churches were located in the East. The Greek language is seen as being more precise in expressing Christian doctrine and Orthodox theologians believe that Latin terminology does not capture the subtle differences in concepts conveyed in Greek theology.," Eastern Orthodox Theology stands out by highlighting the Eastern heritage of Christian religious rites and beliefs. This is because a significant number of the earliest churches were based in the East. Additionally, Orthodox theologians argue that the Greek language is best suited to express the nuances of Christian doctrine, while Latin terminology is unable to convey the intricate differences in concepts that are present within Greek theology."
"Sen's economic development theory centers around the connection between human freedom and advancement. As per Sen, genuine liberation empowers people to realize their abilities and improve their skills to secure a place in a profession or social group, such as doctors, soldiers, volunteers, etc. Sen refers to this standing as 'being,' which varies from Weber's religious ideas of 'calling' or 'Beruf.' Weber put forth that Calvinist Puritans aimed to become Berufsmenschen by following austerity and reforming the world to serve God's kingdom. Weber believed that capitalists could efficiently use the productivity of voluntary workers to boost labor productivity. However, with the ascent of capitalism and the replacement of human workers with machines, the ascetic practices of the Beruf concept declined while wealth acquisition grew in importance, devoid of any religious or moral implications. Thus, the Beruf concept that gave birth to capitalism faced its demise because of its replacement by capitalism."," The theory of economic development proposed by Sen establishes a direct relationship between human freedom and advancement. Sen believes that human beings can reach their full potential and develop their abilities once they possess true freedom. The development of these talents and abilities enables individuals to achieve a certain standing, profession or status within society, such as doctors, soldiers or volunteers, which Sen terms as 'being.' This concept differs from Weber's religious notions of 'calling' or 'Beruf.' Weber argued that Calvinist Puritans sought to become Berufsmenschen, who, through austerity and reform, answered God's calling and worked for the Kingdom of God. Weber further believed that capitalists could exploit the voluntary productivity of workers to achieve the highest possible labor force productivity. However, with the emergence of capitalism and the replacement of human labor with machines, the idea of Beruf slowly collapsed, with a focus on wealth acquisition, divorced from spiritual and ethical considerations. As a result, the Beruf concept that gave birth to capitalism eventually lost its relevance in post-Enlightenment society."," Sen's theory of economic development explores the link between human freedom and progress. According to Sen, once an individual discovers true freedom, they can unlock their potential and utilize their skills to become a member of a particular profession, group, or social status such as doctors, soldiers, volunteers, and more. Sen defines this status and identity as 'being,' which differs from Weber's religious interpretation of 'calling' or 'Beruf.' Weber established that Calvinist Puritans aimed to become Berufsmenschen by following asceticism and reforming the world to serve God's kingdom. In addition to this, Weber believed that when an employer has highly productive voluntary workers at their disposal, they can utilize capitalist 'labor productivity' effectively. However, the concept of Beruf lost its spiritual significance and transformed into wealth acquisition and economic motives when asceticism gave birth to capitalism, and the Enlightenment embraced capitalistic ideals. As a result, the concept of Beruf slowly declined, eventually losing its power to influence society in capitalist societies."
"Bulgakov believed that man was essential to the creation of the economic world and viewed him as the Logos. He believed that an individual's asceticism and dedication to their profession had a significant impact on the world. Hence, he suggested that merging a person's role as a Logos in the economic world with asceticism could improve labor productivity. Bulgakov's concept of 'homo economicus' differed from Calvinist's 'Berufsmensch' in that the former had an ascetic nature and only existed as an identity of Logos. The 'Berufsmensch,' on the other hand, saw his work as a lifelong mission from God and believed that his diligence and dedication would earn him eternal life. By collaborating with the Holy Spirit to deify the world, man played a crucial role in governing it after its creation.","According to Bulgakov, man played a central role in creating the economic world, and he believed that man was the Logos. Bulgakov proposed that asceticism, which is one of the hallmarks of Christian religion, and the Logos man played could be merged to create a new economic man. This new breed of worker was motivated by labor mechanisms that led to an increase in productivity. In contrast to the Calvinist 'Berufsmensch,' Bulgakov's 'homo economicus' was an ascetic entity that existed only as an identity of the Logos. Meanwhile, the 'Berufsmensch' considered his work a calling and saw it as a lifetime mission from God. Through the collaboration and bond between man and the Holy Spirit, the world could achieve deification, and man would take an active role in governing the world after Creation.","Bulgakov, who believed that man was the creator and Logos of the economic world, proposed merging the concepts of asceticism and the role of man as the Logos. This blend led to the emergence of a new 'homo economicus' who was motivated by a new labor mechanism, which increased productivity. In contrast to the Calvinist 'Berufsmensch' who saw himself as the chosen one, believing that his work was a calling that God bestowed upon him, Bulgakov's 'homo economicus' only existed as a Logos identity with an ascetic nature. The man collaborated with the Holy Spirit to deify the world and governed it after Creation through the sacrament of God. In conclusion, the distinction between the two concepts was evident, and man's cooperation with God played a significant role in the world's progress."
" The idea of the new economic man in Eastern Orthodox beliefs describes humans as the Logos of the economic world. Their role, assigned by God, is to govern and create while possessing labor rights and obligations that contribute to the mission of world divinization. This perspective deems ""instrumental freedoms,"" which enable economic convenience, as well as basic human rights and economic rights for free trade in the market, beneficial. If the Russian government adopts Sen's five ""instrumental freedoms"" to develop a suitable environment and maintain freedom, this can positively impact the country's overall economic development."," In the concept of the new economic man in Eastern Orthodoxy, humans are viewed as the Logos of the economic world.

"The connection between human economic behavior and an economic system was explored through an analysis of Bulgakov's Christian economic man, which was further supported by Sen's arguments. Other topics examined included human freedom in theology, God's calling to humans, predestination, justification, mysticism, deification and economic ethics within a specific economic system.

" Bulgakov's rejection of Marxism was reflected in his statements on the concept of the economic man during 1903-1911. His later works, such as 'Philosophy of Economy', and other essays drew inspiration from Weber's concept of a Christian economic man. Bulgakov explored the idea of Christian economic men from various denominations, including Catholicism, Orthodox Church, Puritan, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Quakers.

" Von Mises's explanation of a human being's economic behavior is more holistic and includes not only the rational and self-interest qualities of the standard economic man, but also their innermost being or soul, which is highlighted in his analysis of free will in Chapter 3 and economic behavior in Chapter 1 (von Mises, 2006). This aspect is crucial for a comprehensive comprehension of economic behavior. Bulgakov's Christian economic man and Weber's man driven by their vocation, known as the Calvinist economic man according to Bulgakov, are analogous to von Mises's economic man in terms of incorporating spiritual elements in the analysis."," Despite Sen's attempts to move the economic man from a rational and self-interested being to a liberated economic man, his work does not delve into the soul or innermost essence of an economic man, as detailed in von Mises's analysis of human economic behavior in Chapter 1 and free will in Chapter 3, which is a vital attribute in examining economic behavior (von Mises, 2006). Conversely, von Mises's depiction of the economic man is more akin to Bulgakov's Christian economic man and Weber's individual who labors with a defined purpose and is regarded as a Calvinist economic man."," von Mises's approach to analyzing a human being's economic actions encompasses not just the rational and self-interested aspects of the typical economic man, but also includes their innermost being or soul, which is highlighted in his examination of free will in Chapter 3 and economic behavior in Chapter 1, and is a key aspect of comprehending economic behavior (von Mises, 2006). The spiritual component of economic behavior is illustrated further by Bulgakov's Christian economic man and Weber's man who strives for a specific purpose in their work, known as the Calvinist economic man from Bulgakov's perspective, and is consistent with von Mises's depiction of the economic man."
" The relationship between religious ethics and an economic man in an economic system has been a focus of both Bulgakov and Weber. Weber gave importance to the effects of Calvinist economic ethics on an economic man, and Bulgakov went on to explain the concept of an economic man in Christianity. Moreover, both authors have emphasized the soulless existence of economic man. Bulgakov argued that a materialist economic man in Marxism would have no soul, while Weber stated that many people working in the last stage of capitalism had lost their Protestant ethics and became soulless."," The correlation between an economic system, an economic man, and religious ethics has attracted significant attention from both Bulgakov and Weber. While Weber placed emphasis on the impact of Calvinist economic ethics on the economic man, Bulgakov expanded the concept to include an economic man within Christianity. They both referred to the idea of a soulless economic man, with Bulgakov contending that a materialistic economic man in Marxism would lack a soul, and Weber arguing that in the final stage of capitalism, only soulless individuals, having abandoned Protestant ethics, would work in a calling or profession."," The concept of an economic man in an economic system and its relationship with religious ethics is a topic that has garnered much attention from Bulgakov and Weber.

" The question of computation and calculation is of utmost importance in the context of the economic system. The economic calculation problem has a direct impact on institutional settlements and policies. Various institutional structures can serve as obstacles to achieving rational allocation of resources through economic calculation. For this reason, the outcome of the economic calculation debate carries significant weight. When experts like economists and philosophers define institutions and policies, they must take into account the possibility of computation and calculation in an economic system."," The ability to perform computation and calculation in economic systems is highly practical and essential. Institutional settlements and policies are significantly influenced by the economic calculation problem. Various institutional structures can potentially limit the possibility of economic calculation and result in irrational resource allocation. The outcome of the economic calculation debate is critical from this perspective. Therefore, when economists and philosophers design institutions and policies, they must take into consideration the ability to perform computation and calculation within an economic system."," The practical significance of computation and calculation in the economic system is immense. The economic calculation problem has a crucial impact on institutional settlements and policies. Different institutional settings can pose hindrances to economic calculation, leading to irrational allocation of resources. Hence, it is crucial to consider the conclusions of the economic calculation debate. When economists and philosophers outline institutions and policies, they must recognize the importance of computation and calculation in an economic system to make informed decisions."
"Computability theory is concerned with whether economic issues can be resolved through it. We tend to think that modern computing devices have boundless power for calculation and that they can solve any problem if given enough resources and time, including economic problems."," In economic theory, computability focuses on whether the problems at hand can be addressed using principles of computability. Given the seemingly infinite capacity of modern computing devices for computation, it is sometimes assumed that any problem can be solved with adequate time and resources, including the economic problem."," Computability theory in economics deals with the feasibility of solving economic problems using computability principles. Although modern computers have seemingly limitless calculation abilities, we cannot always assume that economic problems can be solved with sufficient resources and time, despite their vast computational capacity."
" The issue we refer to as the economic problem pertains to how resources ought to be rationally allocated in an economic system. This dilemma is prevalent among all individuals, even those leading self-sufficient lifestyles, as the number of needs and wants generally exceed the available resources at hand. The most compelling instance of this issue is that of time. Since time is scarce for all of us, it's crucial to allocate it in a manner that prioritizes the importance of our objectives."," The economic quandary at hand deals with the wise allocation of resources within an economic framework. This perplexity is ubiquitous among all people, irrespective of whether they lead self-sufficient lives or not, as demands and necessities usually outnumber available resources. The issue of the judicious allocation of time provides an excellent example of this predicament, as this limited resource must be allocated according to the essential goals one has set."," The economic problem necessitates the rational allocation of resources within an economic system. Each individual, regardless of their self-sustaining lifestyle, must grapple with this issue because requirements and desires are often in higher demand than the resources available. The most noteworthy example of this is the management of time, which is a scarce resource. Allocating time in a rational manner means prioritizing objectives based on their importance."
" Von Mises contends that economic calculation remains impossible in an economic system based on collective property, despite the availability of all relevant information to the planner. He assumes that the planner is equipped with complete technological know-how of their current time and has a full inventory of production factors, and various experts have furnished them with exhaustive reports. Furthermore, all individuals in society have agreed to common ends. Yet, the planner still faces a conundrum - the infinite range of means and projects at their disposal renders it almost impossible to determine the most efficient way to fulfill the common ends. For example, building a house requires choosing from multiple methods, each with varied advantages and disadvantages, such as production time, resource consumption, and quality of materials. The planner must weigh and evaluate disparate variables such as labor, tool productivity, and resource consumption to determine the optimal approach, making it an almost impossible task."," Von Mises makes a proposition that economic calculation is impossible in an economic system founded on collective property, regardless of whether the planner has access to all the pertinent information. He supposes that the planner is equipped with complete technological knowledge of the time and has an inventory of all production factors, along with exhaustive information reports from multiple experts. Additionally, all members of society have agreed upon common ends. Yet the planner still encounters a seeming insurmountable obstacle - the abundance of means and projects at their disposal can make choosing the most effective way to fulfill the common objectives impossible. What's more, building a house, for instance, necessitates picking from numerous methods, each with its set of benefits and drawbacks in terms of material quality, production time, and resource consumption. It is imperative to weigh various variables such as labor, tool productivity, and resource consumption to come to an optimal conclusion, a near-impossible feat."," Von Mises argues that economic calculation is unfeasible in an economic system anchored in collective ownership, despite the planner's possession of all relevant information. He assumes that the planner has complete technological expertise of the period and an inventory of all production factors, in addition to exhaustive data from experts, while all the individuals in society have agreed upon common objectives. Nonetheless, the planner faces a daunting task - the immense pool of means and projects available renders selecting the most efficient way to achieve the common objectives practically impossible. Take the example of constructing a house - the planner must choose from an array of methods, each with its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of factors such as production time, material quality, and resource consumption. One must weigh variables such as labor, tool efficiency, and resource consumption to arrive at an optimal conclusion, which is an immensely complex undertaking."
" In a sophisticated economy, the production techniques are exceptionally diverse. The ways of production are not wholly specific nor wholly non-specific. If every technique of production were one or the other, then determining the mode of production and the techniques to be used would be purely a technological problem instead of an economic one. Even in a simple economy, making a wise selection between heterogeneous methods and ways of production would be possible only within certain constraints. In a complex economy, the primary challenge does not involve deciding on the final goods to be produced. Even in a socialist economy, this is a lesser issue. It can be roughly established whether 1,000 hl of wine is preferable to 800 hl of wine or whether 1,000 hl of oil is better than 500 hl of oil. After this resolution is reached, the real, unsolvable difficulty (for a planned economy) arises, which is choosing the most efficient ways and techniques of production to achieve the desired ends (von Mises, 1990, p. 13, 207-8)."," A complex economy is characterized by an extensive range of production methods. The production means are neither entirely specific nor entirely non-specific. If every production means falls into one of these two categories, the decision about the method of production and the means to be used would be a technological problem rather than an economic problem. Even in a simple economy, choosing between diverse production means and methods has some limitations. In a complex economy, the main challenge is not determining which goods to produce. In a socialist economy, this problem is relatively uncomplicated. Deciding whether 1,000 hl of wine is better than 800 hl of wine or if 1,000 hl of oil is superior to 500 hl of oil can be approximately agreed on. However, the actual difficulty, which is unsolvable for a planned economy, materializes when choosing the most advantageous production means and techniques to achieve the desired goals (von Mises, 1998, pp. 207-8, 13)."," An intricate economy consists of a wide variety of production methods. The production means are not entirely specific or entirely non-specific. If every means of production were merely one of the two, deciding on the production method and means would be a technological issue rather than an economic one. Even in a simple economy, picking between diverse production methods and means has some limitations. In a complex economy, the primary challenge does not lie in choosing which goods to produce. In a socialist economy, this issue is not very complicated. Ultimately, it can be decided if 1,000 hl of wine is better than 800 hl of wine, or if 1,000 hl of oil is optimum compared to 500 hl of oil. Nonetheless, the actual difficulty that cannot be resolved in a planned economy emerges while selecting the most beneficial means and production methods to fulfill the objectives (von Mises, 1998, pp. 207-8, 13)."
" Market prices play a crucial role as they enable rational decision-making when it comes to choosing the best production means and methods from a wide range of available options. This is fulfilled by monetary calculation based on market prices which are created within a private property system, where entrepreneurs require goods and bid for them, be it intermediate ones or final products. This, in essence, is regarded as the ultimate solution to the economic challenge of resource allocation."," The value of market prices can't be understated since they enable logical decision-making when it comes to picking the best production means and approaches from a wide array of choices available. This is made possible via monetary calculation which relies on market prices created within a private property system, where entrepreneurs are in charge of bidding for the goods they require, be it intermediate or final ones. In a nutshell, this approach is viewed as the ultimate solution to the economic problem of resource allocation."," Market prices hold significant importance as they enable comprehensive decision-making when it comes to choosing the ideal production methods and means from numerous options available. This is executed via monetary calculation that relies on the market prices formed within a private ownership system, where entrepreneurs compete to bid for the goods they require, whether intermediate or final products. Ultimately, this framework is deemed as the ultimate resolution to the economic dilemma of resource allocation."
" Both Abba Lerner and Oskar Lange acknowledged the importance of market prices in economic calculation, while questioning the necessity of a free market based on private property to achieve such calculation. They argued that planners can replicate any market outcome, making the notion of private property redundant in this regard. In support of market socialism, Lange's papers of 1936 and 1937 suggested that three types of data are necessary for economic calculation - individual preferences, prices, and knowledge about available resources. One key difference between Lange and von Mises is their approach to price determination. Lange believed that prices can be established by analyzing individual preferences and information about available resources, while von Mises saw price determination as possible only in a market-based economy that is founded on private property ownership."," Abba Lerner and Oskar Lange recognized the significance of market prices in economic calculation, but they rejected the idea that a free market based on private property was a prerequisite for economic calculation. Instead, they argued that planners could imitate any market outcome, thus rendering private property unnecessary. Lange's support for market socialism was highlighted in his 1936 and 1937 papers, which claimed that three factors - individual preferences, prices, and knowledge about available resources - are essential for economic calculation. A key contrast between Lange and von Mises is the way they approach price determination. Lange believed that prices could be determined by gathering data on individual preferences and resource availability, using a trial-and-error method or a Tatonnement solution to find equilibrium. In contrast, von Mises opined that private property-based market economies were the only systems in which price determination could occur."," Abba Lerner and Oskar Lange recognized the crucial role of market prices in economic calculation, but they disputed the idea that a free market based on private property was a prerequisite for this process. According to their argument, planners could replicate any market outcome, rendering private property unnecessary. In his papers of 1936 and 1937, Lange advocated for market socialism, maintaining that three things - individual preferences, prices, and knowledge about available resources - were fundamental for calculation purposes. The way in which Lange and von Mises differed on this point was most evident in their approaches to price determination. Lange believed that prices could be established by analyzing individual preferences and resource availability, using either a trial-and-error process or a Tatonnement solution to attain equilibrium. In contrast, von Mises believed that price determination was possible only in a market economy that was grounded in private property rights."
" Lavoie's revision of von Mises's socialism critique suggested that market socialism advocates don't nullify the arguments that von Mises proposed. Lange's solution presupposed a Walrasian model of static general equilibrium, which was not the suitable framework that von Mises and Austrians designated for the problem of economic calculation regarding the dynamic adjustment and discovery of the continuously shifting circumstances like technologies and preferences. Although von Mises never denied the calculability of socialism in a static situation, it is irrelevant to real-world situations where economic calculation is impossible due to the socialist economy's collective form of properties. So, the computation argument becomes downplayed, and the problem remains unsolvable, as the equations cannot be set up from the beginning."," Lavoie (1981) sought to revise von Mises's critique of socialism, stating that the advocates of market socialism do not invalidate von Mises's argument. Von Mises and Austrian economists perceived the entire problem of economic calculation on a different framework, emphasizing the dynamic adjustment and discovery that occurs amid the continuously changing circumstances such as preferences and technologies. Lange's solution presupposed the Walrasian model of static general equilibrium, which von Mises considered unsuitable for economic calculation. According to Lavoie, von Mises never denied that economic calculation could work in static settings, but this is not the case in the real world. Economic calculation is not achievable in a collective economy because the equations cannot be formulated from the outset. Hence, the computation argument is downplayed."," In the context of the revised version presented by Lavoie (1981), the critique of socialism by von Mises remains unaffected by the stance of market socialism advocates. Lange's solution was based on the Walrasian model of static general equilibrium, which von Mises deemed inappropriate, as it did not consider the dynamic adjustments and discoveries that occur due to various changing factors like technologies and preferences. According to Lavoie, von Mises acknowledged the possibility of economic calculation in socialist economies in static conditions but realized that such conditions are rare in the real world. In a collective economy, the problem of economic calculation is not primarily due to the sheer volume of equations to be solved but rather to the inability to establish the equations from the beginning. Lavoie's view relegates the computation argument to a less significant position in the debate."
" In the following section, we shall analyze a recent disagreement on the boundaries of computability in an economic system that is dependent on central planning and collective property ownership. The debate revolves around Robert Murphy's adoption of a revised stance in the economic calculation debate. Murphy presented a new argument to reinforce his theory that computational models can't solve the economic problem in principle (Murphy, 2006). However, Cottrell et al. held a standard perspective in the economic calculation debate and opposed Murphy's argument."," In the next section, we will delve into recent deliberations surrounding the limitations of computational power in an economic system grounded in central planning and collective property ownership. Robert Murphy, who took on a revised position during the economic calculation debate, articulated a fresh argument that maintains the principle which suggests that computational models could never solve the economic problem (Murphy, 2006). However, Cottrell et al. (2007a, b) upheld the standard position in the economic calculation debate and challenged Murphy's proposed argument."," The upcoming section will examine a recent debate noting the boundaries of computational capability in an economic system dependent on central planning and collective ownership. Robert Murphy adopted a modified stance in the economic calculation debate and presented a new argument supporting the thesis that it is impossible to solve the economic problem with computational models in principle (Murphy, 2006). In contrast, Cottrell et al. (2007a, b) stuck to the standard position in the debate and refuted Murphy's argument."
" Murphy emphasizes that his argument is not a one-step process. He highlights that entrepreneurs continue to innovate in the market process, leading to an ever-expanding list of goods to be produced. To mimic such a market process, a central planning unit must consider all potential future goods and commodities that may emerge in the market, including intermediate goods. As a result, the central planner must possess a corresponding list of prices for all end products, as well as implicit prices of intermediate goods required for the production of consumer goods."," The argument presented by Murphy is not a straightforward one. He emphasizes that entrepreneurs are continuously innovating in the market process, which leads to an ever-evolving list of goods that need to be produced. Therefore, to replicate this market process, the central planning unit must consider all potential products and commodities that might appear in the future, including intermediate goods. To do this, the central planner must have a corresponding list of prices for all final products as well as implicit prices for the required intermediate goods that are necessary for the production of consumer goods."," Murphy's argument is not a straightforward one as it involves multiple steps.

" Hunter (1996) explains that demonstrating the uncountable infiniteness of prices can be facilitated by referring to Cantor's diagonal argument, which is also used to establish the existence of an uncountable set."," To establish the notion that prices are uncountably infinite, Hunter (1996) recommends an analysis of Cantor's diagonal argument which is commonly utilized to prove the existence of an uncountable set."," Using Cantor's diagonal argument to demonstrate the existence of an uncountable set, Hunter (1996) suggests that this technique can also be employed to explain why prices are infinitely uncountable."
" Cottrell and colleagues (2007a, b) argued against the claim made by R. Murphy regarding the uncountability of market prices and the infiniteness of the set. According to Cottrell et al., commodities are produced from a finite amount of other commodities, and their basic components are composed of a finite number of atoms. Hence, every commodity can be represented by a unique integer identifier based on a Godel number, which takes into account the number of atoms of each element the commodity contains. The researchers concluded that since all possible commodities can be enumerated, the set of commodities must be finite and countable. Therefore, based on their argument, the set of corresponding prices must also be countable."," Cottrell and colleagues (2007a, b) disagreed with the argument put forth by R. Murphy that the set of market prices is infinite and uncountable. They asserted that as every commodity is made up of a finite amount of other commodities, and raw materials consist of a finite number of atoms, the total number of commodities must also be countable. To give every commodity a unique identifier, they suggested representing each commodity through a Godel number that takes into account the number of atoms of each composition element. Cottrell et al. concluded that all potential commodities are enumerable, indicating that the set of commodities must be both countable and finite. Consequently, they argued that, based on this reasoning, the set of corresponding prices must also be countable."," Cottrell and colleagues (2007a,b) disputed R.Murphy's claim that the set of market prices is infinite and uncountable. They argued that since commodities are produced from a finite number of other commodities, and raw materials are built of a finite number of atoms, the count of all commodities should also be finite and countable. To provide commodities with a unique identification number, they proposed using Godel numbers that take into account the number of atoms comprising each composition element to represent every commodity archetype. The researchers concluded that since all possible commodities can be counted, the set of commodities must be finite and countable. In light of this argument, they asserted that the set of correlated prices must also be countable."
" Cottrell et al. (2007a, b, p. 3) brought up an intriguing matter regarding the endless amount of prices that exist in a market economy. They point out that individuals do not need to factor in all possible prices when making economic decisions, as doing so would render the economic calculation problem unsolvable. Therefore, it remains unclear why Murphy is insisting that a central planning unit must consider all possible prices, goods, and services, including those that have not yet been invented."," The issue of infinite uncountable prices in a market economy was raised by Cottrell et al. (2007a, b, p.3). They emphasize that individuals do not need to take into account all possible prices for successful economic decision-making since considering every option would leave the economic calculation problem unsolvable. Hence, the reasoning behind Murphy's insistence that a central planning unit should consider all possible prices, goods, and services, including those that have yet to exist, remains unclear."," Cottrell et al. (2007a, b, p.3) posed a compelling question regarding the notion of infinite uncountable prices in a market economy. They argued that individuals do not need to take every conceivable price into account to make profitable economic decisions. In fact, considering every possible price point would make the economic calculation problem impossible to solve. Therefore, it is unclear why Murphy is pressing for a central planning unit to consider every conceivable price, good, and service, even those that might not exist yet."
" The motivation to take into account all possible prices extends beyond the innovation problem and relates to the nature of private property within a market economy. In a market economy, individuals express their preferences through their possessions and the exchanges they make. However, their exchanges are limited since they can only exchange what they have, resulting in a finite set of preferences. In contrast, in a society with collective forms of property, the individuals can express an unlimited number of preferences, which the central planning unit must take into account. If the planner attempts to mimic market processes, they must consider all the infinite preferences of individuals, resulting in an infinite set of prices that aligns with the subjective value theory."," The requirement to take all possible prices into account stems not only from the innovation problem but also from the concept of private property in a market economy. In such a system, individuals express their preferences through market exchanges but are limited by the finite amount of possessions they have to exchange. On the other hand, in a society based on collective forms of property, individuals' preferences are nearly infinite, and the central planning unit must consider them all. To mimic market processes, the planner must account for all virtually infinite individual preferences, resulting in an infinite set of prices that wholeheartedly correlates with the subjective value theory."," Murphy argues that the necessity to consider all feasible prices is not only driven by the innovation problem, but is also a result of private property in a market economy. In a market economy, individuals express their preferences through their assets and the exchanges they make. However, since they possess only a finite amount of things to exchange, they cannot undertake an infinite number of exchanges. This renders the set of preferences of individuals on the market as a finite set. In contrast, in a society that has collective property forms, the individuals' preferences are not restricted. They can express as many preferences as they want, which the central planning unit must consider. To mimic market processes, the planner must take into account all the virtually infinite preferences of individuals, resulting in an infinite set of prices that aligns with the theory of subjective value."
 There is a single lingering issue that demands clarity: we failed to provide a direct response to the first question posed. Is the list of prices actually infinite and uncountable? Our answer mainly focused on highlighting the fact that the potential collection of individual preferences has no bounds. This is a result of the absence of any constraints on individuals when it comes to expressing their preferences.," There is one outstanding matter that requires further attention: we have yet to address the initial question in a straightforward manner. Is the list of prices genuinely an uncountable, infinite list? However, we did emphasize the fact that the pool of conceivable individual preferences is immeasurable since there are no restrictions on individuals expressing their preferences."," The first question remains unanswered - is the list of prices truly infinite and uncountable? Instead, we mainly highlighted the fact that individual preferences have no limit, making the potential range of preference sets infinite. Since individuals can express their preferences fully without any constraints, there is no way to restrict the pool of conceivable preferences."
" The use of Cantor's diagonal argument demonstrates that the set of prices the planner needs to consider is not only infinite but also uncountable. To begin with, each good and its price are defined using equations and sets or subsets of preferences. It is also assumed that there is an infinite set of potential preferences of individuals (p1, p2...pn). By employing the technique of changing each ""Yes"" to ""No"" and each ""No"" to ""Yes"" diagonally, it is possible to define a new subset of preferences that have never been listed before. Therefore, although there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all potential preferences and the natural numbers, there is no such correspondence between the set of all subsets of preferences and the natural numbers. As a result, the number of subsets of preferences for defining prices of goods is an uncountable, infinite set (Table III)."," Cantor's diagonal argument can establish that the set of prices that the planner needs to consider is not simply infinite but also uncountable. The initial step is to define each good and price using equations and sets or subsets of preferences. Secondly, it is assumed that the possible preferences of individuals form an infinite set (p1, p2...pn). Following these premises, a subset of preferences that is distinct from all other pre-existing and future subsets can be established. By changing ""Yes"" to ""No"" and ""No"" to ""Yes"" diagonally, a new subset of preferences never listed before can be produced. Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all possible preferences and natural numbers, but there is no such correspondence between the set of all subsets of preferences and natural numbers. As a result, the number of subsets of preferences used to determine the prices of goods is an uncountable, infinite set (Table III)."," The application of Cantor's diagonal argument allows for the proof that the set of prices the planner must account for is not only infinite but also uncountable.

" The problem of the infinite uncountable set of preferences cannot be solely resolved by the consumer goods market, even if the consumer preferences are limited in number. This difficulty persists because the preferences of managers and entrepreneurs belong to an infinite uncountable set. In some instances, the products provided by managers and entrepreneurs don't meet the specific requests of consumers. For instance, the making of the movie named The Matrix by the Wachowski brothers was not triggered by customer demands. Additionally, the investment preferences of entrepreneurs are always limited by the available capital they possess. Furthermore, if there's a central planning unit involved in a planned economy, it still encounters difficulties when determining the prices of intermediate products. This is a result of the central unit having to consider an infinite uncountable set of prices for intermediate products while making their decisions."," Even if we assume that the consumer preferences are finite, the market for consumer goods alone is not equipped to tackle the problem of the infinite uncountable set of preferences. This is because the preferences of entrepreneurs and managers exist within an infinite uncountable set. On the market, entrepreneurs and managers may provide products that aren't specifically in demand by consumers. As an illustration, the creation of the movie, The Matrix, by the Wachowski brothers wasn't a result of a particular consumer request. Similarly, the investment preferences of entrepreneurs are restricted by their available capital. In a centrally planned economy, the central planning unit would still have to face the challenge of defining prices for intermediate goods by considering an infinite uncountable set of prices."," The issue of the infinite uncountable set of preferences cannot be solved by the consumer goods market alone, even if we consider the set of consumer preferences to be finite. Entrepreneurs and managers have preferences that are still part of an infinite uncountable set. Quite often on the market, entrepreneurs and managers provide products that cater to the needs and desires of consumers that they have not explicitly expressed. For example, the Wachowski brothers created the movie, The Matrix, without any specific demand from the consumers. Investment preferences of entrepreneurs are limited by the amount of capital they own, and in a planned economy, a central planning unit still has to determine a price for intermediate goods, which is not an easy task due to an infinite uncountable set of prices."
" In the discussion regarding economic calculation, Lange contended that the central planner must depend on market prices for consumer goods to deduce the prices of intermediate goods. However, von Mises argued that this approach would not work because the planner would face the same difficulties at the intermediate goods level. According to von Mises, intermediate good prices are not established by technical means as the production factors are neither entirely specific nor entirely non-specific. Several approaches can be used to create final products using intermediate goods. Although the prices of intermediate goods may rely on individual preferences for final products, entrepreneurs set prices by bidding different quantities of intermediate goods. Entrepreneurs use market prices for intermediate goods to locate the most profitable solution. For this reason, the central planner will face comparable problems at the intermediate goods level that they previously encountered with consumer goods."," In the classical debate on economic calculation, Lange proposed that the central planner should rely on market prices for consumer goods to calculate the prices of intermediate goods. However, von Mises rebuked this idea, arguing that it would not solve the issue since the planner would confront the same obstacle at the intermediate goods level. According to von Mises (1990), the prices of intermediate goods were not determined through technical methods since production factors were neither entirely specific nor entirely nonspecific. There are several potential ways to produce final goods utilizing intermediate goods. While the prices of intermediate goods might be partially based on consumers' preferences for final goods, entrepreneurs ultimately establish these prices by bidding for different amounts of intermediate goods. The use of market prices helps entrepreneurs choose the most profitable options. As a result, the central planner will encounter similar problems when handling intermediate goods, as they formerly did when dealing with consumer goods."," The classical economic calculation debate involved Lange's proposal that the central planner must rely on market prices for consumer goods to determine the prices of intermediate goods.

Entrepreneurs use market prices for intermediate goods to identify the most profitable strategy. As a result, the central planner will confront a similar set of difficulties at the intermediate goods level as they confronted with consumer goods."
" We have revised and reformulated Murphy's arguments to ensure accuracy, drawing on Cantor's theorem from set theories. As a result, we argue that a computational model in a planned economy must account for an uncountably infinite set of equations and prices. This leads us to the conclusion that the central planner's biggest challenge is not computing the large number of equations involved, but rather the impossibility of initially setting up all the necessary calculus equations. Consequently, we maintain that computational models are unable to simulate the market process."," Our paper refines and reformulates Murphy's arguments by incorporating Cantor's theorem from set theories. Our thesis is that a computational model in a planned economy must consider an uncountably infinite set of equations and prices.

Consequently, we maintain that computational models cannot replicate the complexities of the market process."
" The fundamental aspect of the economic calculation debate is the understanding of how prices are formed, which is influenced by the different theories of value.

"This study investigates the significance of economic expectations on various political attitudes in the backdrop of the global economic crisis that occurred between 2008 and 2009. The research emphasizes the critical role of information on evaluations during severe economic downturns. Unlike prior studies conducted during stable economic times, this research accounts for the impact of media exposure and content on changes in economic evaluations. Accurate news exposure exhibited a substantial influence on the anticipated development of the national economy, while individual economic expectations appeared to be largely independent of media exposure. This research further highlights the fact that the strength of the media influence increases with increased media dependency.

" This paragraph discusses the significance of examining citizens' economic expectations during unstable economic periods, which has received minimal attention in existing literature focused on established democracies. The study delves into economic perceptions during times of rapid decline, contrasting with the previous research centered on stable economic developments. In times of economic crisis, individuals are susceptible to uncertainty about their economic prospects, which they often deal with by seeking information. Mass media becomes crucial in these scenarios as heightened media coverage during challenging economic times emphasizes the importance of accurate and timely economic information."," The core theme of this paragraph revolves around exploring citizens' economic expectations in established democracies, specifically during periods of economic stability examined by existing literature. The present study takes a different approach by examining economic perceptions during times of rapidly deteriorating economic prospects, a topic largely overlooked in prior research. During economic crises, people tend to experience uncertainty regarding their economic situation, leading them to seek relevant information. Due to the intensified media coverage during adverse economic times, the role of mass-mediated economic information becomes even more significant than usual."," The central argument of this paragraph revolves around scrutinizing citizens' economic expectations in established democracies, particularly during periods of relative economic stability analyzed in current literature. Conversely, this study proposes investigating economic perceptions during times of rapid economic decline, which has received little attention in previous research. During economic crises, individuals often experience uncertainty about their economic future, leading to information-seeking behavior to mitigate this uncertainty. Furthermore, the increased coverage of economic adversity by the media during these times may magnify the importance of accurate and easily accessible economic information."
" Citizens are not always expected to have complete information regarding economic matters according to Rational choice theorists, and they are ""rationally ignorant"" about current events in general (Downs, 1957). However, empirical research indicates that citizens, particularly during election periods, have substantial insight into economic topics such as their country's unemployment rate (Paldam and Nannestad, 2000). Nevertheless, there are several reasons why citizens' beliefs may differ from the actual state of affairs (Hetherington, 1996). Kinder et al (1989) suggest that each citizen uses different standards when assessing how the economy is doing. Furthermore, citizens' partisanship may have a biasing effect, with citizens likelier to view the economy more favorably when their party is in power (Kramer, 1983; Wlezien et al, 1997; Van der Eijk et al, 2007). Lastly, in this study, the focus is the role of the mass media as a significant information source for citizens when forming their judgments regarding the economy."," Rational choice theorists contend that it is not rational for citizens to consistently possess complete knowledge about the nation's economic status, and similar to general affairs, they are ""rationally ignorant"" (Downs, 1957). Despite this, some citizens do have a considerable understanding of economic issues, specifically during election periods, such as unemployment rates (Paldam and Nannestad, 2000). However, various factors can cause citizens' perceptions to differ from the reality of economic conditions, including different evaluation standards among citizens (Kinder et al, 1989), partisanship (Kramer, 1983), and whether their preferred party is in power (Wlezien et al, 1997; Van der Eijk et al, 2007). The present study focuses on the role of the mass media as a crucial information source for citizens when forming their assessments about the economy."," According to Rational choice theorists, citizens are not expected to have complete knowledge about the state of the economy permanently.

" Studies on the political effects of the economy often revolve around the subjective economy, which reflects the evaluations and perceptions of citizens towards the economy. Early research interest focused on the role of mass media in shaping economic voting behavior rather than objective markers, which proved successful in explaining voting behavior and election outcomes. This raised concerns about a possible disconnect between the perceived and actual state of the economy. Studies that investigated this phenomenon in contexts like the 1992 US Presidential election, 2001 UK General election, and 1998 German Bundestag election revealed that perceived economic situations played an essential role in electoral outcomes. Hetherington's finding that negative mass-media coverage didn't stop Clinton's victory in the US 1992 Presidential election illustrated this point."," In studies examining the political impact of the economy, researchers often place emphasis on the subjective economy - the way in which individuals perceive and make judgments about the economy. Previous research in this area has explored the mediating role of mass media in shaping economic voting behaviour. This research has highlighted that subjective evaluations of the economy are often more effective than objective measures in explanation voting behaviours and election outcomes. As a result, there may be a disconnect between individuals' perceptions of the economy and the actual state of the economy. Examples such as the 1992 US Presidential election, the 2001 UK General election, and the 1998 German Bundestag election demonstrate this. For instance, negative mass media coverage failed to prevent Clinton's victory in 1992. Instead, a positive perception of the economy played a more significant role in the election outcome."," The subjective economy - citizens' evaluations and perceptions of the economy - constitutes a crucial element of research on the political impact of the economy. Early studies on the role of the mass media in the economic voting model identified a distortion between the subjective and the real economy. Researchers found that subjective assessments of the economy were more effective in explaining voting behaviour and election outcomes than objective measures. This observation led some to question the impact of media coverage on political decision-making. For example, research by Hetherington found that despite negative reports on the economy in the mass media, the US economy had recovered before the 1992 presidential election. This suggests that Clinton's success was built not on the actual state of the economy but on the public's perception of it. Other studies, such as the 2001 UK General election and 1998 German Bundestag election, also showed the importance of the subjective economy in shaping political outcomes."
" The impact of media on economic assessments has been primarily studied at a macro-level. Mosley's (1984) investigation revealed that media estimates of the economic situation were a significantly better predictor of economic assessments than official economic indicators. Sanders et al. (1993) and Goidel and Langley (1995) also discovered that the tone of economic news coverage affects public assessments in the United Kingdom and the United States, respectively. However, only negative news coverage has a significant influence on public evaluations, according to Soroka's (2006) more recent analysis, which is consistent with Ju's (2008) findings.

" It is argued that media effects are more likely to occur for assessments of the national economy than for evaluations of personal economic situations. While citizens are likely to notice economic changes that affect them personally, broader economic changes are less likely to be noticed. Media and social interactions become important for citizens to learn about these national economic changes. Mutz (1992) found that media coverage is a significant factor in identifying unemployment as a social problem, while personal experience with unemployment contributes to the perception of it as a personal problem."," The authors suggest that media effects are mainly observed in assessments of the national economy rather than evaluations of personal economic situations. Although citizens might observe the economic changes in their immediate surroundings, it is difficult for them to notice national economic developments firsthand. Therefore, media and social interactions play a vital role in providing citizens with updates and information about national economic changes. Mutz (1992) found that media coverage influences perceptions of unemployment as a social problem, while personal experience with unemployment contributes to its perception as a personal problem."," According to the authors, media effects are more likely to be observed in evaluations of the national economy than those of personal economic situations.

" It has been demonstrated that there is a difference in people's response to positive and negative economic news coverage. Negative information tends to receive more attention and is more frequently used when formulating opinions. Political communication research validates that negative news, including threat or risk frames, creates more powerful impacts on public opinion when compared to positive news. These findings are similar to those from classic persuasion studies that indicate a prevalence of threats and negativity. Recent media and economic studies argue that negative economic news is more likely to be picked up by the public, thus we expect the strength of negative economic news to have a greater effect than that of positive news."," Examining the impact of positive versus negative economic news coverage is important, as research has shown differences in how people respond to each type. Individuals tend to pay more attention to negative information and use it more frequently when forming opinions. Studies in the area of political communication reveal that negative news, particularly that which utilizes threat or risk frames, has a more significant effect on public opinion compared to positive news. This aligns with the results of classic persuasion studies that show a prevalence of negativity and threats. Recent research in media and the economy suggests that people are more inclined to consume negative information about the economy. Therefore, it is anticipated that the impact of negative economic news will outweigh that of positive developments."," It is crucial to analyze the potential disparities in how positive versus negative economic news coverage affects individuals. Psychological research consistently shows that negative information garners more attention and is more frequently used when shaping opinions. Political communication research supports these findings, indicating that negative information, especially when presented in a threat or risk framing, has a more profound influence on public opinion dynamics compared to positive news. This is further reinforced by earlier investigations on classic persuasion studies that emphasize the prevalence of negativity and threat. Recent studies in media and the economy show that negative economic news tends to get more attention from people. As a result, it can be expected that negative economic news will carry more weight than positive news."
" While there has been a longstanding assumption that mass media content has the same influence on everyone, this notion is considered naive according to some scholars (such as Delli Carpini in 2004). More recent research into political communication has emphasized that the effects of media are not universal, but rather dependent upon the individual. In our study on media effects concerning economic assessments, we explore this perspective further. It is important to understand the extent to which people depend on the media to interpret their environment, as this has a significant impact on their opinions and evaluations. Media system dependency theory (MD) posits that an individual's reliance on news media can determine how much they are affected by media messages. This theory has been supported by empirical research on health communication effects, as seen in findings by Morton and Duck (2001)."," It was once assumed that mass media content has the same impact on all individuals. However, recent research into political communication has shown that this proposition might be over-simplified. Scholars, including Delli Carpini in 2004, have highlighted the contingency of media effects, which is something we consider in our study on media effects on economic assessments. We acknowledge that the media can have varying effects on different people, depending on the extent to which they rely on it for interpreting their surroundings. This connection between media dependency and media effects is central to Media system dependency theory (MD), which describes how the impact of news coverage on the public is shaped by the degree to which people depend on it for information. Self-reported dependency on mass-mediated information has been seen to impact the impact of mass communication on personal and impersonal perceptions (as noted by Morton and Duck in 2001), thus giving support to the MD theory."," The idea that mass media affects all individuals equally has been challenged in the field of political communication, as some scholars consider it to be naive (e.g., Delli Carpini in 2004). In our study on media effects on economic assessments, we adopt this perspective and analyze how media dependency can influence individual opinions and evaluations. It is crucial to understand the extent to which people rely on the media to interpret their surroundings, as it helps to explain the influence of media messages on public perceptions. Media system dependency theory (MD) posits that individuals who are more dependent on news media are more likely to be impacted by media coverage. This theory has received support from empirical research on the effects of health communication (Morton and Duck in 2001). Therefore, the impact of media messages on individuals is not universal, but rather contingent upon media dependency."

" We utilized three-wave panel survey data and analyzed news content between the panel waves to investigate the expectations that we formulated earlier.

" As a result of practical constraints, we relied on a more limited group of media outlets for the second period. Nevertheless, the descriptive results suggest a significant similarity among outlets for that period. For instance, two out of the three most negative outlets from the first period remain the most negative in the second period (Metro period 1: 2, NRC Handelsblad period 1: 1.78, Metro period 2: 2, NRC Handelsblad period 2: 1.69). Additionally, in the first period, nine out of eleven outlets had national economic evaluations within the range of -1 to -2, which is true for seven out of eight outlets analyzed for the second period. Similarly, when we repeated the analyses for the first period and only considered those outlets available in the second period, the results were almost identical. This gives us confidence that our more limited selection of outlets for the second period is adequate."," Due to practical limitations, we had to restrict the number of media outlets used for the second period. Nonetheless, we observed considerable similarity among the outlets during that time frame according to the descriptive results.

Furthermore, in the first period, nine out of eleven outlets had national economic evaluations ranging between -1 and -2, which was consistent with seven out of the eight outlets analyzed in the second period. Additionally, replicating the analyses for the first period while only considering outlets available in the second period resulted in highly comparable findings. This gives us confidence that our narrower selection of outlets for the second period was sufficient."," Practical limitations led us to utilize a more limited number of media outlets for the second phase. Nonetheless, the descriptive results showed a significant homogeneity among outlets during that time period.

" To test the hypotheses, data is collected from a three-wave panel survey of Dutch citizens who are eligible to vote. A total of 2,400 random individuals aged over 17 are selected from a pool of 143,809 citizens in an online panel and they are requested to fill out an online questionnaire. Out of the chosen individuals, only 1394 respondents completed the questionnaire which implies a 58% response rate (RR1).

" We utilize multiple OLS regression analyses to evaluate the hypotheses, presenting four models for sociotropic expectations and four models for egocentric expectations. These models examine the relationship between economic expectations at t2 and t3 and the aforementioned variables, while controlling for economic expectations at t1 or t2. The use of a lagged variable allows us to focus on changes in the dependent variable between waves, and incorporating previous economic assessments as controls ensures that our models are not lacking any predictors of static economic evaluations. This methodology is similar to that of Markus (1979)."," To evaluate the hypotheses, we conduct several OLS regression analyses. We provide four models each for sociotropic and egocentric expectations. These models examine the relationship between economic expectations at t2 and t3 and the variables mentioned earlier, while controlling for economic expectations at t1 or t2. The incorporation of a lagged variable centers the attention on the change in the dependent variable between two panel waves, which is similar to Markus (1979). Additionally, the previous economic assessments are included as controls to minimize the probability of our models being underspecified by incorporating predictors of static economic evaluations with the lagged term."," In order to evaluate the hypothesizes, we carry out multiple OLS regression analyses.

Using a lagged variable focuses on changes in the dependent variable between two waves as suggested by Markus (1979). Furthermore, including prior economic assessments as controls diminishes the probability of our models being insufficiently specified by accounting for predictors of static economic evaluations with the lagged term."
" The study results reveal an interesting finding that changes in sociotropic expectations are not influenced by personal economic circumstances, while changes in egocentric expectations are somewhat related to household income. Since household income can be used as a representative measure for information on personal financial status, this finding suggests that citizens utilize different sources of information (personal experience compared to mass media) to develop various economic expectations."," The findings of the study are quite fascinating as they show that personal economic circumstances have no impact on changes in sociotropic expectations, but there is a certain degree of correlation between household income and changes in egocentric expectations. Household income can act as an approximate indicator of an individual's personal economic situation. Therefore, these outcomes provide suggestive proof that people rely on diverse information sources - such as personal experience versus mass media - to shape different types of economic expectations."," An intriguing observation from the study is that while changes in sociotropic expectations were not impacted by personal economic circumstances, changes in egocentric expectations were somewhat connected to household income. Household income served as a proxy measure for individuals' personal economic situation. Thus, the findings suggest that citizens utilize different sources of information (personal experience versus mass media) when forming various economic expectations."
" During our study, we found that there was no significant change in people's egocentric expectations at the aggregate level, even amidst the worst crisis in half a century. A majority of people believed that their own financial situation would not be jeopardized, despite predicting that the national economy could collapse within the next year. This trend was not unique to the Dutch case and has been observed all over Europe. The reasons behind this pattern could be explained by a lack of experience with severe economic crises, a psychological phenomenon of people's disbelief that misfortune could happen to them, or the fact that it takes time for national economic developments to affect individuals. According to economists, it takes time for the crisis to translate into individual pocketbook considerations. Citizens in general do not seem to link macroeconomic figures to their personal situation."," Despite the worst crisis faced in half a century, the egocentric outlook on the aggregate level of people did not witness any significant change during the study. The majority of people still held on to the belief that their personal financial situation would not be affected, even with the knowledge that the national economy could crumble within the year. This trend wasn't exclusive to the Dutch case, but rather apparent throughout Europe. The reasons behind this trend could be due to a lack of experience with severe economic crises, a general psychological phenomenon of people not believing that misfortune could befall them or time taken for national economic developments to translate into individual pocket book considerations, as acknowledged by experts. On the whole, it is clear that citizens do not link macroeconomic figures to their personal economic situation."," While our study was in progress, egocentric expectations remained largely unchanged at the aggregate level. Remarkably, people were not affected by the worst crisis of half a century regarding their outlook on their personal financial situations. Irrespective of their predictions on the national economy's performance, most individuals felt that their finances would not be jeopardized. The pattern was not exclusive to the Dutch population, but rather a phenomenon seen all over Europe, according to the Eurobarometer 71. The reasons behind this trend could be the lack of experience with severe economic crises, a general psychological phenomenon of people at large denying the possibility of failures happening to them, or the crisis requiring more time to affect masses. Economists suggest that it takes a while for national economic considerations to translate individual pocketbook considerations. All in all, citizens do not credit macroeconomic figures with their personal situation."
" Prior research suggests a negativity bias in media effects on economic perceptions, but our findings contradict this notion. Our study period had prominently negative news coverage, and thus weighting negative news did not impact the independent variable significantly. Moreover, previous studies only observed negativity bias in macro-level time-series studies, and the differences in micro-level dynamics during times of crisis may play a role. Lastly, our research cannot compare the outcomes in times of prosperity with highly positive economic news. Therefore, it is vital to conduct more studies to understand how media effects differ in economic growth compared to crisis."," The results of our study contradict previous research that established a negativity bias in media effects on economic perceptions. The reason for this discrepancy could be that the news coverage during our research period was almost exclusively negative, leading to little variation in the independent variable with an increase in negative news. Also, past research established negativity bias only through macro-level time-series studies, leading to differences in micro-level dynamics during times of economic crises. Additionally, our research cannot compare the outcomes in positive economic news conditions, and future studies should aim to investigate the differences in media effects between times of crisis and prosperity."," While prior studies have uncovered a negativity bias in media effects on economic perceptions, our research data fails to support such a bias. We speculate that the one-sided negative news coverage during our research period might have limited the impact of an increase in negative news on the independent variable. Additionally, the previously established negativity bias has only been reported in macro-level time-series studies, and the current research on an individual level during times of economic crisis with a highly negative news environment could be very different. Finally, we cannot compare our findings with those of a booming economy that features overall positive economic news coverage, and future studies should examine how media effects differ during times of prosperity compared to a recession."
" The current study builds upon previous research by taking into consideration the contextual nature of news effects. Our findings support the notion that media dependency acts as a vital moderator of media influence. We discovered that people who heavily rely on the news tend to react more strongly to positive versus negative economic information, which affirms our third hypothesis (H3). These findings align with Ball-Rokeach et al's (1984) research, which demonstrated that media effects were more pronounced among individuals with higher levels of dependency. Future research could focus on exploring other factors outside of our current model to better understand the motivations and dependency levels of individuals for information from the media. Additionally, our results indicate that media dependency was more important in shaping expectations in the second period, while outlet-specific exposure was more relevant in the first period."," This study builds upon prior research by incorporating an understanding of the contingent nature of news effects. Our results lend credence to the argument that media dependency serves as a critical moderator of media influence. Our findings indicate that individuals who have a greater reliance on the news tend to have a stronger response to positive versus negative economic information, thereby supporting our third hypothesis (H3). This outcome is in keeping with previous research by Ball-Rokeach et al (1984), which found that individuals with higher levels of dependency had a more significant impact on the attitudes and behaviors affected by the media. Future research should look beyond our current model to explore factors external to it to chart the antecedents of motivations and media dependency for information. Furthermore, our findings show that media dependency directly impacted expectations in the second period, while outlet-specific exposure was less crucial for those with a greater reliance on the media."," This research advances previous studies by considering the conditionality of news effects. Our findings support the argument that media dependency is a crucial moderator of media influence. In particular, our results demonstrate that the impact of exposure to positive versus negative economic information on economic expectations in the news becomes more pronounced for individuals with greater media dependency (which supports H3). These outcomes align with the research of Ball-Rokeach et al (1984), who discovered that individuals with higher levels of dependency had the strongest media effects on attitudes and behaviors. To better understand the antecedents of motivations and media dependency for information, future research should focus on external factors beyond our current model. Based on our results, we found that media dependency had a direct effect on changing expectations in the second period, whereas outlet-specific exposure was less important for individuals who heavily rely on the media."
" Despite the limitations, our research findings have contributed significantly towards a better understanding of economic evaluations and their relation with news coverage. It is essential to acknowledge that media coverage of the economy can impact political outcomes. When a positive economic outlook results in higher chances of a political party getting votes, then the opposite is also true. Thus, negative media representation of economic prospects can be dangerous for people in power. Furthermore, this negativity could have a trickle-down effect on the economy, where negative perceptions of future conditions can lead to reduced consumption and thus, impact the broader economic situation. Even if our study's focus was on a unique economic crisis, these dynamics are relevant beyond it."," Despite its limitations, our study has advanced our understanding of economic evaluations and their relationship with media coverage. We recognize that media portrayal of the economy can have ramifications for politics. For instance, if a media outlet depicts a positive economic outlook, this can increase the chances of a political party winning votes, and the same can occur in reverse. Therefore, a negative portrayal of economic prospects in the media can be detrimental to those in power. In addition, there is a possibility that this negativity might cause a spiral effect on economic conditions, leading to reduced consumption amongst people who have a bleak view of the future. While our research focused on a specific economic context, these insights have implications beyond the crisis we studied."," Despite the limitations of the study, our research findings have contributed to our understanding of how economic evaluations relate to media coverage. We acknowledge that media representation of the economy can influence political outcomes. When a positive economic outlook is portrayed, it can lead to a higher likelihood of voting for a particular party, and the inverse is true as well. Therefore, negative media portrayal of economic prospects can be precarious for those in power. Additionally, a downward spiral effect on economic conditions is conceivable if people who are more pessimistic about the future's economic situation are less likely to consume, thereby impacting economic conditions. While our study was conducted during a specific economic crisis, these findings have relevance beyond it."

" A knowledge economy is an economy that relies on knowledge to produce goods and services, and economic models play a crucial role in understanding how such an economy should work. In particular, an effective financial system is necessary for the knowledge economy to operate smoothly. The complexity of societies cannot be understood by any single social science discipline, making cross-disciplinary approaches to understanding societal models necessary. The failure of mainstream economic theory during the first decade of the 21st century signaled a need for a new, valid theory in the face of scholastic conflict between the different schools of economics. Moving forward, incorporating modeling techniques from both exogenous and endogenous economic schools can help improve our understanding of different parts of the economic system."," The concept of a knowledge economy involves using knowledge to produce goods and services, which is why economic models are important in understanding its operation. In a knowledge economy, a stable financial system is particularly crucial since any failures in finance can derail progress. Given society's complexity, it is necessary to use cross-disciplinary approaches to analyze models of knowledge economies. During the early 2000s, mainstream economic theory failed, and this should have prompted a reconsideration of economic theory. However, the various schools of economics did not work together but instead continued to argue. To improve economic theory, exogenous and endogenous modeling techniques from conflicting economic schools can be used to model different aspects of the economic system."," A knowledge economy is one that produces goods and services using knowledge as the primary resource, making economic models essential for understanding its function. The financial system plays a crucial role in a knowledge economy, and any failure in this aspect can halt progress altogether. Due to the complexity of society, cross-disciplinary approaches are necessary to create models of knowledge economies. During the first decade of the 21st century, mainstream economic theory failed as a basis for financial regulation, but rather than collaborate, the different schools of economics continued to squabble. To reexamine economic theory in a comprehensive way, exogenous and endogenous modeling techniques from conflicting economic schools can be used to model different parts of the economy."
" There was evidence of theory failure in the years following the financial crisis of 2008, and economists were struggling to come to a consensus on how to create valid theories. When scientific theory fails to explain empirical reality, it is generally altered, but this was not the case in the field of economics. Instead of adapting economic theory immediately, economists continued to debate whether the market was empirically perfect or only ideally perfect. Mainstream economic theory was based on the assumption of a perfect market, but it was apparent that the financial market was far from perfect. In 2012, Jean-Claude Trichet, the former president of the European Central Bank, complained that conventional tools were of limited help during the crisis, further highlighting the need for change within the field."," Following the financial crisis of 2008, there was historical evidence of the failure of economic theory and the continuing failure of economists to agree on how to create valid theory.

" Davies had previously held several prestigious positions in academia and the banking industry. Before becoming the Director of the London School of Economics, he served as the Chairman of Britain¡¯s Financial Services Authority and as the Deputy Director of the Bank of England. As an economist with expertise in banking, Davies had a negative opinion about how contemporary economic theory was applied to practical situations. He noted that previous models had erroneously assumed that financial markets could regulate themselves, and financial institutions and their boards were best suited to manage risks. However, the financial crisis exposed the flaws in this assumption, resulting in a shift towards more invasive regulation.

" In 2010, Chris Giles reported that top academic economists from around the world acknowledged that their subject had fatal flaws that were exposed by the financial and economic crisis. The economists, including five Nobel prize-winners, gathered at the Institute for New Economic Thinking's inaugural conference, sponsored by billionaire financier George Soros, at King's College, Cambridge. Although the conference was intended to agree on policies and ideas to prevent another crisis, the participants could not agree on the root cause of the crisis, nor could they suggest remedies to prevent another. The disagreement centered on whether asset price bubbles were the heart of the crisis, with some calling for tighter regulation, while others believed that price swings were simply part of capitalism.

Economists believed they solved their internal disputes and the ""central problem of depression-prevention""; however, everything started to come apart in 2008. The current crisis, which few economists saw coming, exposed the profession's blindness to the possibility of catastrophic failures in a market economy.

Ben Bernanke celebrated the Great Moderation in economic performance over the previous two decades, which he credited to improved economic policy-making in 2004."
" The division among macroeconomists on this matter still persists. There are those who assert that free-market economies never go astray, while others believe that economies can occasionally falter, but that the Federal Reserve can correct any major deviations from the path of prosperity. Neither side was prepared to deal with an economy that went off the rails, despite the Fed's best efforts. Following the financial crisis, Krugman notes that the fault lines within the economics profession have widened even further."," The views of macroeconomists remain divided over this issue.

" Krugman argued that the persistence of the fault line was due to the economics profession's preoccupation with aesthetics. In Krugman's view, economists erroneously considered captivating and mathematically sophisticated theories as synonymous with truth. Prior to the Great Depression, most economists believed that capitalism was a perfect or nearly perfect system, which was not sustainable in the face of massive unemployment. As recollections of the Great Depression faded, economists once again embraced this glorified version of the economy, even using ornate equations to support it. Unfortunately, this false belief in the economy's remarkable operation caused economists to overlook the flaws of human rationality, institutional corruption, and financial market defects that led to unpredictable crashes. Economists also paid no attention to the weighty consequences of a lack of regulation by regulators. (Krugman 2009)."," According to Krugman, the economics profession's obsession with aesthetics can explain the persistence of the fault line. Krugman believed that economists mistakenly perceived beautiful mathematical models as a representation of the truth. Prior to the Great Depression, most economists held onto the notion that capitalism was an ideal system, but mass unemployment exposed the flaws in this line of thinking. However, as memories of the Depression faded, economists once again worshiped the idealized view of the economy, this time supporting it through fancy equations. Sadly, this skewed and mythical view of the economy led economists to ignore numerous threats, such as the limitations of human rationality, institutional failures, market imperfections, and inadequate regulation by regulators, all of which had the potential to cause sudden and unpredictable crashes of the economy's operating system. (Krugman 2009)."," Krugman attributed the persistence of the fault line in the economics profession to their preoccupation with aesthetics. Economists made the mistake of considering mathematically impressive models as representative of the truth, and before the Great Depression, most of them believed that capitalism was a nearly perfect system. However, the massive unemployment that followed the Great Depression showed the flaws in this thinking. As time passed and memories of the Depression faded, economists once again fell in love with the idealized vision of the economy, and this time, they supported it with fancy equations. This romanticized view of the economy caused economists to overlook the potential risks posed by human irrationality, institutional corruption, market imperfections, and inadequate regulation by regulators. As a result, sudden and unpredictable crashes of the economy were a possibility. (Krugman 2009)."
" In an economy, there is a direct correlation between the supply and price of a product (dotted line). As the supply increases, competition among businesses results in a decrease in price. Similarly, if there is an increase in demand for a product (solid line), the price of the product also rises due to the limited availability of the product. The equilibrium price, where supply meets demand, is the optimal price for a product in a market, and no price control is necessary in such a scenario since the market sets the optimal balance between supply and demand."," When the supply of a commodity is plotted against its price in an economy, an inverse relationship is observed (dotted line). This is because increased competition due to a surge in supply forces prices down. Conversely, if there is a spike in demand for a product (solid line), the price also rises due to the fixed supply of the product. The equilibrium price, where supply equals demand, represents the optimal pricing for a product in a market, whereby the market sets the optimal price without the need for pricing controls."," In an economy, the relationship between the supply of a commodity and its price is inverse (dotted line). As more goods enter the market, competition among businesses drives prices down. On the other hand, if demand for a product (solid line) increases, the price is driven up, as the product's quantity is limited. An optimal price for a product (commodity) exists when supply equals demand, which results in an equilibrium price, and this is the perfect scenario, where no pricing control is necessary as the market determines the optimal price."
" The Neo-Keynesians believed that the scope of an economy was limitedly seen as a production system by the Neo-Classical Synthesis School economists. Ben Bernanke argued that economists did not fully recognize the importance of a fit financial system for economic growth, nor did they see the role of financial circumstances in short-term economic dynamics. During the first few decades after World War II, economists prioritized developing broad models of the economy with complete markets, ignoring market ""frictions"" such as transaction costs or imperfect information. Nonetheless, in the absence of such frictions, financial markets have no reason to exist."," According to Neo-Keynesians, the Neo-Classical Synthesis School economists had a narrow view of the economy, regarding it solely as a production system. Ben Bernanke pointed out that economists had failed to grasp the significance of a sound financial system for economic growth or comprehend the influence of financial conditions on short-term economic dynamics. Early post-World War II economic theorists concentrated on creating broad equilibrium models of the economy with complete markets, neglecting market ""frictions"" such as transaction costs or imperfect information. However, financial markets have little impetus to exist in the absence of such frictions."," The Neo-Keynesians argued that the Neo-Classical Synthesis School economists had a limited perception of an economy, restricting it to a production system only.

In the early decades after World War II, economic theorists gave more weight to developing extensive general equilibrium models of the economy with complete markets, overlooking market ""frictions"" like transaction costs or imperfect information. Nevertheless, in the absence of such frictions, financial markets have little justification for their existence."
" Incorporating a time dimension in an economic model is crucial according to Minsky. Keynes had already introduced the concept of time in economics in 1936, which included finance as a part of the economic model. Keynes aimed to develop an economic model where money's neutrality to pricing is challenged by creating a model where the financial asset's price level is determined by financial markets. Money's price as an asset is derived from its liquidity, and each capital and financial asset generates an income stream that has some degree of liquidity and carrying costs. The price level of assets is governed by the relative value of income and liquidity, according to Keynes. (Minsky 1993)"," Minsky believed that including a time dimension in an economic model was a critical element. Back in 1936, Keynes had already introduced the time aspect to the economic model, which comprised finance as an essential component. Keynes's goal was to design an economic model where money never had a neutral value when it came to pricing. To achieve this, he created a model where financial assets' price level is determined in financial markets, and money's worth as an asset is derived from its liquidity. Additionally, each capital and financial asset generates an income stream that has carrying costs and varying liquidity degrees. The assets' price level is determined by the relative worth of liquidity and income, as per Keynes. (Minsky 1993)"," Minsky argued that incorporating a time dimension into an economic model is vital. As far back as 1936, Keynes had introduced the time element to the economic model, which included finance as a fundamental constituent of the model. Keynes' objective was to create an economic model that challenged the neutrality of money with regards to pricing. Keynes accomplished this by creating a model where the price level of financial assets is determined in financial markets, and the value of money as an asset is derived from its liquidity.

The assets' price level is influenced by the relative value of liquidity and income, according to Keynes. (Minsky 1993)"
" In the Keynes model of a financial system, time plays a crucial role in determining the value of a capital asset, which is a type of investment that generates income and can be sold in the future. Present-income and future liquidity are the two critical concepts that facilitate this time dependence. Present-income refers to the income stream generated by the asset in the present, while future liquidity refers to its potential value when sold later. The time dimension is represented by T1 (present-income) to T2 (future liquidity), and it is facilitated by borrowing and lending - the fundamental transaction in capitalist economies. Borrowers exchange money-in-the-present for money-in-the-future, which includes both the principal and interest repayments."," The concept of time plays an important role in the Keynes model of a financial system, particularly when it comes to the valuation of a capital asset. A capital asset is an investment that generates income and can be sold in the future. Present-income and future liquidity are two key concepts that describe this time dependence. Present-income refers to the income that the asset generates in the present, while future liquidity refers to its potential value when it is sold later. The time dimension is represented by T1 (present-income) and T2 (future liquidity) and is facilitated through the credit and debt transaction in a financial system. Capitalist economies rely on borrowing and lending, which involve exchanging money in the present for money that will be paid back in the future, with interest and principal included in the contract."," In a Keynesian model of a financial system, the factor of time is critical in the valuation of a capital asset.

" The financial system operates in a time dimension that comprises three phases, namely past (credit), present (interest payments), and future (debt repayment). For Keynesians, the temporal nature of credit and debt is crucial in modeling economic systems. A financial market ensures liquidity of capital assets based on their value. Keynes argued that the price level of assets depends on their income stream, carrying costs, and liquidity. In financial markets, the price of money serves as an asset whose worth comes from its liquidity. Future liquidity of credit-debt contracts is possible since financial markets provide such flexibility. Capital assets need current income and future liquidity to remain viable."," The time dimension is a fundamental aspect of a financial system, comprising three stages: credit as the past, interest payment as the present, and debt repayment as the future. Keynesians argue that economic models must include a temporal dimension because credit and debt are essentially time-sensitive financial processes. In the financial market, capital assets are valued based on their liquidity. In his General Theory, Keynes proposed a model where the price level of financial assets is determined in financial markets, and the price of money is an asset whose value comes from its liquidity. Financial markets enable credit-debt contracts to be sold in the future by providing future liquidity. Capital assets require both current income and future liquidity to remain viable, and the relative value of income in the future and liquidity now determines the price level of assets."," The temporal dimension is a crucial aspect of any financial system, encompassing credit as the past, interest payment as the present, and debt repayment as the future.

" The production subsystem was the primary focus of the Neo-Classical Synthesis School, with the present price of a commodity being the main element for controlling it. On the other hand, the Neo-Keynesian School was more concerned with the financial subsystem, where the future price of a capital asset acted as the crucial factor for control. Integrating both the economic models in a complementary framework posed a challenge, and a meta-framework such as societal dynamics theory can provide a methodological solution. This societal systems model employs a topological systems approach of a society, where an economy is an economic subsystem consisting of production and financial sub-subsystems. Detailed information regarding the development of this societal systems model can be found in Betz (2011)."," The Neo-Classical Synthesis School placed its emphasis on the production subsystem and the impact of the present price of a commodity on it.

" The societal dynamics topological model explains that there are four subsystems in an industrialized society, namely economic, cultural, political, and technological, and these can be represented by stacked planes as shown in Fig. 4. Traditionally, an economy is composed of three subsystems: production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The production subsystem transforms the energy and material resources into goods and services that are financed using a financial system. These goods and services are sold in the market, making it the third subsystem. Therefore, an economic system can be partitioned into four subsystems: production, market, finance, and resources. The exogenous school's model represents an economy as a production system, which is a subsystem of the economic system presented in the larger societal context. On the other hand, the endogenous school's model represents an economy as a financial system, which is viewed as the financial subsystem of the economic plane presented in the broader societal context."," The stasis of a society can be analyzed using the societal dynamics topological model.

The production subsystem, supported by a financial system, produces goods and services from material and energy resources. These goods and services are then consumed within a market, representing the third subsystem of an economic system. Consequently, any economic system can be decomposed into four subsystems: production, market, finance, and resources. This framework allowed the exogenous school to develop an economy model as a production system and to place it within the context of the larger societal framework, specifically as the production subsystem of the economic system. Similarly, the endogenous school's model considers an economy as a financial system, which can be viewed as the financial subsystem of the economic plane in the broader societal context."," The stasis of a society can be modeled using the societal dynamics topological model, which divides an industrialized society into four subsystems: economic, cultural, political, and technological.

" To distinguish between micro and macroeconomics, we initially incorporate partial models from different domains into microeconomics. For constructing a model of a productive economic agent, we utilize the standard ""enterprise model"" from management science, which was pioneered by Michael Porter. The productive organization can be represented as a framework that acquires resources and labor from its surroundings and then transforms them into items that are of greater value and can be sold back to the environment as outputs. This is a depiction of an open system model of a firm that takes inputs from the environment and produces value-added products for its customers."," The field of economics distinguishes between micro and macroeconomics.

" Economists are particularly interested in identifying the factors that influence economic growth and contribute to differences in per-capita real incomes across different countries. Although a significant amount of literature exists on this topic, empirical research has had only limited success in revealing the underlying causes of economic growth and the resultant inequalities. As a result, growth models have included an increasing number of explanatory variables, and by the end of the twentieth century, institutional factors had been added to the more traditional factors of labor, physical and human capital, and technology that were considered in neoclassical and endogenous growth models. (Olson 1982, 1996)."," Understanding the economic growth determinants and analyzing cross-national disparities in real incomes are key priorities for economists. Despite an abundance of literature on this topic, empirical research has been only moderately successful in identifying the underlying drivers of growth and inequality.

"Political freedom often combines civil liberties and political rights, however, they are two different concepts with differing effects on economic growth.

" ""Milton Friedman (2002) suggests the use of three classifications, namely economic, civil, and political freedom when talking about the different concepts of freedom.

On the other hand, civil freedom refers to human rights such as freedom of speech, assembly, and expression. The people of Hong Kong are a good example of this differentiation. During British rule, they enjoyed high levels of civil freedom but lacked political freedom according to Freedom House's criteria.

" The authors Ariel Benyishay and Roger Betancourt contend that the provision of civil liberties to protect human rights is an important indicator of the rule of law's prevalence in a society. When human rights are violated, individuals lose property rights, either through drastic measures like imprisonment or death, or by less overt limitations like restricted freedom of choice. To ensure effective market operation, the authors suggest that civil liberties represent an essential factor due to their constructed social nature, which promotes long-term economic development."," In their argument, Ariel Benyishay and Roger Betancourt highlight the importance of civil liberties in protecting human rights, which is a key indicator of the prevalence of the rule of law in a society.

The authors believe that civil liberties are socially constructed and are vital for the optimal functioning of markets, which can support long-term economic growth. As such, they suggest that there is a strong causal relationship between civil liberties and economic development over time."," According to Ariel Benyishay and Roger Betancourt, one of the most critical measures of the prevalence of the rule of law in a society is the protection of human rights through civil liberties.

The researchers also accounted for the potential time lag between institutional changes and their impact on economic growth by incorporating lag variables into their analysis."
" Growth theorists, who support the principles of property rights and some of North's contributions, argue that promoting economic freedom enhances productivity by decreasing transaction costs. This motivates the accumulation of human and physical capital stocks, encourages specialization and economies of scale, and fosters business innovation, ultimately resulting in more efficient organizations. Precise property rights are essential for the market to operate efficiently since the lack of them makes it difficult to allocate and distribute resources, resulting in exorbitant negotiation costs. Also, the lack of transparency and barriers to entry for new competitors or international competition adds transaction costs to the economy, limiting market opportunities. The highest accord has been achieved regarding the positive and significant impact of economic freedom on growth, making it the most important institutional characteristic. This view is supported by scholars such as Azman-Saini, Baharumshah and Law (2010), Carlsson and Lunsdtr?m (2002), Dawson (2003), De Vanssay and Spindler (1994), Easton and Walker (1997), the International Monetary Fund (2003), Justesen (2008), and Stroup (2007)."," Economic growth depends on the concepts of property rights school as well as some of North¡¯s ideas, which are embraced by growth theoreticians. They argue that economic freedom is crucial for increasing productivity by reducing transaction costs, leading to the accumulation of both human and physical capital stocks, specialization, economies of scale, and fostering business innovation. For the market to work efficiently, it needs specific and well-defined property rights, and without them, negotiation costs increase, which makes the allocation and distribution of resources expensive. Additionally, the lack of transparent information and entry barriers in the market imposes transaction costs that limit market opportunities. Scholars have achieved near-unanimous agreement concerning the positive and significant impact of economic freedom on growth. This fundamental institutional characteristic is widely welcomed, as demonstrated through the works of Azman-Saini, Baharumshah, and Law (2010), Carlsson and Lunsdtr?m (2002), Dawson (2003), De Vanssay and Spindler (1994), Easton and Walker (1997), the International Monetary Fund (2003), Justesen (2008), and Stroup (2007)."," Supporters of property rights and some of North's contributions among growth theorists assert that economic freedom and reduced transaction costs lead to increased productivity, encouraging the accumulation of human and physical capital stocks, facilitating specialization and economies of scale, promoting efficient organizations, and stimulating business innovation.

" In recent times, many studies have focused on regulation as an essential aspect of economic freedom, specifically its effect on growth. Researchers have concluded that regulation has negative effects on growth, as evidenced by empirical studies. Cole and colleagues have examined Latin America's TFP, and they believe the region's barriers to international and domestic competition are the main reason behind its low TFP. Dawson concluded that reducing regulation boosts growth through two channels, namely the investment and total factor productivity (TFP) channels. In addition, Licerio, Fullerton, and Clark suggest that deregulation leads to an increase in per capita income by reducing regulatory burdens."," Economic freedom's regulation aspect has received attention in recent years, particularly its impact on growth.

" Robert Barro in 1996 argued that there is a non-linear relationship between democracy and growth. He proposed that countries with lower levels of political freedom can see growth with higher levels of democracy as it limits government abuse. However, in countries that already have moderate levels of political freedom, high levels of democracy can hinder growth. Barro contended that there is a threshold to widening political freedom and doing so beyond that point could actually slow down growth. This is partially due to redistributive pressures."," According to Robert Barro in 1996, the relationship between democracy and growth is non-linear.

" The satisfactory conception of freedom proposed by Amartya Sen (1999) involves recognizing the interconnectedness of all freedoms as both intrinsic and instrumental. Political and social freedoms are considered desirable and conducive to economic growth.

" It is widely acknowledged that economic freedom is conducive to growth. However, the significance of economic, social, and political freedoms in enhancing people's overall capabilities must not be ignored. Sen's instrumental perspective identifies five types of freedom: political, economic, social, transparency, and security, all of which are interrelated.

" Based on empirical research from Giavazzi and Tabellini (2005) and Persson and Tabellini (2006), it is argued that liberalizing the economy is a crucial first step before the expansion of political rights can lead to economic growth. Closed economies with emerging democracies often face distributional conflicts, while established democracies that operate in open economies need to prioritize economic efficiency. Economic liberalization also fosters the rule of law, and enhances protection of property rights, which are prerequisites for democracy to generate economic growth (Giavazzi and Tabellini, 2005)."," Empirical studies conducted by Giavazzi and Tabellini (2005) and Persson and Tabellini (2006) suggest that liberalizing the economy is an essential initial step in creating an environment for political rights expansion and economic growth. Democracies that are just beginning and operate in closed economies face issues with redistribution, while established democracies in open economies need to prioritize economic efficiency. Additionally, economic liberalization promotes the rule of law and improved protection of property rights, both of which are prerequisites for democracy to create economic growth (Giavazzi and Tabellini, 2005)."," The argument put forth by Giavazzi and Tabellini (2005) and Persson and Tabellini (2006) based on empirical studies, claims that liberalizing the economy is necessary before expanding political rights to achieve economic growth. Newly formed democracies in closed economies face the obstacle of redistribution, whereas established democracies in open economies prioritize economic efficiency. Furthermore, economic liberalization encourages better implementation of the rule of law and strengthens the protection of property rights, making them prerequisite factors for democracy to generate economic growth (Giavazzi and Tabellini, 2005)."
" Political freedom and economic freedom are often studied empirically (Farr, Lord, and Wolfenbarger 1998; Helliwell 1994; Wu and Davis 1999). While both measures are important, economic freedom tends to produce more robust results due to a clearer cost-benefit relationship. Research on the relationship between democracy and economic growth has produced mixed results. Some studies indicate that democracy has a positive impact on economic growth (Gwartney, Lawson, and Block 1996; Hanke and Walters 1997; Rigobon and Rodrik 2005; Rodrik 1999a; Scully 1988; Varsakelis 2006). However, other studies find that the relationship is insignificant (Alesina et al. 1996; Ali and Crain 2002; Barro and Sala-iMartin 1995; De Haan and Siermann 1995, 1996; Mulligan, Gil, and Sala-i-Martin 2004) or even slightly negative (Helliwell 1994; Tavares and Wacziarg 2001)."," In empirical research, political freedom is often used as an indicator of civil liberties and political rights globally (Farr, Lord, and Wolfenbarger 1998; Helliwell 1994; Wu and Davis 1999).

" The timing of complex causal relationships between institutional factors and economic outcomes tends to be overlooked in empirical research. Although certain effects may occur at the same time, others may have a delayed structure. Economic progress is one example of this, as it may need a certain period of time before significant developments are seen. Trustworthiness is then of great importance in the process of growth, particularly in countries that have historically faced inconsistent policies and those with a strong aversion to liberalization policies."," When it comes to empirical research, the timing of complex causal relationships between institutional factors and economic outcomes is often disregarded. While some effects may occur concurrently, others may have a lagged structure. Economic freedom is a prime example of this, as it may require time to generate tangible progress.

" It is necessary to acknowledge the difference between the direct and indirect effects of institutional quality on growth, an aspect that is often overlooked and has led to diverging views. The impact of economic freedom on growth is a subject of debate, with some scholars contending that its effect is greater on productivity than on the accumulation of productive factors, while others argue that it enhances growth by improving both total factor productivity and the accumulation of human and physical capital. A few academics emphasize the importance of efficiency in resource allocation as the primary driver of growth, while others give priority to investment as the means to stimulate growth."," The distinction between the direct and indirect impacts of institutional quality on growth should be considered, as it has been largely ignored and caused a lack of agreement among scholars. Regarding economic freedom's influence on growth, there are varying opinions; some argue that it benefits productivity more than the accumulation of productive factors, while others believe it enhances growth by improving both total factor productivity and the accumulation of human and physical capital.

" In the domain of political freedom, the viewpoint that democracy promotes economic growth while also facilitating the accumulation of human capital is supported by several authors (Mariscal and Sokoloff 2000). However, the evidence for physical capital is not as clear-cut. Authors like Jos¨¦ Tavares and Romain Wacziarg (2001), Philipp Harms and Heinrich Ursprung (2002), and Matthias Busse (2004) have found that democratic nations tend to attract more foreign direct investment. At the same time, Adam and Filippaios (2007) argue that democracy could have a detrimental effect on private investment. According to Jos¨¦ Aixal¨¢ and Gema Fabro (2009), economic liberty is the only critical factor in physical capital investment, but for human capital investment, both economic and political freedoms play a crucial role."," The idea that democracy could stimulate economic growth and enhance the accumulation of human capital is supported by some scholars in the realm of political freedom (Mariscal and Sokoloff 2000).

" To enhance our comprehension of the procedures involved in economic growth, it is crucial to clarify these routes. Additionally, when utilizing the accumulation of human and physical capital as explanatory variables in the regressions, it should be considered that the institutional variable coefficient is not indicative of the overall effect on economic growth, and thus, it may lead to erroneous conclusions. Therefore, employing simultaneous equation models is recommended to overcome this challenge, although they are underutilized in research (with only a few exceptions noted in the studies of Alesina et al. 1996; Faruk, Kamel and V¨¦ganzon¨¨s-Varoudakis 2006; Leite and Weidman 2002; Rigobon and Rodrik 2005)."," Gaining a better understanding of the processes behind economic growth can be achieved by clarifying these channels.

" Institutional change can prove to be a complex and time-consuming process due to the historic and cultural foundations of a country's institutions, often leading to opposition by those who prefer the status quo. However, it is crucial to consider the temporal aspect, as institutional changes can progress rapidly in developing countries. For example, according to the IMF, since the mid-1980s, there has been worldwide progress in establishing the rule of law, with notable advancements in the early 1990s. Furthermore, Central and Eastern European countries that underwent economic and political reforms have experienced substantial institutional developments. Additionally, the IMF has cited changes in states like Afghanistan and Kosovo as examples of significant institutional changes in post-conflict regions."," Institutional changes can be challenging to execute due to the deep-seated roots of a country's cultural and historical institutions.

" Institutional dimensions, when analyzed separately, display predicted signs and significant results. According to neoclassical theory, the growth equation has negative initial income sign which turned out to be significant in eight out of nine estimations, thereby validating the hypothesis of convergence. Positive and statistically significant coefficients were found for the investment in physical and human capital variables, but only the physical one showed expected signs in all nine equations. The rate of enrollment in primary education and openness in the first equation, as well as the lagged rate of enrollment in primary education and initial income in the second, were all positively signed and had high levels of significance in all estimations of both the physical and human capital investment equations."," When the institutional dimensions are analyzed individually, all the traditional variables demonstrate the expected signs and are typically significant. As projected by neoclassical theory, the growth equation displays a negative initial income sign that is significantly observed in eight of the nine calculations, thereby confirming the hypothesis of convergence. The variables pertaining to investment in physical and human capital display positive and statistically significant coefficients, except for human capital, which is not significant in three of the nine equations despite representing the expected sign in all cases. Furthermore, in both equations for investment in physical and human capital, explanatory variables such as the rate of enrollment in primary education and openness for the first equation, and the lagged rate of enrollment in primary education and initial income for the second equation, exhibit the expected positive sign and a high degree of significance across all estimations."," Considering institutional dimensions separately, all the traditional variables present anticipated signs and display significant outcomes. As per the predictions of neoclassical theory, the growth equation manifests a negative initial income sign that appears significant in eight out of the nine estimations, thereby verifying the convergence hypothesis. The coefficients of physical and human capital investment variables demonstrate positivity and statistical significance, except for human capital, which, despite having anticipated signs in all cases, is not significant in three out of nine equations. In the equations that detail investment in physical and human capital, explanatory variables such as the rate of enrollment in primary education and openness in the first equation, and the lagged rate of enrollment in primary education and initial income in the second equation, depict the anticipated positive sign and retain a high level of significance in all estimations."
" The results pertaining to the institutional variables studied highlight the significant impact of economic freedom (as observed in Table 1) on growth by enhancing resource allocation and encouraging investment in physical and human capital. Additionally, economic freedom is highly significant in all three equations of the system (systems 1 and 2). Moreover, introducing two lags in the analysis (system 3) leads to maintaining the significance of economic freedom in the equation of physical capital investment, and consequently improving the efficacy of the model."," The study's examination of institutional variables reveals compelling results, with economic freedom (as shown in Table 1) contributing significantly to growth through its enhancement of resource allocation and increased investment in physical and human capital. Notably, economic freedom possesses high significance in all three equations of the system (systems 1 and 2). When the analysis involves two lags (system 3), economic freedom continues to retain its significance in the physical capital investment equation, leading to an enhancement of the model's explanatory power."," Based on the institutional variables that were studied, economic freedom (Table 1) emerges as a crucial factor in promoting growth. This is because it leads to improved resource allocation and encourages investment in physical and human capital, resulting in significant impacts on all three equations of the system (systems 1 and 2).

" The results obtained empirically validate the concepts of the property rights school and the contributions made by North (1990) and Olson (1982), which were later included in growth theory, regarding the crucial role of economic freedom in promoting the accumulation of physical and human capital, reducing transaction costs, and increasing productivity. The presence of civil liberties (Table 2) and political rights (Table 3) makes a significant difference in driving growth as they help in improving resource allocation and investment in physical and human capital (systems 1, 2, and 3). Even when we consider two lags of the variables, civil liberties and political rights retain their significance across the three equations, leading to improved explanatory power in the models."," The results derived from empirical evidence provide support for the notions presented by the property rights school and the contributions made by North (1990) and Olson (1982), which were subsequently integrated into growth theory, concerning the critical role played by economic freedom in facilitating the accumulation of physical and human capital, lowering transaction costs, and enhancing productivity. The existence of civil liberties (Table 2) and political rights (Table 3) is found to be critical in promoting growth since it drives resource allocation and investment in physical and human capital (systems 1, 2, and 3). Analyzing the variables with two lags indicates that the importance of civil liberties and political rights prevails across all three equations, leading to a marked improvement in the model's explanatory power."," The empirical findings validate the ideas originating from the property rights school and observations made by North (1990) and Olson (1982), which were later incorporated into growth theory, regarding the vital role played by economic freedom in encouraging the accumulation of human and physical capital, mitigating transaction costs, and enhancing productivity. The presence of civil liberties (Table 2) and political rights (Table 3) is pivotal in driving growth by aiding resource allocation and promoting investment in physical and human capital (systems 1, 2, and 3). When considering two lags of the variables, the significance of civil liberties and political rights remains in all three equations, thereby increasing the model's explanatory capability."
" According to additional research papers (Gwartney, Lawson and Holcombe 1999; Hanke and Walters 1997; Stroup 2007), it's substantiated that economic freedom holds more prominence in stimulating growth in comparison to civil liberties and political rights. An examination of Table 4 indicates that the current values display superior coefficients for this institutional dimension. Nonetheless, it's important to note that civil liberties have a coefficient almost the same as economic freedom in the case of human capital, and when variables lags are integrated, economic freedom's predominance becomes less significant."," Additional studies (Gwartney, Lawson and Holcombe 1999; Hanke and Walters 1997; Stroup 2007) provide further support for the notion that economic freedom has a greater effect on growth compared to civil liberties and political rights. When considering current values, Table 4 reveals more superior coefficients for this institutional dimension. However, it should be noted that civil liberties have a coefficient that is nearly as large in the case of human capital, and including lags in variables causes economic freedom to lose its supremacy."," Other academic research (Gwartney, Lawson and Holcombe 1999; Hanke and Walters 1997; Stroup 2007) lends support to the idea that economic freedom has a greater impact on growth than civil liberties and political rights. The results presented in Table 4 show superior coefficients for this institutional dimension when current values are used. However, it is important to note that for human capital, civil liberties have a coefficient that is almost as sizable as that for economic freedom.

" The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of economic liberalization on economic growth in Pakistan from 1971 to 2011 in both short and long terms. Liberalization of the economy covers changes in both trade and financial sector. Principal component analysis was conducted to create an economic liberalization index for this study that contributes to the extant literature. Our findings indicate that economic liberalization reforms foster economic growth positively in the short term, while trade liberalization adversely affects economic growth in the long run. Further, the study reveals unstable impacts of economic liberalization on real GDP during the sample period under the rolling window approach. Finally, policymakers should focus more on human capital development through higher education expenditures and financial reforms like sectoral credit allocation to facilitate Pakistan's economic growth."," The primary goal of the research is to analyze the influence of economic liberalization on the economic growth of Pakistan from 1971 to 2011 in both the short and long term.

" The connection between economic liberalization (EL) and economic growth (EG) has garnered significant attention from scholars, particularly after the emergence of new growth theories. In the 1980s, many developing countries, inspired by the endogenous growth theory model, initiated liberalization to achieve EG. Complete liberalization requires the liberalization of both the financial and trade sectors. Nevertheless, there is no conclusive empirical evidence on the outcomes of financial and trade liberalization."," The relationship between economic liberalization (EL) and economic growth (EG) has been a prominent area of research since the rise of new growth theories. In the 1980s, many developing countries adopted the endogenous growth theory model to promote EG through liberalization. This entailed the liberalization of both the financial and trade sectors. Despite this, empirical evidence on the effects of liberalizing both the financial and trade sectors remains uncertain."," Following the emergence of new growth theories, the connection between economic liberalization (EL) and economic growth (EG) has become a topic of substantial interest for researchers. In the 1980s, many developing countries embraced the endogenous growth theory model to achieve EG by pursuing liberalization.

Nonetheless, there is no consensus on the empirical findings on the impacts of financial and trade liberalization."
" Pakistan decided to implement financial sector liberalization in the late 1980s as a means of achieving three objectives: enhancing the efficiency of financial markets, formulating more efficient monetary and credit policies that are based on market mechanisms, and strengthening the financial institutions that are based on markets and capital."," In the late 1980s, Pakistan embarked on a process of financial sector liberalization with a three-pronged agenda. These included improving the effectiveness of financial markets, developing market-oriented, more efficient monetary and credit policies and strengthening the institutional capacity of financial institutions based on capital and markets."," During the late 1980s, Pakistan initiated the process of liberalizing its financial sector with three key objectives in mind.

" To estimate cointegration tests, the SBC method is utilized in this study to find the optimum lag order as the JJ Cointegration approach is highly sensitive to the lag order. The trace test results from Table 5 indicate that a cointegration relationship exists in models 1-12. However, the cointegration vector varies across the models; models 1, 3, 4, 9, and 10 have one cointegrating vector while models 2, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 12 have two cointegrating vectors.

" The rolling window regression method is employed to assess the stability of variable coefficients during the selected data period. The cointegration econometric techniques currently available presume that coefficient estimates are unaffected throughout the sampled data. However, the economy's dynamics continuously change, resulting in fluctuations in economic indicators. As a result, the estimated coefficients of economic indicators cannot remain constant throughout the sample."," Rolling window regression is utilized to examine the consistency of variable coefficients within a specified data timeframe. The cointegration econometric approaches available assume that the coefficient estimates of the model would remain steady throughout the sample. However, in reality, the economy undergoes fluctuations due to changing economic indicators. As a result, the estimated coefficients of such economic indicators cannot remain constant throughout the sample period."," The rolling window regression method is applied to verify the stability of variable coefficients within the selected data period.

" To determine the relationship between growth and financial system, it is important to take into account long series and control structural changes. Focusing on Portugal, which is a smaller economy, allows us to analyze the impact of structural changes in more detail. The period of the 1990s and 2000s had significant economic and political changes, making it an ideal time to study the interaction of variables. Since Portugal is not an Anglo-Saxon country, the banking system is predicted to have more influence on the economy than the stock market."," Examining the correlation between growth and the financial system requires analyzing long time series while accounting for structural changes. In order to investigate the impact of structural changes in a smaller economy, Portugal is selected as the case study. The late 1990s and early 2000s were a time of extensive economic and political changes, offering a valuable opportunity to study variable interactions. Portugal, as a non-Anglo-Saxon country, is expected to have a more influential banking system vis-¨¤-vis the stock market in terms of the wider economy."," To determine the relationship between economic growth and the financial system, it is essential to consider long-term series data and control for any structural changes.

" The concept of stock market development lacks a clear definition. However, to study this development, four indicators (market capitalization, volatility, institutional development, and regulation indicators) proposed by Demirgu?-Kunt and Levine (1996) can be used. In addition, measuring the banking system is essential, and ratios of domestic credit to GDP or nominal money supply (monetary aggregate M2) to nominal GDP can be utilized for this purpose. Other factors, including inflation, are also sometimes considered in the model."," Despite the fact that the definition of stock market development is not entirely clear, there are four metrics proposed by Demirgu?-Kunt and Levine (1996) that can be utilized to analyze it: market capitalization, volatility, institutional development, and regulation indicators.

" Financial development due to endogenous growth processes is a well-explored concept in existing literature (for example, Bose and Cothren, 1997; Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1990). All variables are connected, and thus, endogenous adjustment brings about effects, requiring the use of the VAR technique. This technique views variables as potentially endogenous and evaluates relationships without requiring the differentiation of endogenous and exogenous variables, unlike the simultaneous equations model. Researchers like Caporale et al.

" The study's findings suggest that in order to conduct an accurate analysis of the contribution of the stock market to economic growth, it is important to consider specific variables as exogenous, including the constant, seasonal dummies, one impulse dummy during the second quarter of 2000, and two shift dummies. Controlling for the physical introduction of the euro notes and coins or integration in Euronext is essential, as is controlling for the subprime crisis that occurred from the last quarter of 2008 in Portugal. The results of the VAR model also indicate that the physical introduction of the euro had a greater impact on the economy than the integration in Euronext. The shift dummy is highly statistically significant in the GDP and stock market equations, with a negative signal that suggests a negative effect on the economy."," According to the results, an accurate analysis of the stock market's impact on economic growth requires considering certain variables as exogenous.

" This paper examines the impact of both stock markets and bank financing on economic growth and highlights the significance of comprehending this contribution when designing policies for growth. If the growth response varies across the two systems due to innovative changes, then policymakers need to prioritize taking action towards the more responsive system."," The primary focus of this paper is to evaluate how economic growth is influenced by stock markets and bank financing systems, and it stresses the essentiality of fully grasping this relationship when creating growth-oriented economic policies.

" The competing systems have been found to be different based on Granger causality, variance decomposition, and impulse response function measures. Fig. 3 shows that an innovation in one system leads to a decrease in the relative weight of the other system. Bank financing responds more rapidly and strongly to innovations in the stock market, while the stock market responds less to bank financing. This reveals that bank financing is more self-contained compared to the stock market. This result was unexpected, given that Portugal is a non-Anglo-Saxon country, and companies are expected to rely heavily on bank financing, which should play a significant role in fueling Portuguese economic growth."," According to the Granger causality, variance decomposition, and impulse response function metrics, the competing systems differ from each other. The weight of one system decreases when there is any innovation in the other system, as evidenced in Fig. 3. The impact of an innovation in the stock market on bank financing is more noticeable and quicker than the vice versa. In general, bank financing is more insular than the stock market. This finding was a surprise since Portugal is a non-Anglo-Saxon country and is assumed to have widespread bank financing in corporations, making bank lending play a crucial role in the economic growth of Portugal."," The competing systems have been distinguished from each other based on the Granger causality, variance decomposition, and impulse response function.

This discovery was not foreseen, given that Portugal is a non-Anglo-Saxon country, and bank financing is thought to be widespread in companies and play a key role in Portuguese economic growth."
" The findings obtained from Table 5 corroborate with the outcomes of the exogeneity tests. All variables exhibit a dynamic pattern, which is necessary regarding endogeneity (refer to Table 5 and Fig. 3). DLY events show an impact of about 85% to the forecast error variance after a two-quarter lag, which gradually decreases to around 59% towards the end of the ten-quarter period. In contrast, DLS shocks considerably impact forecast error variance when compared to DLB, explaining approximately 15.5% and 3%, respectively, at the end of the ten-quarter period. The shocks to DLI consistently gain strength, quintupling from 2.5% to 5.8% in explaining the forecast error variance.

After a lag of two-quarters, DLY triggers events that explain approximately 85% of the forecast error variance, which diminishes to roughly 59% at the end of the ten-quarter period. A comparison between the impact of shocks to DLS and DLB on the forecast error variance highlights that DLS has a considerably greater impact, elucidating about 15.5% of the variance at the end of the ten-quarter period, while DLB accounts for roughly 3%. The impact of shocks to DLI increases consistently, surging from approximately 2.5% to 5.8% in explaining the forecast error variance. As expected, models that incorporate financial determinants necessitate the control for nominal effects. Ultimately, at the end of ten-quarters, the shocks to DLP clarify around 16.6% of the forecast error variance."
" The research aims to evaluate the impact of stock market development on the economic growth of Portugal between 1993 and 2011. Portugal is a small economy that faces significant changes in its structure; hence the study will conduct a comparison to determine the effects of two different financing systems, stock market and bank financing, on the country's economic growth. The study detected no correlation between the two financing systems. The researchers utilized a VAR model with exogenous impulse and shift dummies, which is a suitable technique for analyzing the contribution of stock market and bank financing to economic growth. However, the study acknowledges the need to consider specific Portuguese idiosyncrasies to ensure that causal relationships among variables are not distorted, leading to incorrect conclusions."," In this article, the goal is to assess the influence of stock market development on economic growth in Portugal during the period of 1993 to 2011. Because Portugal is a small economy, the study considers the impact on economic growth caused by structural changes that occur. Furthermore, the study explores which financing system between bank financing and stock market financing contributes more to economic growth. The study did not find any correlation that could explain the relationship between the two competing financing systems. To evaluate the contribution of these financing systems to Portugal's economic growth, the study used a VAR model with exogenous impulse and shift dummies. However, the study emphasizes the need to consider idiosyncrasies unique to Portugal to avoid incorrect conclusions due to omitted variable bias."," This research aims to analyze the impact of stock market development on Portugal's economic growth between 1993 to 2011. The study focuses on Portugal because it is a small economy that regularly experiences structural changes that can affect its growth. The study also investigates the effects of bank financing versus stock market financing on growth rates. There was no evidence of a cointegration relationship. The researchers used a VAR model with exogenous impulse and shift dummies to examine the relative contributions of the two financing systems to economic growth. However, to obtain accurate results from the study, it is essential to consider specific factors unique to Portugal that could impact the relationship between the variables. Failure to do so could result in misleading or incorrect conclusions."
" The financial system is composed of two components, and their behaviors have been observed. One component, namely the stock market, has a positive causal relationship with economic growth. The relationship is bilateral, indicating that the stock market drives economic growth, and economic growth in turn promotes stock market development. In contrast, the banking system benefits from economic growth but does not contribute to it. Therefore, policymakers should prioritize the promotion of stock market development over bank financing to stimulate economic growth. Furthermore, more research is needed to understand the interaction between financial markets and different aspects of economic growth."," Two distinct behaviors have been identified within the financial system's components. The stock market component exhibits a positive causal relationship with economic growth. This relationship is bidirectional in nature, as the stock market plays a crucial role in driving economic growth, while economic growth promotes the development of the stock market. Conversely, the banking system seems to benefit from economic growth without contributing much to it. Therefore, economic policies should prioritize the promotion of stock market development over bank financing to enhance economic growth. There is scope for further research to explore the channels through which different financial markets interact with economic growth."," In the financial system, there are two components - the stock market and the banking system - that exhibit different behaviors. The stock market has a positive causal relationship with economic growth, and this relationship is bidirectional. This means that the stock market affects economic growth, and economic growth, in turn, promotes the development of the stock market. On the other hand, the banking system seems to be a net beneficiary of economic growth, but it does not contribute significantly to promoting economic growth. Hence, economic policies should focus on promoting the development of the stock market, rather than relying on bank financing, to drive economic growth. Research should also be conducted to understand how different financial markets interact with economic growth."
" Through the control variables, the Portuguese reality was analyzed and proven. The research found that investment did not have a significant impact on the overall economy and there was a noticeable decrease in economic price competitiveness.

" We analyzed economic voting in times of financial crisis using data from individual-level surveys carried out during the Canadian elections in 2008 and 2011. Our hypothesis is that during a crisis, the effect of the economy on incumbent voting can be divided into two parts. The first impact is traditional in nature, and it is based on an assessment of past economic conditions, which are inevitably adverse due to the crisis. The second impact is determined by perceptions of the parties' competence in handling the economy, and the competence effect can make up for any incumbent vote losses that may result from the economic downturn. To be more precise, by looking at issue ownership based on competence, we can incorporate a neglected valence component into the economic voting model."," We examined economic voting during financial crisis periods by utilizing survey data gathered from individual-level respondents who took part in the Canadian Election Studies of 2008 and 2011. Our premise is that the effect of the economy on incumbent voting during such times can be explained through two factors. Firstly, there is the traditional impact that arises due to retrospective evaluations of the national economic state, which is inevitably unfavorable during crises. Secondly, there is a perception-based impact that depends on the parties' competence in managing the economic conditions, and this competence effect can stand in for incumbent vote losses that may result from bad economic times (traditional effect). By considering competence-based issue ownership, we can account for a previously-neglected valence component in the economic voting model."," In order to investigate economic voting during periods of financial crisis, we utilized data from individual-level surveys conducted during the 2008 and 2011 Canadian Election Studies.

The second factor involves perceptions of the parties' competence in managing the economy, and the competence effect can potentially offset any incumbent vote losses from bad economic times (traditional effect).

" According to the theory of voting behavior, the economy is a valence issue, where the majority of political parties and voters agree that economic growth is a desirable goal (Stokes, 1963). Essentially, there is a widespread consensus among parties and voters on this subject, because of the importance of economic development for the entire society. Therefore, the main factor that affects voters is whether the government accomplishes this objective or not. A government that can achieve the target stands a higher chance of being re-elected in the following election. On the other hand, if it fails to produce results, it faces the possibility of being voted out of office."," The economy is commonly regarded as a valence issue in voting behavior theory (Stokes, 1963), where a majority of parties and voters agree that economic growth is a desirable objective in democratic societies. Since there is a shared understanding of what needs to be achieved economically for society as a whole, parties and voters are generally united in their stance on this matter. However, what matters most to voters is the actual delivery of this goal by the government. If the government can deliver the desired outcome, it has a more significant chance of being re-elected in the next election. However, if it falls short of the expectations, it faces a real risk of being voted out of office."," As per the voting behavior theory, the economy is perceived as a valence issue (Stokes, 1963), where the majority of political parties and voters favor economic growth as a desirable goal in democratic societies. This implies that there is broad agreement among parties and voters on this matter, and a shared perspective of what economic advancement means for the betterment of society. However, voting decisions are contingent on whether the government is successful in achieving this objective. If the government can effectively deliver on its promises, it has a higher chance of being reelected. In contrast, if the government fails to attain this goal, it risks being voted out of office."
" The notion of 'traditional economic voting' expectancy was coined by Lewis-Beck in 1988, and it serves as the fundamental concept of a valence model of economic voting as described by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau in 2011. According to this model, voters evaluate the government's previous performance and cast their vote based on that review, effectively holding the government responsible for the economic state of their country."," In 1988, Lewis-Beck introduced the idea of 'traditional economic voting' expectation, which later formed the basis of a valence model of economic voting, as explained by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau in 2011. According to this model, voters evaluate the government's past economic performance and then cast their vote, holding the government accountable for the recent economic changes in their country."," Lewis-Beck coined the term 'traditional economic voting' expectation in 1988, which paved the way for a valence model of economic voting, as outlined by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau in 2011. The model proposes that voters scrutinize the government's past economic record and use their judgment to cast their ballot, making the government answerable for the economic state of their nation."
" The valence model of economic voting mainly concerns itself with voters' assessments of economic conditions retrospectively. However, it is not surprising to think that voters also take into account the ability of different political parties to tackle the issues. The competence of the political parties is a vital element in the valence model of political choice. As a result, there is an increasing focus on examining the influence of the perception of party efficiency in managing the economy on an individual's vote choice. A range of studies has started to investigate this aspect of voting, emphasizing the importance of party performance in economic management."," The current formulation of the valence model of economic voting is primarily concerned with voters' retrospective evaluations of the economic situation. Although it is reasonable to expect voters to respond to recent economic changes, it is also plausible that voters consider the competency of political parties in managing economic issues. The reputation of political parties as adept political actors is a vital part of the valence model of political choice. Consequently, an emerging body of research aims to examine the effect of attitudes towards party competence in economic management on voters' decision-making. This line of inquiry stresses the relevance of party performance in economic management as a critical factor in determining voter behavior."," The current formulation of the valence model of economic voting primarily takes into account voters' assessments of previous economic conditions. While it is reasonable to anticipate voters would react to recent shifts in economic conditions, it is also conceivable that they consider the competence of political parties in managing economic issues.

As a result, a growing number of studies have begun to analyze the impact of perceptions of party competence in managing the economy on vote choice and behavior. This growing body of literature underlines the significance of party performance in economic management as a critical determinant of voter behavior."
" This article aims to unify the valence dimensions of economic voting into a single model for incumbent vote. Prior research on the valence model has mainly focused on retrospective evaluations of the economy, overlooking the issue of ownership. However, there have been a few exceptions to this, which we have taken into account. Particularly in the case of an economic crisis, incorporating both of these dimensions seems to be essential. An economic crisis can have a two-part impact on incumbent voting. Firstly, the traditional effect based on retrospective evaluations of the economy, which will inevitably be negative. Secondly, there is an impact based on the public's views on the parties' ability to manage the economy.  The level of influence will be subject to the public's current view, but it could offset incumbent vote losses that result from the poor economic circumstances."," The objective of this article is to integrate the two valence dimensions of economic voting into a cohesive model for incumbent vote. The valence model of economic voting has thus far prioritized the effects of retrospective economic assessments, with little attention given to issue ownership. Yet, some studies have spotlighted this second dimension, which we have incorporated into the model. This is particularly important during an economic crisis. In such a scenario, the effect of the economy on incumbent voting can be expected to have two components. Firstly, there is the traditional contingent that is based on retrospective evaluations of national economic conditions - which in this case, will inevitably be unfavorable. Secondly, there is an effect that is rooted in how the public perceives the parties' management of the economy. Depending on these perceptions, the competence effect may counterbalance any incumbent vote losses that result from the unfavorable economic circumstances."," The goal of this article is to merge the two valence dimensions of economic voting into a unified model for incumbent vote. Past research on the valence model of economic voting has largely neglected the issue of ownership, focusing mainly on retroactive economic evaluations. However, a few studies have highlighted this second aspect, which we have integrated into our model. This is especially pertinent during an economic crisis. In such a situation, we can anticipate that economic voting will have a twofold impact. First, there is the conventional impact that is rooted in retrospective evaluations of national economic conditions, which will inevitably be negative due to the crisis. Second, there is a perception-based effect that is rooted in how the public perceives the parties' management of the economy. Depending on these perceptions, the competence effect may offset any incumbent vote losses that occur as a result of the unfavorable economic situation."
" Utilizing survey-based analyses of the vote that the incumbent Conservative Party of Canada received in the federal elections of 2008 and 2011, we have demonstrated the dual effects empirically. The outcome of both these elections showed that the Conservatives were re-elected, despite the economic crisis context, which implies that the traditional economic voting hypothesis may not be sufficient to explain the role that the economy plays as a valence issue in determining election outcomes."," We have shown the dual effects through empirical evidence obtained from survey-based analyses of the vote for or against the incumbent Conservative Party of Canada in the 2008 and 2011 federal elections. The fact that the Conservative Party managed to win both elections, even with the economic crisis at hand, suggests that the conventional economic voting hypothesis might not be enough to explain the role of the economy as a valence issue in electoral outcomes."," By utilizing survey-based analyses of the vote that the incumbent Conservative Party of Canada received in the federal elections of 2008 and 2011, we have gathered empirical evidence that shows the dual effects.

From this observation, one can infer that the traditional economic voting hypothesis may fall short of explaining the role of the economy as a valence issue in determining election outcomes."
" In Canada, five federal elections coincided with serious economic crises or followed them closely. Notably, in three of these elections (1974, 2008, and 2011), the political incumbent was able to win re-election. In contrast, the incumbents experienced severe losses in the other two elections (1984 and 1993). These outcomes contradict the traditional economic voting theory that predicts the incumbent's defeat in all five elections. The authors seek to explain this phenomenon by distinguishing between two valence dimensions of economic voting: the classic dimension and the issue-ownership dimension. They examine two of the Canadian elections more closely to test their proposed explanation. The following sections provide a more thorough discussion of their theoretical reasoning and expectations."," Canada has seen five federal elections held amidst or just after serious economic crises. Surprisingly, in three of these elections (1974, 2008, and 2011), the incumbent party was successful in securing another term. Conversely, the incumbents suffered humiliating defeats in the other two elections (1984 and 1993). These results contradict the classic economic voting theory that expects the defeat of the incumbent party in all five elections. The authors offer an explanation that is based on two valence dimensions of economic voting, namely the classic dimension, and the issue ownership dimension. They delve deeper into two of the Canadian elections to put their hypothesis through rigorous testing. The subsequent sections elaborate further on their theoretical considerations and expected outcomes."," Over the years, Canada has witnessed five federal elections that were held during, or shortly after, major economic crises. What's interesting is that the incumbent party won three out of the five elections (in 1974, 2008, and 2011) but lost spectacularly in the other two (in 1984 and 1993). This presents a paradoxical situation that contrasts with the conventional economic voting theory that would forecast the loss of the incumbent in each case. In response, the authors of this article have come up with an explanation based on two valence dimensions of economic voting: the traditional dimension and the issue-ownership dimension. Further, they test their hypothesis by studying two of the five Canadian elections in greater detail. The following sections elaborate on their theoretical considerations and envisaged outcomes."
" The economy and incumbent voting are said to be connected according to the principle of government accountability. Governments are held accountable for the evolution of economic conditions, and citizens' approval of the governing party is based on whether the economy is doing well or not. In the past, most studies on the impact of economic conditions on support for incumbent governments have been conducted in the United States. However, research has also revealed a similar relationship in most other Western democracies. Recent comparative studies have been conducted on this topic, examining either the role of institutional arrangements or the level of sophistication among voters to emphasize the conditionality of the economy-vote relationship. Notable studies in this area include Duch and Stevenson's (2008) and Nadeau et al's (2013). Additionally, Powell and Whitten's (1993) and Anderson's (2007) studies focused on the complexity of this relationship."," The existence of a link between the economy and incumbent voting is based on the principle of government accountability. This means that governments are held accountable, to a certain extent, for the economic conditions of their country, and the governing party is rewarded or punished depending on whether they have improved or worsened the economy. The relationship between economic conditions and support for incumbent governments has mainly been studied in the United States, with several studies such as those conducted by Key (1966), Kramer (1971), Fiorina (1981), Kiewiet (1983), and Lewis-Beck (1988). However, similar findings have been discovered in other Western democracies, and recent comparative studies have looked into factors such as institutional arrangements and voters' level of sophistication to better understand the relationship between the economy and voting patterns. Studies by Powell and Whitten (1993) and Anderson (2007) have emphasized the complexity of this relationship."," The theory of a correlation between the economy and incumbent voting is founded on the principle of government accountability.

" The 'valence' model of economic voting is the core concept proposed by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011). They differentiate it from the policy-oriented economic voting and patrimonial economic voting models. The policy-oriented economic voting model reflects diverging opinions of voters on economic policies, while patrimonial economic voting depends on the voter's financial assets. The study by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011) shows that economic voting is a multidimensional phenomenon. In this article, we argue that incorporating another dimension, party competence, to the valence model of economic voting would make it multidimensional. Hence, we can infer that the valence model of economic voting is multidimensional."," The fundamental expectation of the 'valence' model of economic voting is proposed by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011).

" The current valence interpretation of economic voting suggests that voters are primarily concerned with the incumbent party's economic record over the past year or so when making their choice at the ballot box. Valence models of political choice assert that voters take into account the incumbent's relative performance and reputation when deciding which party to vote for. More recently, an increasing number of studies have shed light on another dimension of economic voting, which is related to political parties' image of competence in managing the economy. This perspective has been explored by researchers such as Sanders, Bellucci, Butt, Smith, Martinsson, B¨¦langer, and G¨¦lineau."," The valence interpretation of economic voting suggests that when citizens cast their ballot, they are primarily concerned with the incumbent party's economic performance in the recent past.

" During times of financial crisis, the incumbent political party may not have any advantage due to the state of the economy. As a result, they may try to campaign on issues that are not related to the economy or emphasize the economy but present it in a more positive light. This can help the incumbent party project a more favorable image of themselves compared to their opponents, as noted by Nadeau et al (2010) and Vavreck (2009). The economic competence of a party can become a crucial part of their campaign message during such a time."," If a financial crisis occurs and the state of the economy doesn't provide any advantage to the incumbent party, they may choose to focus on a different campaign issue altogether or reframe the economy in a more favorable way to create a positive image, as suggested by Nadeau et al (2010) and Vavreck (2009). Therefore, the economic competence of a political party can be a crucial component of their election campaign message."," During an economic crisis, incumbent political parties may not have an advantage due to the state of the economy.

" The economy's valence dimension has two parts, one of which is retrospective. This aspect is different from the traditional dimension as it has a comparative approach. While the typical dimension only considers the current party's economic record, the competence dimension evaluates their economic performance in comparison to other economies. The voter's question is whether the country's economy is performing better than comparable economies when facing difficulties. If it does, then the incumbent party is still viewed positively, despite the crisis context and the impact on the national economy. This process of comparison is called benchmarking by Kayser and Peress (2012), and Duch and Stevenson (2010) refer to it as voters extracting information about the government's relative economic competence."," The economy's valence dimension is composed of two parts, one of which is retrospective. However, it distinguishes itself from the traditional dimension in one crucial way. The usual aspect only takes into account the incumbent party's economic record, while the competence dimension has a comparative approach. This involves evaluating the economic performance of the incumbent party in light of other economies. The voter's question becomes whether the country's economy performs better than comparable economies, even during difficult times. If the answer is yes, then the incumbent party is well-regarded, even in the midst of a crisis context and its effects on the national economy. Kayser and Peress (2012) called this cognitive process ""benchmarking,"" while Duch and Stevenson (2010) conceptualize it as voters extracting cues about the government's relative economic competence."," The economy's valence dimension is comprised of two aspects, with the second one being retrospective.

It assesses the economic performance of the incumbent party in comparison to other economies. The key question for the voter becomes whether the nation's economy, despite challenging situations, is performing better than comparable economies. If the answer is affirmative, the voter concludes that the incumbent party has performed well despite the crisis context and its impact on the national economy.

" Issue ownership has a competence-based component that depends on how well political parties handle particular issues. It can be evaluated through performance comparison and benchmarking, especially in the context of the economy. However, this aspect must not be mistaken with the ""associative"" component of issue ownership that stems from a party's attention history to specific issues via policy priorities, which has less to do with performance itself. This distinction between the valence and policy dimensions of issue ownership parallels the previous section's discussion between the conventional economic voting hypothesis and Kiewiet's policy-oriented view of economic voting. For more information on this critical distinction, check out Walgrave et al's 2012 research."," The competence-based part of issue ownership pertains to how well political parties can handle particular issues. It can be assessed via comparison and benchmarking, particularly in economic matters. This element is separate from the ""associative"" side of issue ownership, which concerns a party's history of attention to specific issues through their policies. This component is less involved with performance per se. It's worth noting that this distinction between the valence and policy dimensions of issue ownership is comparable to the conventional economic voting hypothesis versus Kiewiet's policy-oriented perspective of economic voting discussed in the previous section. If you want to learn more about this critical distinction, read Walgrave et al's 2012 study."," Issue ownership includes a competence-based component that depends on how well political parties manage specific issues.

" We contend, following Martinsson (2009, p. 230), that issue ownership plays a significant role in accounting for why incumbents may not be penalized for poor economic performance. Although other studies have attempted to explain this phenomenon, they have tended to zero in on/contextual factors (as summarized in Anderson, 2007) rather than examining how parties' perception of economic management influences economic voting. Issue ownership represents another critical element in this regard."," We share the view of Martinsson (2009, p. 230) that issue ownership is a crucial factor that contributes to why incumbents are not held accountable for objectively poor economic performances. Despite numerous studies that have aimed to explain this trend, many have concentrated on institutional and contextual aspects (as reviewed in Anderson, 2007), rather than the parties' image as competent economic managers. We believe that issue ownership is an additional influential component that is integral to understanding economic voting."," Along with Martinsson (2009, p. 230), we contend that issue ownership is an important factor that contributes to why incumbents are not penalized for poor economic performance, as opposed to what objective measures indicate. Although several studies have attempted to elucidate this phenomenon, many have focused on different institutional and contextual aspects instead of examining the parties' perception as competent economic managers (as outlined in Anderson, 2007). We believe that issue ownership is a critical piece of the puzzle necessary to comprehend economic voting."
" Our study aims to explore how perceptions of competence in managing the economy influenced incumbent voting during the 2008 and 2011 Canadian federal elections. According to our hypothesis, if voters saw the incumbent party as the most competent at managing the economy, they would be more likely to vote for the Conservative Party, while perceiving an opposition party as the most competent would decrease support. Previous research conducted by B¨¦langer and G¨¦lineau in the 2008 Quebec election and Martinsson's study on six Swedish national elections primarily focused on the specific issue of unemployment. In contrast, our research examines the concept of competence in the economy more broadly defined, for two consecutive Canadian national elections."," The 2008 and 2011 Canadian federal elections were potentially influenced by voters' perceptions of political parties' competence in managing the economy. Our study explores this possibility and suggests that voters who viewed the incumbent party as the most competent in economic management are more likely to support the Conservative Party while voters who believed that the opposition parties were more competent would not support them. Previous studies by B¨¦langer and G¨¦lineau on the 2008 Quebec election and Martinsson's research on six Swedish national elections examined similar effects but focused on specific issues, such as unemployment. In contrast, our study examines the general concept of economic competence over two consecutive Canadian national elections."," The Canadian federal elections of 2008 and 2011 might have been influenced by voters' perception of the political parties' competence in handling economic affairs. Our research delves deeper into this possibility and argues that voters are more likely to support the Conservative Party if they view the incumbent party as competent in economic management, while they are less likely to support a party in opposition if they are perceived as less competent. B¨¦langer and G¨¦lineau, in their study of the 2008 Quebec election, and Martinsson in their research on six Swedish national elections, both looked at similar effects but focused on specific issues, such as unemployment. Our investigation, on the other hand, studies the broader scope of economic competence over two consecutive Canadian national elections."
" We have employed two indicators to measure the sociotropic economic assessments retrospectively. Initially, the classic measure based on a regular question is utilized which asks if the Canadian economy is in a better, worse, or same state as last year (better = +1, same = 0, worse = ?1). This measure is expected to captivate the traditional economic voting effect. However, when investigating the economic voting in the 2008 Canadian election, Gidengil et al (2012, p. 77) found the effect of this measure was weak. They contend that voters did not hold the Conservative government responsible for the economic downturn as the financial crisis originated primarily in the United States (Gidengil et al, 2012, pp. 79¨C82). Therefore, we have proposed a second measure of retrospective economic evaluations, which considers responsibility attribution. This measure weighs the original economic perception variable based on whether respondents attribute the responsibility for favorable or unfavorable economic conditions to the government's policies."," Two measures have been utilized to gauge retrospective sociotropic economic assessments. The first measure comprises the traditional question of whether the Canadian economy has gotten better, worse, or stayed the same over the past year (better = +1, same = 0, worse = ?1). This measure is expected to capture the conventional economic voting effect. However, Gidengil et al (2012, p. 77) have reported a weak effect of this measure in their study on economic voting in the 2008 Canadian election. They argue that many voters did not hold the Conservative government responsible for the economic downturn as the financial crisis primarily erupted in the United States (Gidengil et al, 2012, pp. 79¨C82). Therefore, we have developed a second measure of retrospective economic evaluations that accounts for responsibility attribution. This economic responsibility measure weighs the original economic perceptions variable based on whether the respondents attribute their good or bad national economic conditions to the government's policies."," To measure retrospective sociotropic economic assessments, we have used two indicators. The first is the classic measure, based on the usual question of whether Canada's economy has improved, worsened or remained about the same over the last year (better = +1, same = 0, worse = ?1). This measure is expected to capture the traditional economic voting effect. However, Gidengil et al's (2012, p. 77) investigation of economic voting in the 2008 Canadian election resulted in a weak effect of this measure.

Therefore, we have constructed a second measure of retrospective economic evaluations that factors in responsibility attribution. This measure, known as an economic responsibility measure, weighs the original variable of economic perceptions according to whether the respondent attributes the responsibility for the good or bad national economic conditions to the government's policies."
" The measure of political parties' economic management competency in the study is based on responses to the question ""Which political party do you think can best handle the economy?"". The competency variable was coded as +1 for the Conservative Party, -1 for another party, and 0 if the respondents did not name any party as competent, if all parties are considered competent, or if they are unsure. The study employed a split-sample experiment where the question was only asked to half of the sample in the 2008 survey. The other half was asked about job creation, as this issue is relevant to the economic crisis context. The researchers included the aspect of job creation in their analysis as an additional evidence of economic voting through competency assessments. This coding methodology was similar to studies by B¨¦langer and Meguid (2008); B¨¦langer and G¨¦lineau (2011)."," In the study, the researchers used responses to the question ""Which party do you believe would be best equipped to handle the economy?"" to measure people's perceptions of political parties' competency as economic managers.

The question was asked only to half of the sample in the 2008 survey, while the other half was asked a related question about job creation. Given that job creation is relevant to the economic crisis context, the study used job creation as another indicator of economic voting through people's competency assessments.

" The 2008 Canadian federal election was scheduled by Prime Minister Stephen Harper just before the economic crisis erupted in the US housing and financial markets. Canadian citizens went for voting on October 14th while acknowledging the economic turmoil happening worldwide and being aware of the Canadian economy's slowdown and the likelihood of collapse in the coming months. According to the CES survey data, 81% of non-Quebec respondents considered the economy a crucial issue in the election, while another 17% thought it was a relatively important topic. It was apparent that the economic downturn had affected the opinion of people about the state of Canada's economy. 46% of respondents thought that the economy had worsened in the past year, 39% deemed it had remained the same, and just 14% felt that the situation had gotten better. According to the traditional economic voting hypothesis, these negative economic views should have negatively impacted the incumbent Conservatives."," Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced the 2008 Canadian federal election right before the economic crisis in the American housing and financial markets unfolded. With the Canadian economy already beginning to slow down and on the verge of collapsing, people who went to the polls on October 14th had in mind the crisis context. According to the CES data, around 81% of respondents outside Quebec considered the economy as a critical issue in that election, while an additional 17% said it was somewhat important. The start of the economic downturn led to a negative outlook among people toward Canada's economy. About 46% of respondents believed that the economy had deteriorated over the past year, with less than 14% saying that it had improved.

" In the regression model presented in Column 2 of Table 1, the traditional 3-point measure of past economic assessments is replaced by the 5-point economic responsibility measure. Both indicators have been standardized to run from ?1 to +1. According to the results, economic voting is just as significant as in the first model when using the economic responsibility indicator, which is consistent with Gidengil et al's (2012) intuition about economic voting in the 2008 Canadian election. An incumbent government cannot be fully responsible for a country's declining economic conditions during a global economic crisis. Only voters who blame the government's policies, and not the government itself, are expected to vote against it, which is what the economic responsibility indicator attempts to capture. In the 2008 Canadian election, economic voting occurred and negatively impacted the incumbent party since most Canadian voters believed that economic conditions had worsened or at least had not improved. However, the economic voting was strongest among a smaller group of people who attributed credit or blame to the government's policies, with everything else being equal."," The regression model in Column 2 of Table 1 replaces the traditional 3-point measure of past economic assessments with the 5-point economic responsibility measure, though both indicators are standardized to range from ?1 to +1. The outcomes indicate that economic voting is just as significant as in the first model when utilizing the economic responsibility indicator, which coincides with Gidengil et al's (2012) ideas regarding economic voting in the context of the 2008 Canadian election. In the midst of a global economic crisis, a governing party can't be wholly responsible for a country's declining economic conditions. Only voters who attribute the blame to the government's policies, and not the government itself, are anticipated to vote against it, which is what the economic responsibility indicator aims to catch. Economic voting occurred in the 2008 Canadian election, and it negatively affected the incumbent party since a majority of Canadian voters believed that economic conditions had deteriorated or failed to improve. However, such voting was strongest among a smaller group of individuals who linked credit or blame to the government's policies, assuming all else to be equal."," The 5-point economic responsibility measure replaces the traditional 3-point measure of past economic assessments in Column 2 of Table 1's regression model. Besides, both indicators get standardized to range from ?1 to +1. The outcome confirms that economic voting is still considerable with the use of the economic responsibility indicator. This is in line with Gidengil et al.'s (2012) thoughts on economic voting within the 2008 Canadian election context. An incumbent government cannot incur full responsibility for a country's deteriorating economic conditions during a global economic crisis. It would help if you held only voters responsible who blame the government's policies and not the administration per se if they choose to vote against it. This is what the economic responsibility indicator endeavours to capture.  In 2008, economic voting did happen, which negatively impacted the incumbent party since most Canadian voters thought that economic conditions had declined, or at least had not improved. Yet, the voting occurred the most strongly when a relatively smaller group interpreted the government's policies' credit or blame, with everything else being equal."
" The minute difference between the two models in Table 1 indicates that responsibility attributions have a relatively insignificant impact on the traditional economic voting effect. The addition of responsibility attributions does offer a crucial aspect to the effect but doesn't substantially enhance the model's explanatory power. As previously mentioned in the article, relying solely on retrospective economic perceptions to understand economic voting is insufficient, particularly during financial crises. Accordingly, the hypothesis suggests that party competence at managing the economy during bad times can either counteract economic perceptions or reinforce them."," Although the two models in Table 1 have a very small difference in terms of model fit, the contribution of responsibility attributions to the traditional economic voting effect is not very significant. While responsibility attributions do add nuance to the effect, they do not significantly increase the model's explanatory power. From the beginning of the article, the authors suggest that relying solely on retrospective economic perceptions is not enough to fully explain economic voting, especially during times of financial crisis. As predicted, perceptions of party competence in managing the economy can either reinforce or counteract economic perceptions during hard times."," Despite the slight difference in model fit between the two models in Table 1, it seems that responsibility attributions have a modest impact on the traditional economic voting effect. Responsibility attributions provide some crucial perspective on the effect, but they do not substantially improve the model's explanatory power. As noted early on in the article, relying on retrospective economic perceptions only offers an incomplete understanding of economic voting, especially in financial crises. As hypothesized, perceptions of a political party's competencies in terms of economic management during difficult times may have either a mitigating effect or a strengthening effect on economic viewpoints."
" The researchers examine the influence of the two valence dimensions of economic voting on the likelihood of supporting the incumbent party, while controlling for other factors.

" The standard approach of neoclassical economics does not include the concepts of economic emergence and entrepreneurship, which we believe should not be ignored.

" Conventional neoclassical economics is built on the belief that people make rational decisions based on the principle of constrained optimization. This theory has been expanded to account for strategic interactions, but much of macroeconomics still employs it in the context of a single ""representative agent."" While this rule provides analytical precision, it only works in cases where there is certainty or quantifiable risk, which are simplistic contexts. When there is uncertainty, such as a lack of knowledge about events or their probabilities, the rule is insufficient. In these cases, economic behavior continues to occur via creative and cooperative processes that can result in the emergence of new network structures with unique attributes."," Neoclassical economics is based on the assumption that economic decision-making follows a logic that is constrained by optimization rules. This principle has increasingly been seen in the context of strategic interactions over the past 30 years. However, macroeconomics mostly relies on the assumption of a single ""representative agent."" Although this rule is precise for calculating data, it only applies to simplistic situations where there is certainty or quantifiable risks. It fails when it comes to predicting economic decision-making under uncertainty, where there is no knowledge of events or the probabilities involved. Despite this, economic behavior continues to emerge, producing creative and cooperative responses, and network structures that are irreducible to their underlying elements."," Neoclassical economics centers on the idea that economic decision-making is driven by constrained optimization using cold logic. While this rule has gained popularity in the context of strategic interactions, macroeconomics still relies on the assumption of a single ""representative agent."" It is essential to recognize that this rule's precision can only work in situations of certainty or quantifiable risk, which are simplistic. Economic decision-making under uncertainty, where the events or their probabilities are unknown, cannot be predicted by following the optimization rule. However, economic behavior is observed to occur through creative and cooperative processes, giving rise to economic emergence and new network structures with unique characteristics."
" Evolutionary economics is a school of thought that directly deals with economic emergence. The field is primarily focused on how economic systems transform from within. Since evolutionary theory is based on the concept of change, it includes a set of behavioural rules adopted and applied by economic decision-makers. For instance, Nelson and Winter (1982) emphasized the importance of behavioural routines in this regard. This is because economic agents have to operate in historical time, which comes with a lot of uncertainties. In evolutionary economics, economic agents are considered to be reducing the uncertainty they face by pursuing bundles of rules that lead to economic goals. Economic emergence happens when new bundles of radical rules produce technological capital goods, productive networks, institutional contracting systems, and procedural skills. This evolutionary process is facilitated through self-organization, sharpened further by competitive selection, where various technologies, organizational structures, institutions, and procedures become dominant."," Economic emergence is a subject that has been addressed most directly by evolutionary economics. This area of study is concerned with understanding how economic systems undergo transformations from within.

" Understanding economic emergence requires an understanding of the genetic and culturally learned drivers of human behavior, as well as their interaction with the energy requirements of living systems. To analyze economic behavior, institutions and how they change alongside changing circumstances must also be considered. Traditional economic analysis shouldn't be disregarded, but instead, the limits of calculative behavior should be recognized. Evolutionary theories prioritize diversity of behavior over uniformity, as every individual has their different ways of responding to information. Therefore, the question of whether behavior is optimal according to logical criteria comes second to comprehending the scope of personal responses to available information."," To gain an understanding of economic emergence, it's essential to understand both the genetic and cultural drivers of human behavior and how these interplay with the energy requirements of living systems. To evaluate economic behavior, we need to understand the different institutional rules that humans adopt in their various cultures and how these change over time. We don't need to reject typical economic analyses because humans try to make the best decisions they can, given their circumstances. The primary issue isn't optimization, but rather the limitations of our ability to calculate optimal choices combined with the many diverse ways individuals respond to available information. In all evolutionary theories, the focus is on the diversity of behavior rather than conformity to a set norm. Therefore, the question isn't whether a specific behavior is optimal but more about understanding the range of ways individuals can respond to information."," The comprehension of economic emergence necessitates an understanding of both the genetic and culturally acquired drivers of human behavior and their interactions with the energy requirements of dissipative systems.

" In the 1950s, the field of economics began to move towards a logical framework that did not allow for emergence. This meant that important drivers of economic growth were ignored in favor of a ""force field"" representation of a fully connected network system borrowed from physics in the 19th century. At the time, it did not appear that this economic approach would become dominant. Critics of neoclassical economics - such as the Keynesian Revolution - had already raised questions about its ability to accurately represent economic behavior. While non-neoclassical models of medium-term business cycles and economic growth, such as the Harrod-Domar model, gained popularity in macroeconomics, neoclassical economics remained dominant in microeconomics."," In the 1950s, economics shifted towards a logical framework that couldn't account for emergent phenomena.

Critics of neoclassical economics, like the Keynesian Revolution, had already questioned its efficacy in representing economic behavior. Although macroeconomics at the time leaned towards non-neoclassical models like the medium-term multiplier-accelerator representation of the business cycle, neoclassical economics remained the core of microeconomics. Harrod's theory of economic growth became the standard, with the Harrod-Domar model as the favored approach in planning for economic development."," During the 1950s, the field of economics adopted a logical framework that was inconsistent with emergent phenomena.

At the time, it was not expected that this type of economic analysis would become mainstream.

" Neoclassical economists believed that a better understanding of the microfoundations of macroeconomics was the key to dealing with technological change in growth models. This perspective gained popularity after the neoclassical synthesis interpretation of Keynesian economics, first promoted by John Hicks, was widely accepted following Keynes' death. Consequently, neoclassical economists had an easy time advancing into business cycle and growth theory, despite the complexity and lack of empirical evidence in the mathematical models that had emerged. To address this, neoclassical economists relied on the simplification of representative optimizing agents, which were easy to understand and apply, provided that they made strong assumptions. However, these models failed to account for economic emergence, as they did not consider the role of entrepreneurs, differentiated firms, or the Marshallian flux, as discussed by Metcalfe in 2007."," To tackle technological change in their growth models, neoclassical economists believed that improving the microfoundations of macroeconomics was necessary. This viewpoint emerged after the Keynesian model's neoclassical synthesis interpretation gained popularity following Keynes' death. As a result, neoclassical economists found it relatively easy to advance into business cycle and growth theory in the subsequent decades, despite the complex and often-ambiguous mathematical models they encountered. Neoclassical economists attempted to bypass these challenges by developing simple, representative optimizing agent foundations. These foundations were easy to understand and apply, provided that they made specific simplifying assumptions. However, they failed to consider economic emergence, such as the role of entrepreneurs, differentiated firms, and the Marshallian flux, characterizing economic activity, as pointed out by Metcalfe in 2007."," Neoclassical economists posited that the key to addressing technological changes in growth models was to improve the microfoundations of macroeconomics. This perspective gained credence following the neoclassical synthesis interpretation of Keynesian economics propagated by John Hicks, which became widely embraced after Keynes' death. This made it relatively easy for neoclassical economists to advance into business cycle and growth theory over the next few decades, despite the mathematical models being untidy, complex, oftentimes without equilibrium solutions, and difficult to verify empirically. Neoclassical economists decided to circumvent these complexities by resorting to simple analytical foundations featuring a representative optimizing agent. These foundations were easy to understand but relied on strong simplifying assumptions to be applicable. Unfortunately, these theories failed to account for economic emergence, as they did not take Schumpeter's entrepreneur, the Marshallian flux, or the differentiated firm into account, according to Metcalfe (2007)."
" The field of economics focused on constrained optimization and scientific recognition in the latter half of the 20th century, leading to the replacement of intellectual stalwarts Marshall, Veblen, and Schumpeter by Samuelson, Arrow, and Debreu. This shift came at a cost, disconnecting economics from economic emergence and limiting the importance placed on behavioral traits beyond conventional neoclassical rationality. The aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis revealed the shortcomings of this approach. Keynes had foresightedly argued for considering the impact of animal spirits or waves of optimism and pessimism that influence business investment and ultimately contribute to economic fluctuations. However, neoclassical synthesis overlooked this concept, and the Keynesian explanation became simplified to a story of labor market failure in an otherwise well-functioning (non-)neoclassical world."," The economic field underwent a significant transformation in the latter half of the 20th century, putting emphasis on constrained optimization and scientific identity, and leading to the intellectual displacement of Marshall, Veblen, and Schumpeter by Samuelson, Arrow, and Debreu. However, this approach neglected the significance of economic emergence and the importance of behavioral traits that exceeded the boundaries of narrow neoclassical rationality. The myopic focus on conventional ideas of rationality partly contributed to the failure of economists to predict the 2008 global financial crisis. Keynes had earlier recognized the role of 'animal spirits' in driving business investment and causing fluctuations in economic growth, but the neoclassical synthesis overlooked this concept, instead depicting the Keynesian explanation as labor market failure in an otherwise well-functioning non-neoclassical world."," In the latter half of the 20th century, the economics discipline underwent a fundamental shift towards constrained optimization and scientific credibility. The intellectual torchbearers in the field changed from Veblen, Marshall, and Schumpeter to Samuelson, Arrow, and Debreu. However, this move came at a cost, cutting economics off from economic emergence and neglecting the significance of behavioral traits that did not conform to traditional neoclassical rationality. This failure of neoclassical economics came to light following the 2008 financial crisis with economists unable to foresee the impending danger. Decades earlier, Keynes had argued that business investments were influenced by 'animal spirits,' resulting in waves of optimism and pessimism responsible for economic fluctuations. But the neoclassical synthesis ignored this idea, instead simplifying the Keynesian explanation as a case of labor market failure amidst an otherwise successful non-neoclassical world."
" Endogenous growth theorists in the 1990s proposed that Solow's unexplained residual could be clarified by introducing ""knowledge"" as a production factor with unique qualities that result in economies of scale or externalities. This approach relies on neoclassical principles and involves generating a ""stock"" of knowledge through research and development, incentivizing scientists to discover inventions that may be transformed into new capital equipment sold to consumer goods producers. Despite its explanatory intentions, the equilibrium endogenous growth theory fails to explain the process of economic emergence, and it overlooks entrepreneurship as the main driving force behind economic growth. As usual, the theory's assumptions and functional types must be cleverly crafted to make the theory work; nonetheless, it only explains evident observations such as the significance of investing in education, encouraging innovation, and the benefits of socially useful patents while discouraging excessive protection."," In the early 1990s, endogenous growth theorists posited that Solow's unexplained residual could be accounted for by introducing ""knowledge"" as an extra production factor with unique attributes that give rise to economies of scale or externalities.

However, the equilibrium endogenous growth theory falls short of explaining the process of economic emergence despite its explanatory intent and pays little attention to entrepreneurship as the primary catalyst for economic growth. As always, it requires clever assumptions and functional structures to work, but it merely confirms what we already know: investing in education and training is critical, promoting innovation is essential, and patents are helpful but should not be overly protective."," By the early 1990s, the advocates of endogenous growth theory had proposed that Solow's inexplicable residual could be clarified by supplementing ""knowledge"" as an extra production factor with distinct features that bring forth economies of scale or externalities.

However, the equilibrium endogenous growth theory fails to clarify the process of economic emergence, despite its attempts to be explanatory, and largely overlooks entrepreneurship as the primary driving force behind economic growth. As usual, the theory's assumptions and functional forms must be carefully selected to make it work effectively, but it only confirms what we already know: investing in education and training is crucial, promoting innovation is necessary, and patents have social benefits, but excessive protection is undesirable."
" The representation of emergent processes such as competition and innovation through mathematical models only captures ""weak"" emergence and fails to completely account for ""strong"" emergence, which describes more radical innovations and entrepreneurial activities. Emergent processes and the economic growth paths they follow have a deterministic component, as they operate within dissipative structures that need to remain structurally coherent over extended periods of time. This structural coherence can be estimated mathematically through econometrics, but it still does not fully capture the evolutionary process that involves structural change. As such, statistical residuals within a logistic diffusion model that has been estimated econometrically contain both the non-deterministic components of an emergence process, in addition to normal Gaussian stochasticity."," Mathematical models are capable of representing emergent processes like competition and innovation, but they can only capture their ""weak"" emergence, not the more radical ""strong"" emergence seen in Schumpeterian innovation and associated entrepreneurship. Because economic systems are dissipative structures, they must remain structurally coherent and have a deterministic component for economic growth to occur. This persistence has a mathematical structure that can be estimated with econometrics but still provides an incomplete representation of an evolution process that involves structural change. Therefore, statistical residuals in a logistic diffusion model estimated with econometrics contain all of the non-deterministic components of an emergence process, in addition to normal Gaussian stochasticity."," While mathematical models can represent emergent processes, such as competition and innovation, they only capture ""weak"" emergence and not the more extreme ""strong"" emergence involved in Schumpeterian radical innovation and entrepreneurial endeavors.

" Evolutionary economics has effectively dealt with weak emergence in both its theory and application, suggesting that it is an adept field. It is also recognized that strong emergence serves as the origin of economic growth and development. Although Joseph Schumpeter's work established the creation of novelty through entrepreneurship as the critical catalyst for economic emergence, evolutionary economists face analytical difficulties in dealing with it. Therefore, this area necessitates further research to produce a thorough analysis of economic emergence."," Evolutionary economists have demonstrated skill in addressing weak emergence both in their theories and in empirical applications, indicating a high level of competence in the field. It is also acknowledged that economic evolution and growth are sourced from strong emergence, and the significance of this phenomenon is well understood. Although the pioneering work of Joseph Schumpeter established that entrepreneurship plays a pivotal role in generating novelty and promoting economic emergence, evolutionary economists continue to experience analytical challenges in dealing with the concept. Therefore, further research and development are needed to achieve a comprehensive understanding of economic emergence."," The work of evolutionary economists has proven successful in tackling weak emergence in both its theoretical and empirical aspects, demonstrating a high level of proficiency in this particular field. Moreover, it has been widely accepted that strong emergence is the crucial source of economic evolution and growth, and this concept is well understood. Although Joseph Schumpeter's seminal work has established that entrepreneurship is the catalyst for economic emergence, it remains analytically difficult for evolutionary economists to handle. Thus, this aspect of evolutionary economics requires further investigation and advancement before a comprehensive understanding of economic emergence can be reached."
" The concept of emergence states that a whole is greater than the sum of its parts, an idea that has been acknowledged in mainstream economics. In evolutionary economics and business strategy, the analysis of this phenomenon is focused on the operation of entrepreneurship. Venturesome individuals or teams establish connections between various components such as machines, individuals who have skills, and utilize organizational rules and energy sources successfully. Evolutionary economists have contributed to the field by conducting case studies or implementing agent-based simulations to expand their knowledge on this topic.

" Companies can become locked in a historical pattern of operating because of their successful physical, cultural, conceptual, and organizational structure. This lock-in can limit a firm's ability to adapt and presents an evolutionary dilemma. Tighter connections increase efficiency but make adaptation more challenging, while looser specialized connections are less efficient but offer more flexibility. There is more adaptive potential in industries and economies as a whole than in individual firms, making an overly rational neoclassical approach a disadvantage. This is exemplified by the case of IBM, which had to create a separate branch to innovate and create personal computers, as their highly efficient model made it challenging to adapt. Complexity theory also highlights the importance of suboptimal behavior in individual components, recognizing that optimizing a system as a whole may require trade-offs."," When a company has built a successful physical, cultural, conceptual, and organizational structure, it can become stuck in this pattern, known as a historical lock-in, which places limits on its ability to adapt. This creates an evolutionary dilemma - tighter specialized connections can create more efficient networks, but also make it harder to adjust when needed. Looser groups of unspecialized individuals may be more flexible, but less productive. There is typically more room for adaptation within an industry rather than any individual firm, causing an overemphasis on rational neoclassical approaches to be a disadvantage. IBM is a standard example of a highly efficient organization which struggled to adapt to changing market conditions, despite its organizational excellence.

" The Indian economy has undergone changes in its policy structure as it has taken steps to open up the economy further while reducing government control. This study tests the hypothesis that the level of economic growth in India, which is a federal system with different business regulations, taxation, and government spending across states, is positively impacted by greater economic freedom. Using a pooled linear regression model to analyze categorical data, this study measures economic freedom and its three components as independent variables and income per capita growth rates and gross state domestic product growth as the dependent variable for 20 states in three time periods- 2004/2005, 2006/2007, and 2009/2010. This study also incorporates income per capita, literacy rate, sectoral composition, and inflation rate to control the impact of other factors.

" Market-oriented policies have long been acknowledged as a means of driving economic development (Berggren 2003). The building of market institutions and widespread market liberalization are key components of the Washington Consensus (World Bank 2002), which aims to reduce excessive government intervention in economies through adjustment programs, such as those implemented by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Market-based institutions are essential in effectively transmitting information, supporting property rights and agreements, and enforcing competition in such a way that they influence economic development (De Vanssay and Spindler 1994; Alesina 1998; De Haan and Siermann 1998; Nelson and Singh 1998) - this is supported by the World Bank (2002). These institutions are designed to foster economic freedom by providing incentives for growth, such as low taxation, a legally independent system and the safeguarding of private property (Murphy et al. 1991; Gwartney 2009).

" There has been a traditional belief in the economic world that freedom from coercion can lead to growth and affluence. From Adam Smith's time until now, many economists have reasoned that economic freedom, as described by Hayek, plays a crucial role in promoting growth. This belief is backed up by strong evidence that shows a positive statistical correlation between economic freedom and growth. Since competition is vital in free economies, they tend to experience faster growth than less free ones. Furthermore, competition leads to increased economic growth, particularly in liberal economies, which report a higher number of entrepreneurial discoveries and private investments. While economic freedom is an essential indicator, the effects of its individual components vary across different economies. Many studies have been carried out to determine its diverse impacts on the economy's overall health."," Economic freedom, defined as ""absence of coercion,"" has been a longstanding belief among economists since the days of Adam Smith. There is strong evidence supporting the positive correlation between economic freedom and growth, with competition being a key driver of the free market economies. As a result, it is expected that free-market economies would grow and prosper faster than those with less economic freedom. Liberal economies, in particular, are well-positioned to foster entrepreneurial discoveries and channel private investments to areas with higher returns. Although economic freedom is an essential indicator of a healthy economy, its individual components have varying effects on the economy's overall health. There have been numerous studies exploring the different impacts of economic freedom's components on the economy, such as Ayal and Karras in 1998, Heckelman and Stroup in 2000, and Berggren and Jordahl in 2006."," The concept of economic freedom has been a widely held belief among economists since the time of Adam Smith. Economic freedom, which refers to the absence of coercion, is thought to be a precursor to growth and affluence.

As economic freedom promotes competition, it is logical to expect free-market economies to grow faster than those with less freedom. Liberal economies, in particular, provide fertile ground for entrepreneurship and private investments, thereby directing resources to the most profitable areas. While economic freedom is an important indicator of an economy's health, each of its components affects it differently.

" It is widely agreed upon that secure property rights are essential for economic growth, as highlighted by Parente and Prescott (2000). This is because secure and transferable rights to assets and contracts generate investment, which helps in enhancing growth. The allocation of assets becomes more efficient through security of property rights, leading to further promotion of growth (World Bank 2002). By having a well-functioning legal structure to support property rights, it becomes a necessary complement institution to other components of economic freedom, as suggested by Rodrik (2000)."," The importance of property rights for economic growth has been widely acknowledged, as confirmed by Parente and Prescott (2000).

" Access to sound currency is an essential component of economic freedom as it stresses the importance of keeping inflation under control. The repercussions of high and erratic inflation can have a detrimental effect on economic growth. However, Akerlof et al. argue that a moderate level of inflation can assist in the setting of prices and wages. It provides a necessary lubricant to the economic adjustment of relative prices in times of market fluctuations. In cases of wage and price rigidity, moderate inflation adds real wage flexibility that leads to a reduction in the long run unemployment rate. Nevertheless, empirical evidence on the relationship between inflation and growth is not conclusive."," One aspect of economic freedom includes access to stable currency, which emphasizes the importance of keeping inflation in check. Experiencing high and unstable inflation can be harmful to economic growth. Nonetheless, according to Akerlof et al., a reasonable level of inflation can have a lubricating effect on price and wage settings, especially in times of significant market fluctuations. With downward nominal wage and price rigidity, inflation promotes real wage flexibility that reduces long-term unemployment rates. The relationship between inflation and growth is somewhat ambiguous based on empirical evidence."," Another crucial component of economic freedom is the availability of stable currency, which highlights the significance of controlling inflation. The negative impact of high and fluctuating inflation on economic growth is well-documented. However, moderate inflation can grease the wheels of price and wage setting process, particularly when there are rigidities in the labor market. In such situations, it allows for greater flexibility in real wages and reduces the long-term rate of unemployment. Nonetheless, the exact relationship between inflation and growth is not entirely clear and remains somewhat controversial with mixed empirical evidence."
" The freedom to trade internationally may suggest that there are efficiency gains to be had through trade liberalization. With free trade, domestic firms can benefit from increased productivity, especially if exchanges are based on comparative advantages and international competition is present. This connection to the global market can also result in the spread of technological advancements. Despite continued debate about the relationship between trade liberalization and economic growth, some studies offer evidence supporting a positive correlation (Greenaway et al., 2002), while others are more hesitant to draw conclusions (Yanikkaya, 2003). Sachs and Warner (1995), as well as Rodriguez and Rodrik (2001), remain divided on the issue."," The freedom to engage in international trade could suggest that there are benefits of efficiency resulting from trade liberalization.

" Regulating labor, credit, and business is deemed an essential element of economic freedom. Scholars agree that fewer regulations commonly produce positive results in terms of growth (Calmfors and Driffill 1988; Baumol et al. 2007).

" Greater economic freedom is associated with higher levels of economic growth due to the productivity effect. The variables in the freedom index frequently lead to price distortions, which can impact how resources are allocated and efficiency. Consequently, economic freedom is likely to have positive impacts on economic growth, as observed by Cole in 2005."," A direct correlation exists between elevated levels of economic freedom and increased rates of economic growth. This link is likely attributed to the ""productivity effect,"" which arises as a result of many freedom index variables measuring price distortion and influencing resource allocation efficiency. Therefore, economic freedom is expected to have a positive impact on economic growth, Cole (2005) suggests."," The higher the degree of economic freedom, the higher the rate of economic growth, as evidenced by research. This relationship can be explained by the ""productivity effect,"" which arises from the fact that many of the freedom index variables measure price distortions that hinder the efficiency of resource allocation. As such, economic freedom is likely to have a favorable impact on economic growth, according to Cole's (2005) findings."
" It can be proposed that the promotion of a smaller government, the strengthening of legal provisions, and the assurance of secure property rights, along with greater adaptability and state involvement in credit, labour market, and businesses, could lead to a higher rate of economic growth in India. According to the neoclassical growth models of Solow-Swan and Ramsey, a greater value given to the rule of law indicator would cause an increase in the level of output per effective worker at a steady-state level. Conversely, a higher proportion of government consumption to GDP, which results in lower levels of output per effective worker at a steady-state level, would lead to a reduction in the growth rate. In conclusion, the growth rate is propelled in the former scenario while it is slowed down in the latter (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004)."," It is possible to postulate that India's economic growth could be enhanced by implementing a smaller government, improved legal measures, and guaranteed property rights, along with increased state intervention and adaptability in the credit, labour market, and business sectors. Solow-Swan and Ramsey's neoclassical growth models reveal that a higher value assigned to the rule of law indicator elevates the output per effective worker at a steady-state level, while a greater proportion of government consumption to GDP leads to a decrease in the output per effective worker at a steady-state level, causing a decline in the growth rate. Hence, growth rates are stimulated in the former scenario and lowered in the latter (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004)."," To boost India's economic growth, it could be suggested that the government should minimize its size, improve legal provisions, and secure property rights while increasing flexibility and state intervention in credit, labour market, and business. According to Solow-Swan and Ramsey's neoclassical growth models, a higher value of the rule of law indicator can increase the output per effective worker at a steady-state level. On the other hand, a higher ratio of government consumption to GDP can lower the output per effective worker at a steady-state level, reducing the growth rate. As a result, a higher growth rate can be attained through the former approach, whereas the latter method can lead to a slowdown in growth for a given set of values (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004)."
" According to Debroy et al. (2011), when the government interferes with the economy by having a larger role in producing and providing goods and services, or redistributing resources, it reduces the level of economic freedom. The increase in government expenditure can lead to distortions in private decision-making, which can affect the government's activities and lead to adverse effects of associated public finance, as explained by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004). The role of government in a free economy, in terms of economic freedom, should only provide protective and productive functions. When government expenditures exceed these basic functions and involve transferring resources between taxpayers, it is seen as limiting economic freedom, which was pointed out by Compton et al. (2011). Therefore, a small government is essential for raising economic freedom, while a large government size reflects more resource reallocation and intrusion into the private market that may hinder freedom. The non-linear relationship between government size and economic freedom was accounted for in creating the freedom index."," When the government interferes in the economy or has a larger role as a producer, a provider, or a redistributor of resources in order to reduce the level of economic freedom, it is revealed that this can lead to distortions in private decisions, as Debroy et al. (2011) explained. The increase in the size of the government and its spending could have serious negative impacts on both governmental activities and public finances, as detailed by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004). The freedom index aims to capture the idea that the government should only provide protective and productive functions in a free economy. Any government expenditures beyond these basic functions, and the transferring of resources between taxpayers, are regarded as the curtailment of economic freedom, as emphasized by Compton et al. (2011). Ultimately, a small government size is necessary for increasing economic freedom, while a large size of government connotes more intervention in the private market, indicating a decline in freedom. In creating the freedom index, the non-linear relationship between government size and economic freedom was taken into account."," As per the studies by Debroy et al. (2011), any interference by the government in the economy or its enhanced role as a producer, provider, or redistributor of resources, can reduce the degree of economic freedom. The rise in government size and its expenses is likely to lead to disfiguring private decisions, which may ultimately affect both governmental activities and public finance, as stated by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004). The freedom index for economic freedom seeks to convey the notion that a government's role in a free economy should only consist of protective and productive functions. Therefore, any government spending beyond the basic functions and transferring of resources between taxpayers is deemed as impinging on economic freedom, as stated by Compton et al. (2011). For this reason, a small size of government is essential to raising economic freedom, whereas a large size indicates more intrusion into the private market and more resource reallocation, possibly impacting economic freedom adversely. The non-linear relationship between government size and economic freedom is appropriately considered in constructing the freedom index."
" Undertaking any business venture's success hinges heavily on the flexibility of labor markets. An entrepreneur's capacity to adopt necessary adjustments to expand their enterprise is greatly beneficial (Altman, 2007). Similarly, entrepreneurs profit significantly from the freedom to optimize their workforce and exit markets. However, infrastructural and raw material constraints can be a detriment to entrepreneurs and may lead to their failure (Debroy et al., 2011)."," The adaptability of labor markets is a crucial factor that contributes to the success of any business venture. Entrepreneurs' ability to steer their organizations towards necessary change to grow is fundamental (Altman, 2007). Permitting entrepreneurs to optimize their workforce and leave markets are strategic advantages. On the other hand, entrepreneurs may face limitations regarding infrastructure and raw materials that can hinder their growth and lead to their failure (Debroy et al., 2011)."," Ensuring a flexible labor market is vital for the successful operation of any business. It is a significant indication of an entrepreneur's ability to embrace necessary changes that foster enterprise growth (Altman, 2007). Granting entrepreneurs the freedom to optimize their labor base and exit markets can enhance their business capabilities significantly. However, entrepreneurs' success may depend on the availability of infrastructure and raw materials, and constraints in these areas could hinder the growth of their enterprise, leading to failure (Debroy et al., 2011)."
" The money market's volatility can lead to uncertainties, and these uncertainties are often indicated by inflation which can also reflect macroeconomic instability. Various views on the impact of inflation on output growth have contradictory claims. Inflation can lead to either the ""grease effect"" (Tobin 1972) or the ""sand effect"" (Friedman 1977). The grease effect suggests that inflation can help adjust to long-run equilibrium faster, while the sand effect speculates the possibility of misallocation of resources that can cause a deceleration in growth. Studies reveal that developed countries tend to exhibit a predominant grease effect, while developing countries show a significant sand effect. One debate is that high inflation rates can cause inefficient allocation of resources, distorting price signals and leading to a decrease in real net return on investment. Consequently, there will be a decline in investment and economic growth in the long run. Conversely, some believe that inflation may have favorable impacts as money can act as a capital substitute. Despite conflicting views, the empirical impact of inflation on economic growth remains uncertain."," The instability in the money market can create uncertainties, which are often characterized by inflation, indicating macroeconomic instability as well. The role of inflation in output growth has conflicting opinions, with the ""grease effect"" (Tobin 1972) and the ""sand effect"" (Friedman 1977) producing opposing effects. While the grease effect suggests that inflation helps the adjustment to long-run equilibrium, the sand effect raises concerns about possible resource misallocation, slowing down growth. As per empirical literature on developed countries, the grease effect takes precedence, whereas the sand effect gains significance in developing countries (Loboguerrero and Panizza 2003). The high inflation rates cause inefficiencies in resource allocation, resulting in a decrease of real net returns on investment and thereby lead to a decline in investment and economic growth in the long run. However, some argue that money can serve as a substitute for capital, making inflation to have favorable effects as well (Tobin 1980). Consequently, the impact of inflation on economic growth remains an empirical question."," Volatility in the money market may lead to uncertainties, and one of the indicators of such volatility is inflation, which also reflects macroeconomic instability. There are clashing views on the role of inflation in output growth as inflation can have both positive and negative effects. The ""grease effect"" (Tobin 1972) suggests that inflation can speed up the adjustment to long-run equilibrium, while the ""sand effect"" (Friedman 1977) speculates on the potential for resource misallocation resulting in deceleration in growth. In developed countries, the grease effect seems to play a more significant role in spurring growth, while in developing countries, the sand effect becomes more significant (Loboguerrero and Panizza 2003). High inflation rates can distort price signals and relative prices due to inefficient allocation of resources (Akerlof et al. 1996), leading to a decrease in the real net return on investment. As a result, investment and economic growth are likely to decline in the long run. On the other hand, money can act as a substitute for capital, leading to the possible favorable impact of inflation on economic growth (Tobin 1980). The impact of inflation on economic growth remains an empirical question with no clear consensus."
" The composition of an economy's sectors is a significant factor in its growth trend. The industry mix, which is reflected in the sectoral composition, provides insights into this aspect. Favorable structural changes that lean towards fast-growing sectors boost growth and the income earned per capita. Although previous studies looked into the role of services in compositional effects, the Indian economy emphasizes the manufacturing industry as much as the fast-rising service sector, which is an employment-generating sector. Understanding compositional effects relies on two independent factors: the shares of employment for the secondary and tertiary sectors. However, the influence of such factors is unclear, and their expected signs depend on each sector's relative size and the dynamics of employment across all the economy's sectors. Therefore, the impact of industry and services shares on India's growth rates remains an empirical inquiry."," The structure of an economy plays an important role in its economic growth. The sectoral composition, which reflects the industry mix, can be used as a useful indicator in this regard. A shift towards fast-growing sectors can bring about improvements in growth and per capita income. Earlier studies have examined the role of services in compositional effects, but in the Indian economy, the manufacturing sector, as well as the fast-growing service sector, are both crucial employment-generating sectors. To understand the compositional effects, the shares of employment for the secondary and tertiary sectors are analyzed as two independent factors. However, the expected sign of each variable is not clear and depends on the relative size of each sector and the employment dynamics prevailing in all other sectors. Therefore, the impact of the shares of industry and services on growth in India remains an empirical question."," Understanding an economy's structure is crucial in relation to its economic growth. An indication of the industry mix, the sectoral composition is useful for this purpose. Changes in favor of fast-growing sectors can lead to growth and per capita income improvements.

" Investing in human capital is essential for economic growth. The level of human capital is a crucial factor in determining a country's growth rates. Researchers suggest that increasing investment in human capital can lead to higher growth rates until the economy reaches a steady state. Human capital can help alleviate the issues associated with diminishing returns to physical capital, and as a result, yield long-term per capita growth. Thus, the production of human capital can be an alternative mechanism to generate growth instead of relying on technological progress. The availability of human capital can also help reduce the costs associated with adopting sophisticated techniques and technologies in a country, which can lead to higher returns. In addition, the balance between human and physical capital affects the growth rate, with an abundance of human relative to physical capital leading to faster growth rates. Conversely, if human capital is relatively scarce, growth rates will fall. Overall, investing in human capital is a crucial factor in promoting economic growth."," One of the significant contributing factors to economic growth is the level of human capital. Increasing investment in human capital leads to higher growth rates until the economy reaches a steady state. Human capital's presence can relax the limiting constraints associated with diminishing returns to physical capital resulting in long-term per capita growth in the absence of exogenous technological progress. This means that the creation of human capital can substitute for technological progress, consequently generating long-term growth. Depending on the balance of human and physical capital, the growth rates can either increase or decrease. For instance, an economy with abundant human capital relative to physical capital tends to have higher growth rates, while a scarcity of human capital relative to physical capital leads to slower growth rates. In situations where physical capital or human capital destruction occurs, the economy can recover much faster if physical, rather than human capital is destroyed. In addition, a country with more human capital availability can adopt sophisticated techniques and technologies at a lower cost and achieve higher returns."," The amount of human capital invested in a country is a significant determinant of economic growth. Studies have shown that an increase in human capital investment leads to higher growth rates until the economy approaches a steady state. The presence of human capital can reduce the constraints associated with diminishing returns to physical capital, leading to long-term per capita growth rates without the need for technological progress. This means that investing in human capital can serve as an alternative to improving technology to stimulate growth. The balance between human and physical capital also plays a critical role in shaping growth rates. A country with abundant human capital relative to physical capital will tend to have higher growth rates, while a country with more physical capital than human capital will experience slower growth rates. In crises, the destruction of physical capital causes less severe economic harm than the destruction of human capital, and therefore, it is easier for the economy to recover from the destruction of physical capital. With greater availability of human capital, the cost of adopting new techniques and technologies is reduced, leading to higher returns."
" The implementation of various liberalization measures in India dates back to 1991, consisting of two phases: the first and the second generation reforms. The academic circles use these terms to differentiate between the external and internal liberalization initiatives. The first generation reforms concentrated on the external sector, introduced by the central government, concerning product markets. On the other hand, the second generation reforms aimed at the domestic economy and emphasized issues that primarily fall under the purview of the state government, especially the markets for land and labor. These pertinent policies are discussed in works by Debroy et al. (2011) and Jha (2009)."," India introduced a series of liberalization measures, primarily external and internal, commencing in 1991. Scholars refer to these measures as first and second generation reforms, categorized by the focus of the reforms. First-generation reforms were initiated by the central government, with specific emphasis on the external sector and product markets. The latter came under the purview of the central government. Second-generation reforms that took place later mainly focused on domestic economic reforms, with particular attention to issues that come under the jurisdiction of state governments, such as markets for land and labor.

" Notably, there have been significant enhancements in the economic freedom scores due to the implemented reforms with the values rising from 5.1 in 1990 to 6.4 in 2008 (Table 1). The individual indicators of economic freedom, except for 'access to sound money,' have persistently shown improvements over the years.

" India is a vast country with significant variations among its states, potentially attributed to their different social, political, and institutional structures. As a result, the national situation may not accurately represent the states' situations. Furthermore, economic reform plans have not had an equal impact on all of the country's states. While some states have been more enthusiastic about adopting reform initiatives, others have remained trepidatious. As a result, some states have a greater degree of economic freedom, and some have seen more significant growth than others. As a result, the examination of economic freedom and growth patterns should concentrate on these inter-state differences."," India, being an enormous country, displays clear discrepancies among its component states, probably due to variations in their socio-political and institutional setups. Consequently, the national scenario may not accurately depict the conditions of the respective states. Additionally, the impact of economic reforms has not been uniform across all regions of the country. While some states have shown more willingness to embrace the reform agendas, others have lagged behind consistently. As a result, certain states enjoy greater economic freedom than others, and some have experienced more rapid growth rates. Hence, assessing economic freedom and growth patterns necessitates examining these inter-state variations."," India, being a vast nation, consists of distinctly diverse states with possible distinctions arising due to socio-political and institutional variations.

 The study is concerned with economic freedom and its indices as significant variables to be investigated. The first column of Table 2 demonstrates the outcomes concerning the influence of overall economic freedom on economic growth.

" According to the data presented in Table 2, columns 2, 3, and 4 illustrate the economic freedom indices for three different components. With regards to the economic freedom index for the size of government, it appears that a lower level of government intervention leads to higher levels of economic freedom and subsequently greater economic growth. The coefficient for this index is significant and positive, indicating that states with smaller government spending, a smaller government enterprise sector, and lower marginal tax rates tend to achieve greater economic growth. Additionally, the coefficients for legal structure and security of property rights are both positive and significant, suggesting that ensuring the rule of law and protecting property rights are vital aspects of governance that positively influence economic growth. The regulation of labor and business also plays a critical role in economic growth, with this area of economic freedom reflecting the impact of state intervention in labor markets, bureaucratic and procedural costs, as well as physical infrastructure. Therefore, it can be said that high flexibility in labor markets contributes to increased output growth.

" The share of employment in India's tertiary sector has a direct impact on the country's per capita income growth. However, the secondary sector's share of employment does not seem to have any significant relevance. The objective of incorporating the tertiary and secondary sectors in the growth model is to analyze the net compositional effects resulting from the shift of people from low-productive agriculture jobs to higher productive opportunities emerging from the secondary and tertiary sectors. India's growth story is currently attributing a large part of its success to the expanding tertiary sector, which is observing a continuous rise in its share in the country's GDP. The surge in the tertiary sector's growth and employment is largely driven by information and communication technology, revealing that the dominant contribution of ICT in promoting India's growth."," The proportion of employment in India's tertiary sector plays a vital role in determining the country's per capita income growth.

" The importance of measuring literacy rates as an indication of human capital is noteworthy when it comes to the role it plays in influencing economic growth. The positive correlation between initial literacy rate coefficients and economic growth suggests that states with stronger human capital foundations at the outset tend to have higher growth levels. This indicates that the existence of human capital faculties can complement physical capital, allowing for a delay in the onset of diminishing returns to reproducible capital, as identified by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991)."," When it comes to determining economic growth, the literacy rate, which serves as a proxy for human capital, plays a crucial role. The positive value of the initial literacy rate coefficient indicates that states with higher human capital levels at the beginning tend to experience more substantial growth. As such, human capital can complement physical capital, thereby delaying the onset of diminishing returns to reproducible capital, according to Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991). This suggests that human capital, together with physical capital, can contribute to sustainable economic growth."," The literacy rate, often used as an indicator of human capital, is a vital determinant of economic growth. From the positive coefficient of the initial literacy rate, it is evident that the states with greater human capital resources tend to experience higher growth rates.

Hence, human capital is capable of contributing to long-term economic growth along with physical capital."
" The per capita income growth rate of the Indian states is linked to their initial levels of per capita income. Interestingly, states that have high per capita incomes initially grow faster than their counterparts with low per capita incomes, supporting the findings of Rao et al. (1999). This discovery opposes the prediction of the neoclassical growth theory, which assumes that there are diminishing returns to reproducible capital, as explained by Solow in 1956.

" It is evident from the results that economic freedom has a positive impact on the economic growth of India. What is noteworthy is that all three dimensions of economic freedom play a significant role in the Indian states. Therefore, it is sensible for the nation and its constituent states to reduce the size of the government and minimize the government's involvement in the market's free operation. The need for flexible regulations in credit, labor, and product markets is also indispensable. Strengthening the legal structure would enhance the business-friendly environment throughout the Indian states, thus leading to economic growth."," The data demonstrates that economic freedom promotes economic growth in India. What is striking is that all aspects of economic freedom are significant to the Indian states. As such, it is judicious for the country and its regions to downsize the government and limit its meddling in the market's free mechanism. Additionally, flexible regulations concerning credit, labor, and product markets are equally crucial. Strengthening the legal framework would establish a more hospitable environment for businesses across India's states, encouraging growth."," The findings indicate that economic freedom plays a key role in driving economic growth in India.

Also, having flexible regulations governing the credit, labor, and product markets are indispensable. Strengthening the legal structure would create a more conducive business environment across India's states, leading to economic progress."
"  Economic growth can be affected by both economic freedom and culture, as described in this paper. Culture, as measured by the World Values Surveys, and economic institutions related to economic freedom are both vital for economic prosperity, though their impact can only be fully understood when both are considered in the growth regression. Results from the research indicate that economic freedom has a more substantial influence on growth outcomes than culture, implying a certain level of substitutability between these two factors. In the absence of economic freedom, culture plays a more significant role in growth, while its significance decreases as economic freedom is established."," This paper explores the influence of economic culture and freedom on economic growth. According to the World Values Surveys measuring culture and economic institutions grounded on economic freedom, both factors independently impact economic prosperity. However, only when both are included in the growth regression can their strength of impact be better understood. Research results show that economic freedom is more critical than culture for growth outcomes, indicating a certain degree of substitution between the two. The study argues that culture is essential for growth when economic freedom is absent, reducing in relevance when economic freedom is established."," The relationship between economic freedom, culture, and economic prosperity is discussed in this paper.

The results indicate that economic freedom has a more substantial impact on growth outcomes than culture, implying that culture and economic freedom can complement or substitute each other. Furthermore, the research suggests that culture's importance diminishes as economic freedom is established, whereas culture plays a more significant role in growth in the absence of economic freedom."
" In order to facilitate economic growth and development, it is essential to establish fundamental economic institutions, such as private property, rule of law, and contract enforcement. According to North's (1990) definition, institutions refer to the ""rules of the game,"" including formal structures and informal norms, that incentivize behaviors. Formal institutions are written rules, while informal institutions are the cultures, norms, and conventions outlined by social custom. Although economists acknowledge the significance of both formal and informal institutions on growth and development, it is still unknown which has greater impact. As a result, we contend that economic institutions and culture must both be taken into account when examining economic growth."," To stimulate economic growth and development, it is crucial to institute economic institutions, such as private property, the rule of law, and contract enforcement.

The emphasis of the analysis is on the complementary or substitutive nature of economic freedom and culture, with the primary focus being on the relative impact of each factor on economic prosperity. This investigation dissects how economic freedom and culture interact, but it primarily provides insight into how their individual effects on the economy are significant."
" The study employed a fixed effects model from 1970 to 2004 and conducted multiple robustness checks. The findings indicate that economic prosperity is influenced by both culture and economic freedom. However, when culture and economic freedom are taken into account simultaneously, the association between culture and economic growth becomes less strong, while the impact of economic freedom on growth is overwhelmingly positive and highly significant. This implies that culture and economic freedom can operate as substitutes, with culture fulfilling core institutional functions like protecting property rights and enforcing contracts when economic freedom is absent. However, economic freedom institutions become credible, reducing the need for informal culture mechanisms."," The research utilized a fixed effects model spanning from 1970 to 2004 while incorporating numerous robustness checks. The study discovered that economic prosperity is impacted by both culture and economic freedom. Nevertheless, when analyzing both culture and economic freedom together, the relationship between culture and economic growth weakens, whereas the influence of economic freedom on growth remains positive and extremely significant. Thus, culture and economic freedom may function as replacements, in which culture offers essential institutional functions such as defending property rights and enforcing agreements in the absence of economic freedom. However, when economic freedom institutions are trustworthy, the informal mechanisms of culture become less necessary."," The study employed a fixed effects model covering the period from 1970 to 2004 and incorporated multiple robustness checks. The results revealed that both culture and economic freedom independently contribute to economic prosperity. Nevertheless, when both culture and economic freedom are taken into account simultaneously, the association between culture and economic growth weakens, while economic freedom continues to have a strong and statistically significant positive relationship with economic growth. This indicates that culture and economic freedom may serve as substitutes, where culture provides crucial institutional functions like safeguarding property rights and enforcing contracts in the absence of economic freedom. However, when credible economic freedom institutions are in place, there is less need for relying on the informal mechanisms of culture."
" The connection between economic freedom and growth is thoroughly examined in the literature, as mentioned above. The theoretical basis for this correlation is also well-established. According to De Haan and Sturm (2000: 3), the freedom to choose and supply resources, competition in business, trade with others, and secure property rights are essential ingredients for economic progress, and economists and economic historians have been promoting these factors since the time of Adam Smith, if not sooner."," As previously mentioned, previous literature has extensively examined the direct correlation between economic freedom and growth. The theoretical underpinnings supporting this relationship are also firmly established. De Haan and Sturm (2000: 3) assert that since the era of Adam Smith, if not before, economists and economic historians have been advocating for the importance of the freedom to choose and supply resources, competition in business, trade with others, and secure property rights as crucial aspects of economic development."," The literature has thoroughly scrutinized the robust relationship between economic freedom and growth, as mentioned earlier. The theoretical foundation for this connection is also well-established. As De Haan and Sturm (2000: 3) note, since the time of Adam Smith, if not earlier, economists and economic historians have argued that the freedom to select and provide resources, competition in business, trade with others, and secure property rights are key drivers of economic progress."
" To gain a greater insight into the potential impact of culture on economic development, we concentrate our attention on specific cultural concepts that are deemed pertinent to economic interaction and exchange. These cultural factors are known as 'economic culture' and are described by Porter (2000: 14) as ""the beliefs, attitudes, and values that have a bearing upon the economic activities of individuals, groups, and institutions."" By limiting our focus to these cultural indicators, we can provide a more detailed analysis of the link between culture and economic growth (Patterson 2000)."," In order to delve deeper into the relationship between culture and economic progress, we narrow our scope by focusing on specific cultural indicators that are relevant to economic interactions and exchanges. This subset is referred to as 'economic culture' and is defined by Porter (2000: 14) as ""the beliefs, attitudes, and values that pertain to the economic activities of individuals, organizations, and other institutions."" By employing this more targeted approach, we can provide a more comprehensive analysis of the ways in which culture affects economic growth (Patterson 2000)."," To better comprehend the potential influence of culture on economic advancement, we narrow our focus to several key cultural indicators that are germane to economic interaction and exchange. This subset is designated as 'economic culture' and is defined by Porter (2000: 14) as ""the beliefs, attitudes, and values that impact the economic activities of individuals, organizations, and other institutions."" By zooming in on these cultural factors, we can provide a more extensive examination of the link between culture and economic growth (Patterson 2000)."
" The variable associated with our economic culture is formulated based on the methodology introduced in Tabellini's works (2008a, 2009). The methodology identifies four distinct categories of culture, which are expected to influence behavior relating to social and economic interaction. The four components, namely trust, respect, individual self-expression, and obedience regulate the way people interact in markets and entrepreneurship. Trust, respect, and individual self-expression are expected to stimulate economic and social interaction, whereas obedience is considered a constraint on economic interaction that leads to lower levels of risk-taking, which is necessary for entrepreneurship."," Our assessment of economic culture is constructed using Tabellini's methodology (2008a, 2009) and involves identifying four separate categories of culture that are believed to influence individuals' behavior and impact economic growth and development. These categories, namely trust, respect, individual autonomy, and obedience, regulate the interactions between individuals involved in market production, entrepreneurship, and overall social and economic interactions. Trust, respect, and individual autonomy encourage economic and social interaction, while obedience is thought to limit economic interaction, as lower risk-taking inhibits entrepreneurship development."," Our economic culture variable is developed using the methodology outlined in Tabellini's publications (2008a, 2009) and is based on four culture-based components that shape behavior related to social and economic interactions, thus affecting economic growth and development. These four components, trust, respect, individual self-determination, and obedience, form the rules that govern interactions between individuals, including market production and entrepreneurship. Generally, trust, respect, and individual self-determination encourage social and economic activity, while obedience constrains it by limiting risk-taking, a necessary ingredient of entrepreneurship."
" Self-determination is a measure of the level of control an individual has over their lives and personal choices. If a person has a high level of self-determination, they see economic success or failure as a result of their own efforts. This motivates them to work harder to achieve greater productivity and increase their overall welfare. Banfield (1958) suggests that the more control an individual has over their lives, the higher the economic development of their country will be."," Self-determination is a quantitative measure of how much control an individual feels they have over their individual choices and their lives. When individuals attribute economic success or failure to their own efforts, they are deemed to have high levels of self-determination. With a high level of self-determination, individuals are more likely to work harder to increase their productivity and subsequently, their welfare. Banfield (1958) argues that the economic development of a country is closely associated with the level of control individuals have over their lives, as determined by their 'locus of control'."," The extent of control an individual feels they have over their lives and choices is measured by self-determination. Individuals with high levels of self-determination attribute economic success or failure to their own efforts, which motivates them to work harder and ultimately leads to an increase in their welfare. Banfield (1958) advocates that an individual's 'locus of control' plays a crucial role in the overall economic development of a country. The greater control individuals have over their lives, the greater the likelihood of economic success."
" Culture and economic freedom could be substitutes or complements, theoretically speaking. The reason for this is that both of them have an impact on economic growth independently. If both are included in the same regression and one overshadows the other, then they are considered substitutes. On the other hand, if both remain significant, it suggests that culture and economic freedom complement each other in contributing to economic growth."," The interrelation between culture and economic freedom can work in favor of substitutes or complements. This is because both of them have individual influences on economic growth. When both are considered in a single regression analysis, if one outperforms the other, then they are regarded as substitutes. Conversely, if both continue to have a significant impact, it implies that culture and economic freedom complement each other in strengthening economic growth."," The link between economic freedom and culture can either substitute or complement each other, depending on the scenario. Economic growth is affected by both economic freedom and culture separately. When both are analyzed together in the same regression, if one of them dominates the other, then they can be seen as substitutes. However, if both continue to have a significant influence, it suggests that economic freedom and culture work complementary to promote economic growth."
" An example of a culture that favors economic growth could opt to transform informal institutions into those linked with economic freedom. When the formal guidelines become credible, informal mechanisms such as trust networks, which were once relied upon for economic exchange, might lose their significance. As a result, economic freedom should take precedence over culture in the growth regression, indicating a substitution effect."," In order to foster economic growth, a culture may make a decision to formalize informal institutions and align them with economic freedom. When formal rules become reliable, the importance of informal norms and mechanisms, like trust networks used for economic interactions and exchanges, may decline significantly. If this occurs, the growth regression should show economic freedom surpassing culture and indicating a substitution effect."," To encourage economic growth, a culture may decide to formalize its informal institutions and associate them with economic freedom. As soon as these formal regulations become credible, the role of informal norms and systems, such as trust networks, that are used for economic interaction and exchange, may lose their significance. In this case, economic freedom becomes more dominant than culture in the growth regression, and a substitution effect can be observed."
" It is reasonable to believe that culture and economic freedom are complementary variables that can significantly contribute to economic growth. Although culture and economic freedom can separately catalyze the growth of an economy, the positive effects of both these variables combined are much stronger than individually. A trustworthy culture can instigate certain exchanges, but the presence of formal and informal institutions of freedom, that protect private property rights and prevent predation by government, is crucial in the sustained and large-scale economic growth. A number of studies have indicated that culture and economic freedom reinforce each other, further validating this notion. (citations excluded)"," There's a compelling argument to suggest that culture and economic freedom are two interdependent variables that significantly impact economic growth. While both culture and economic freedom can independently contribute to economic growth, the combined effect of formal and informal institutions of freedom and a trustworthy culture is far stronger and sustainable. For instance, while a trusting culture can initiate certain exchanges, the support of laws that protect private property rights and prevent predatory behavior by the government is key to long-term economic growth. This argument is supported by a number of studies that have demonstrated that culture and economic freedom strengthen and reinforce each other. (references omitted)"," It's reasonable to argue that culture and economic freedom are complementary to each other and both are significant variables when it comes to economic growth. Though each variable might independently contribute to economic growth, their collective impact is much stronger than individually. A culture based on trust can prompt a few exchanges, however, when paired with a government that enforces laws that protect private property rights and prevent predatory behavior, the result is sustained and large-scale economic growth. Studies suggest that culture and economic freedom enhance each other and their combined impact is important to consider. (references excluded)"
" In order to measure economic freedom, we make use of the Economic Freedom of the World Index which has been established and widely cited. The index, created by the Fraser Institute (Gwartney et al. 2008), assesses the level of economic freedom on a scale of zero to ten taking into account 42 different components. The higher the rating, the greater the level of freedom. These components are further classified into five broad groups which include the size of government, legal structure and security of private ownership, monetary policy and price stability, regulation of credit, labor, and business, and freedom to trade with foreigners.

" The investment share is one of our standard control variables because studies show a positive association between the rate of investment in physical capital and growth (Levine and Renelt 1992). However, economic freedom and investment rate inclusion in the same regression may raise potential endogeneity issues, as highlighted by De Haan et al. (2006). Research suggests that economic freedom directly enhances productivity and has an indirect impact on growth via investment (Dawson 1998; Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles 2003; Gwartney et al. 2004). Despite using investment in our primary specification, we plan to deal with the endogeneity concern in later sections."," Our standard control variables include the investment share, as the literature consistently shows a positive correlation between physical capital investment and growth (Levine and Renelt 1992). Nonetheless, we recognize the potential for endogeneity problems when economic freedom and the investment rate are both included in the same regression, as identified by De Haan et al. (2006). Multiple studies have established that economic freedom has both a direct effect on productivity and an indirect effect through investment on growth (Dawson 1998; Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles 2003; Gwartney et al. 2004). Although we include investment in our primary specification, we aim to address the endogeneity concern in later sections."," To account for the well-documented positive relationship between physical capital investment and growth (Levine and Renelt 1992), we consider the investment share as a standard control variable. However, we are mindful of the potential endogeneity issue when both economic freedom and investment rate are included in the same regression, as noted by De Haan et al. (2006). Economic freedom enhances growth through direct productivity improvement and indirect promotion of investment (Dawson 1998; Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles 2003; Gwartney et al. 2004). Although investment is included in our primary specification, we intend to address the endogeneity concern in later sections."
" When examining the relationship between culture and economic freedom, column three of the regressions is used to differentiate between the substitutability and complementarity of these variables. In the OLS regression, the significance of culture is not maintained when controlling for economic freedom. Nevertheless, culture remains significant at the 10% level in the fixed effects regression analysis. Economic freedom maintains its highly positive and significant relationship with growth across both specifications. Specifically, the fixed effects model in column three shows that a one standard deviation increase in culture and freedom leads to a growth increase of 0.65 percentage points and 1.93 percentage points, respectively. The joint significance of the F-statistics from columns one to three are highest when controlling for both culture and freedom, which suggests that controlling for both variables explains more of the variation in growth. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that economic freedom is the primary contributor to economic performance, whereas culture has a more modest impact on growth."," The third column of the regressions is used to explore the relationship between culture and economic freedom by differentiating between the substitutability and complementarity of the two variables.

Nonetheless, culture is found to be significant at the 10% level in the fixed effects regression analysis. Economic freedom has a strongly positive and significant impact on growth in both formulations. In the fixed effects model of column three, increasing culture and freedom by one standard deviation results in growth increases of 0.65 percentage points and 1.93 percentage points, respectively. Additionally, the joint significance of the F-statistics from all three columns is highest when controlling for both culture and freedom, indicating that we can explain more of the growth variability by incorporating both variables. These results lend support to the notion that economic freedom has a more substantial effect on economic performance than culture, although culture still has a positive impact on growth."," To differentiate between the substitutability and complementarity of culture and economic freedom in relation to growth, column three of the regressions was utilized. Results demonstrate that cultural significance disappears in the OLS regression when economic freedom is controlled.

In both specifications, economic freedom maintained its highly positive and significant relationship with growth. Specifically, in the fixed effects model presented in column three of the regressions, a one standard deviation increase in culture and freedom results in growth increases of 0.65 percentage points and 1.93 percentage points, respectively. Moreover, when controlling for both culture and freedom, the joint significance of the F-statistics in all three columns was highest, indicating that more of the variation in growth can be attributed to these variables. These results support the idea that economic freedom is primary in contributing to economic performance, although culture also has a positive, albeit milder, effect on growth."
" The results reveal that culture does not have a significant impact in all five regression specifications, but economic freedom exerts a positive and significant influence at a 99% level, providing additional evidence for the substitution theory. The findings suggest that a one-unit increase in the freedom index leads to a growth increase of 1.40 percentage points as indicated by regression (1). Remarkably, when controlling for educational attainment, the coefficient on freedom almost doubles and the R-squareds rise from an average of 0.28 to 0.93, suggesting a severe problem with endogeneity. Education is found to have a robust and significant positive association with growth, while other variables, excluding culture, are also statistically significant in this specification. Nevertheless, investment, population growth, and area show significance only in this specific regression. In contrast, urban population significance occurs in three out of four regressions but changes signs. Geography and legal origin have no significance."," The significance of culture was not found in any of the five regression specifications, although economic freedom had a positive and significant impact at a 99% level, providing further support for the substitution theory. Regression (1) revealed that a one unit increase in the freedom index led to a 1.40 percentage point increase in growth. Notably, when educational attainment was included in the regression, the coefficient on freedom almost doubled, and the R-squareds increased from an average of 0.28 to 0.93, indicating severe endogeneity. Education was positively and significantly associated with growth, while all other variables, except for culture, were also significant. This specific regression showed that only investment, population growth, and area were significant, while urban population was significant in three of the four regressions, despite a sign switch. Geography and legal origin were insignificant."," Across all five regression models, culture was observed to be insignificant, while economic freedom had a positive and significant effect at the 99% level, thereby bolstering the substitution theory.

However, when educational attainment was controlled for in the regression, the coefficient on freedom almost doubled, and the R-squared values increased from an average of 0.28 to 0.93, indicating the presence of severe endogeneity. The findings show that education had a strong, positive, and significant relationship with growth, and all variables, except culture, were significant in this particular specification. Significantly, investment, population growth, and area were significant in only this regression, while urban population was significant in three of four regressions, although there was a switch in signs. Geography and legal origin were both insignificant variables."
" Although the inclusion of the supplementary control variables doesn't offer significant explanatory power to the model, as shown by the nearly identical R-squareds to the baseline specification (excluding the education variable), we concede that our model simply accounts for about 25% of the variation in growth. We believe this is due to our careful approach in handling our control variables."," Despite the fact that the additional control variables don't contribute much to clarifying the model, as indicated by the similarity in R-squareds compared to the baseline specification (with the exception of education), we are aware that our model only explains about 25% of the growth variation. We attribute this to our cautious handling of the control variables."," Although the supplementary control variables don't add much explanatory power to the model, as hinted by the analogous R-squareds from the baseline specification (excluding education), we acknowledge that our model only accounts for roughly 25% of the variation in growth.

" Our benchmark and core analysis reveals that culture and economic freedom might act as substitutes. Our study demonstrates that economic institutions that promote private property rights, rule of law, and contracts enforcement are a crucial factor in economic growth. This result is consistent across various regression models.

" In order to directly test the possibility of reverse causality in our study, we conduct a simple check which involves analyzing both lagged and future values of changes in freedom, changes in culture, and our growth rate. We expect changes in income to cause subsequent changes in freedom and culture if reverse causality is driving our findings. Conversely, if freedom or culture is driving growth, we expect changes in these variables to be associated with growth in the following period. For this purpose only, we analyze changes in these variables instead of their levels."," To test for reverse causality more directly, we perform a simple check that involves evaluating lagged and forward-looking changes in freedom, changes in culture, and our growth rate. If our results are being influenced by reverse causality, we anticipate that alterations in income will subsequently lead to modifications in freedom and culture, or both. On the other hand, if freedom or culture is causing growth, we expect changes in these variables to be associated with growth in the succeeding period. Thus, we only examine changes in these variables and not their absolute levels for this particular analysis."," In order to address the possibility of reverse causality, we utilize a simple check that involves examining both past and future changes in freedom, changes in culture, and our growth rate.

" This article presents how the growing economic inequality since the mid-1970s has impacted the US economy and had a devastating effect on social work clientele. The main focus of social workers is social justice, and extreme economic inequality violates this idea. The article investigates how the interrelated changes in ideology, market economy, and governmental policies contributed to the economic crisis, which negatively impacted society. The political economy is compared between the post-World War II decades, which trended towards shared prosperity, and the period since the mid-1970s. The unequal economic and political conditions contributed to economic and political inequality affecting democracy, which ultimately led to the economic meltdown. The text points out the need for social reform and broadening the social movements that strive to achieve social justice, which would reduce the inequality. Additionally, the article elaborates on how social workers can contribute to and participate in social movements striving for equality."," The focus of the article is to emphasize that the economic inequality that has prevailed in the US since the mid-1970s is not just a violation of social justice but has also been dysfunctional for the US economy.

The article assessed the changes in ideology, market economy, and government policies, which are interrelated and impacted the economic crisis that negatively affected society. The contrast is made between the political economy of the mid-1970s and the post-World War II decades when the tendency was towards shared prosperity. The article examined how increased economic inequality and political consequences that undermined democracy led to the economic meltdown. The write-up also discusses the implications that the analysis has for social reform and for broadening the constituency of social movements pursuing social justice that aims to reduce economic and political inequality. It highlights the role social workers can play in contributing to solving such issues."," The main message conveyed in the article is that the economic inequality observed since the mid-1970s in the US is not only unjust to social workers, but it also has dysfunctional consequences for the economy.

The article looks at the changes in the ideology, market economy, and government policies that have happened since the mid-1970s and evaluates how it differed from the preceding post-World War II's shared prosperity era. The article also explored how this increase in economic inequality and undermined democracy, which culminated in the economic meltdown. The analysis suggests that the direction of social reform and social movements towards social justice should embrace widespread support as it would lower economic and political inequality. Lastly, the article relates how social workers can have a meaningful contribution towards reducing economic and political inequality through participation in social reform movements."
"The 65-year period following World War II can be separated into two parts from an economic inequality point of view. The first 30 years of this period saw a decline in inequality, while the following 30 years saw an increase in inequality, ultimately leading to an economic crisis. The article highlights the contrasts between the two periods in terms of income and wealth distribution, wages, unemployment, and poverty. It then goes on to explain the first period's political economy, where there was a connection between the democratic system of government and the capitalist economy. Although inequality remained a prevalent issue in the United States during this time, a new form of capitalism emerged, allowing more individuals to benefit from the growth in national income who were previously unable to do so. Additionally, there was a deliberate pursuit of full employment, which resulted in more people earning higher incomes. Despite being an abnormality in capitalism's history, this era arose due to the federal government's active role in the economy in response to exceptional conditions such as the Great Depression and World War II.","The 65 years that followed World War II can be divided into two distinct periods in terms of economic inequality. The first three decades saw a decrease in inequality, though it was always present, while the following 30 years experienced a surge in inequality, culminating in an economic crisis. The article provides a comparison between the two periods in regards to income and wealth distribution, wages, unemployment, and poverty. It then elaborates on the political economy of the first period, which shows how the democratic system of government was linked to the capitalist economy. Despite inequality remaining a pervasive issue in the U.S., the first period saw a new form of capitalism emerge, known as ""new capitalism,"" which allowed individuals who were previously unable to share in the prosperity of the economy to benefit from the rise in national income. Furthermore, there was a conscious effort towards full employment, which resulted in more people earning higher wages. In retrospect, this may have been an anomaly in capitalism's history that arose due to the federal government's relatively active role in the economy in response to major events such as the Great Depression and World War II.","Looking at economic inequality, the 65 years after World War II can be separated into two parts. The first 30 years showed a decline in inequality, while the subsequent 30 years saw a rise in inequality, ultimately leading to an economic crisis.

It then goes on to describe the first period's political economy, where a connection existed between the democratic system of government and the capitalist economy. During this time, a new form of capitalism emerged, known as ""new capitalism,"" which facilitated individuals who were previously unable to share in the economy's prosperity to benefit from the increase in national income. The policy of conscious pursuit of full employment, according to British economist Andrew Shonfield, created this situation and allowed more people to earn higher incomes. This period may have been an anomaly in capitalism's history, as the federal government in response to highly unusual circumstances such as the Great Depression and World War II played a more active role in the economy."
" Economic inequality has been on the rise for the past three decades, which is not a surprising trend. However, the extent of the wealth gap can still astound those who are aware of it. It is an obvious fact that inequality can be seen everywhere, from earnings and income to wealth, poverty, and lack of employment."," Over the last 30 years, the economic inequality has progressively increased, which is not a new phenomenon. Nonetheless, individuals who understand how serious this issue is may still be taken aback by the vastness of the gap. Inequality is pervasive and can be observed across various aspects such as wages, income, wealth, poverty, and joblessness."," The wealth divide has been escalating for the past 30 years, and its expansion is not surprising. Nevertheless, people who acknowledge this economic disparity may still be astonished by the magnitude of it. We can see extreme inequality all around us, whether it be in wages, income, wealth, poverty, or unemployment."
" The top 1 percent of households have experienced exceptional and imbalanced income gains. In 2007, the year before the financial crisis, the richest Americans had an average after-tax income of $1,319,700. This is an increase of $976,120 compared to the 1979 average, while the middle and bottom quintiles only saw increases of $11,200 and $2,400, respectively, in 2007 constant dollars. An analysis of the CBO data by Sherman and Stone of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities revealed that the disparity in after-tax income between the wealthiest 1 percent and the middle and poorest quintiles grew significantly, more than tripling between 1979 and 2007. The data suggests that income concentrations at the top are higher than at any moment since 1928, the previous disastrous financial crash."," The enormous and unequal income gains of the top 1 percent of households are especially egregious. According to a 2010 report from the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the average after-tax income for the wealthiest Americans in 2007, just before the financial collapse, was $1,319,700. This figure marks an increase of $976,120 compared to the 1979 average, whereas the middle and bottom quintiles only saw increases of $11,200 and $2,400, respectively, in 2007 constant dollars. After analyzing the CBO data, Sherman and Stone from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities explained that the income gaps between the wealthiest 1 percent, middle, and poorest fifth of Americans had more than tripled between 1979 and 2007. Based on this research and past studies, Sherman and Stone concluded that income concentration near the top of the income scale had reached its highest point since 1928, which was the year of the previous disastrous financial collapse."," The income gains of the wealthiest 1 percent of households are excessively disproportionate. In 2007, the year before the financial crisis, the average after-tax income for these Americans was $1,319,700, which is an increase of $976,120 over the 1979 average. In comparison, the middle and bottom quintiles only experienced increases of $11,200 and $2,400, respectively, in 2007 constant dollars. The report from the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 2010 confirmed these findings. Sherman and Stone of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analyzed the CBO data and found that the disparity in after-tax income between the top 1 percent and the middle and poorest fifth of Americans grew significantly, more than tripling between 1979 and 2007. As per the researchers, the data implies that the concentration of wealth at the top of the income scale is higher than it has been since 1928, the year of the prior disastrous financial crash."
" Wealth is distributed unevenly, and it is becoming increasingly concentrated in recent years. During the 1995 to 2004 period, despite aggregate household net wealth nearly doubling, the majority of the net gains went to the top quartile of income earners, according to Di (2007). In 2004, the top 10% of individuals owned 71% of private wealth, according to Wolff (2007). Edward Wolff's study entitled Top Heavy, details the emerging inequality of wealth in the country, noting that the title is fitting."," Over the years, wealth inequality has risen with the majority of wealth distribution going towards the top earners. Between 1995 and 2004, there was almost no gain in aggregate household net wealth for the rest of the population, as nearly all of the returns were given to the top quartile of income earners, as said by Di (2007). As of 2004, the richest 10% owned 71% of private wealth, as per Wolff's (2007) findings. Edward Wolff, who is an expert on the topic, wrote a study named ""Top Heavy,"" indicating the escalating wealth inequality in the United States."," Concentration of wealth has become a more pressing concern than income as it is skewed towards the affluent, an unrelenting trend that has been observed in the present era. Di (2007) reported that almost all of the net gains in aggregate household net wealth went to the top 25% of income earners from 1995-2004, despite the fact that there was a near-doubling of household net wealth. According to Wolff's (2007) calculations, the wealthiest ten percent of the population owned 71% of private wealth by 2004. Wolff (1995), a leading scholar in the area, wrote a study named ""Top Heavy,"" summarizing the escalating inequality of wealth in the United States."
" Unemployment during the period of shared prosperity was relatively lower than in the later decades, with an average of 4.8 percent from 1949 to 1973 as compared to an average of 6.5 percent from 1974 to 2008. High unemployment not only leads to lost income and inequality, but also a decline in the potential output for the economy. Additionally, it results in stagnating wages, as employers would not need to raise wages or offer attractive benefits and working conditions when there are more job-seekers than available jobs. In the 1990s, a slight dip in unemployment, although not at full employment, resulted in an increase in wages and benefits, especially for low-wage workers. This happened even though globalization was acting against this trend. The impact of unemployment is not limited to reduced income and tax revenues, but it also results in budget deficits for governments through increased outlays to care for unemployed workers."," Unemployment in the period of shared prosperity was not as high as it has been in recent times, with an average of around 4.8 percent compared to 6.5 percent in the years following. High unemployment can lead to inequality, lost income for workers, and decrease the potential output for the economy. It also results in stagnant wages since employers can hire people without raising salaries or offering enticing working conditions. Conversely, when the labor market is tight, it forces employers to increase wages and benefits, especially for low-wage workers who work hard but often get little in return. Although in the 1990s, unemployment was not at full employment, it was around 4 percent, and there were following increases in salaries and benefits. This happened even though globalization was acting against this trend. Increased rates of unemployment decrease income and tax revenues, which can also increase government spending to help support out-of-work individuals, thus contributing to budget deficits."," During the era of shared prosperity, unemployment rates were not as high as compared to later years, recording at approximately 4.8 percent from 1949 to 1973, whereas it recorded at 6.5 percent from 1974 to 2008. High unemployment can lead to inequality in society, a loss of potential output for the economy, and lost income for workers. In addition, such high unemployment results in stagnating wages because employers could opt to hire workers without raising wages or providing benefits or better working conditions when the number of job seekers is higher than available jobs. On the other hand, a tight labor market can stimulate employers to raise wages and provide better benefits, especially for low-wage workers. Even though unemployment was not at its lowest in the 1990s, hovering around 4 percent, benefits and wages increased. These increases happened despite the challenges of globalization. In summary, unemployment is not only a cause of reduced income and tax revenues but also contributes to government budget deficits through increased spending to support jobless workers."
" The federal government increased its control over the economy during the Great Depression and World War II to address those challenges. As a result, the size and activity of the government expanded from what it was before the Depression. The government's spending and taxing policies helped reduce the severity of recessions and distributed income more fairly. Social welfare measures, such as unemployment compensation, acted as economic stabilizers and reduced the contraction of consumer spending that would have otherwise worsened a downturn. The regulatory policies implemented by the New Deal aimed to prevent another financial speculation disaster like the stock market crash of 1929, and they continued into the post-war era. Higher tax rates that were introduced during World War II were maintained even in peacetime, and in exchange for this, real wages for laborers continued to rise, which helped maintain peace. Despite criticism that the system violated free-market economics, progressive economist Robert Kuttner argued that the system produced nearly three decades of egalitarian economic growth with an average annual growth rate of 3.8%."," In response to the serious challenges posed by the Great Depression and World War II, the federal government expanded its role in the economy.

"Businesses could have invested in productivity and innovation to eliminate their competitive disadvantage, as per Harrison & Bluestone (1985). However, companies chose alternative approaches that led to increased economic inequality. Strategies implemented included labor squeeze through wage freezes and flexible work patterns, globalization through the relocation of operations to low-wage countries, and the abandonment of production for paper profits resulting in job losses. General Electric and General Motors also shifted their focus to financial services to increase profits. These policies were encouraged by favorable foreign income tax policies and government funding of foreign manufacturing plants. Another policy was to lobby the government for lower taxes and fewer regulations.","Most businesses opted for alternative strategies that aggravated inequality rather than drive productivity and innovation to reduce their competitive disadvantage (Harrison & Bluestone, 1985). Instead, they pursued strategies such as labor squeezing, which involved wage freezes and flexible work arrangements that took away workers' job security. Another tactic was globalization, where businesses transferred operations to low-wage countries, resulting in job losses in the home country. Federal tax policies were instrumental in encouraging this trend by providing more favorable treatment to income earned abroad than on home soil. Businesses also abandoned production for paper profits, with General Electric selling off its consumer appliance division to concentrate on its more profitable credit corporation (Phillips, 2002). General Motors also streamlined its focus on financial services instead of auto production (Wolff, 2009).

" In the year 1980, the Republicans were able to successfully connect with the fiscally conservative, pro-business part of their voters along with some of the Democrats' New Deal coalition. The Democrats' policies regarding affirmative action, expanding welfare, school busing, women's liberation, gay rights, abortion, and high taxes were unsatisfactory for many former Democratic supporters, even including blue-collar workers.

" The belief that the political economies of capitalist countries are not uniform is supported by the contrasting views on agency and choice. Certain countries are not as wary of ""big government"" as others. Varied research shows that wealthy capitalist countries differ greatly in terms of poverty reduction and the extent of their welfare states. Although most welfare states have been reduced in recent years, relative poverty rates across nations show significant differences.

" Based on the analysis, it is evident that the key to recovery and improvement is to implement certain measures. Reregulation of the financial sector, reducing the control of the economic elite in politics, and promoting a more progressive labor movement are necessary to combat the issue of economic inequality. Additionally, policies must be put in place to enhance the well-being of lower- and middle-income populations.

By doing so, individuals can better address their needs without accruing debt beyond their means."," The prescription for addressing economic inequality can be inferred from the analysis. To mitigate this issue, the financial sector must be reregulated, the influence of economic elites in politics should be reduced, and a stronger labor movement must be fostered. Policies to combat inequality include expanding the range of social welfare benefits and elevating their level, guaranteeing living-wage jobs for all, and ensuring availability and affordability of healthcare, housing, childcare, and public transportation.

" The New Deal work programs devised and executed by social workers Harry Hopkins and Aubrey Williams were similar to the present-day job creation initiatives, but it is critical to improve the latter.

"Despite previous involvement in government job creation back in the 1930s, social workers have traditionally focused more on welfare than job creation. Nonetheless, given the social and economic effects of unemployment, including loss of income and social roles, social workers can make a difference in reducing inequality by supporting organizations that advocate for direct job creation by the government. In addition, they can support initiatives such as living wage campaigns, efforts to raise the minimum wage and Earned Income Tax Credit, and building a robust labor movement that advocates for the working class. Social workers joining unions can help to achieve these goals by advocating for reforms that benefit all workers, not just union members. Finally, supporting the Employee Free Choice Act 0f 2009 would help make it easier for workers to join unions while also reducing firing, harassment, and other anti-union practices.","In the 1930s, social workers played a significant role in government job creation, but the focus of the profession has since shifted to welfare instead of work. Unfortunately, even half of the current unemployment rate still leaves millions of people without jobs or with marginal employment opportunities. The social and economic effects of this issue include loss of income and social roles, which can exacerbate inequality. To help reduce inequality, social workers can advocate for direct job creation by the government and support living-wage campaigns, initiatives to raise the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit, and a stronger labor movement. By supporting the Employee Free Choice Act of 2009 (H.R. 1409), social workers can help make it easier for workers to join unions and to advocate for labor reforms that benefit all workers, not just union members. Joining a union is also an effective way for social workers to support labor movement goals and promote improvements for workers."," In the 1930s, some social workers played a prominent part in the government's job creation efforts. However, the profession nowadays focuses more on welfare than work.

Social workers can help reduce inequality by supporting organizations that advocate for direct job creation by the government. They can also support living wage campaigns and initiatives designed to raise the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit. Strengthening the labor movement would also go a long way towards this goal and elevate the voice of the working class. The Employee Free Choice Act of 2009 (H.R. 1409), which would make it easier for workers to join unions without fear of harassment or firing, is an essential step in the right direction. Social workers can also help advocate for reforms that benefit all workers, not just union members, by joining unions themselves."
" The elevated expense of meeting basic family requirements is an indication that several families, including social workers, who earn a higher income than the median are under considerable pressure and vulnerable to the dangers of predatory lending. It raises the question of who is responsible for protecting these families from becoming prey to such financial predators?

" The nation of Greece joined the Eurozone in 2001 and initially enjoyed a brief period of economic prosperity before encountering a significant financial crisis about nine years later. The economic landscape experienced a significant shift between the time of Greece's entry into the Eurozone and their reception of a collaborative bailout package from the IMF/EU. I employ this scenario to put the economic voting hypothesis to the test. Through the examination of longitudinal aggregate data dating from 1981 to 2009, I explore the association between certain macroeconomic factors and the vote percentage of the ruling political party, testing the ""grievance asymmetry"" concept. I also analyze individual-level data spanning from 2004 to 2009 to assess the degree to which retrospective sociotropic evaluations of the economy are linked to backing for the ruling party. The results suggest that sociotropic economic evaluations are closely linked to support for the party in power, but at times when the economy is in disarray, the ruling party has little opportunity for success and can only count on loyal followers for support."," Greece's inclusion into the Eurozone in 2001 spurred an initial phase of economic elation, which was followed shortly after by a significant financial disaster.

I utilize this circumstance as a means of assessing the economic voting hypothesis. Based on aggregate longitudinal data ranging from 1981 to 2009, I examine the association between macroeconomic indicators and the incumbent political party's vote share to determine if the ""grievance asymmetry"" theory holds any weight. Furthermore, with individual-level data spanning from 2004 through to 2009, I explore to what extent retrospective sociotropic evaluations concerning the state of the economy correlate with support for the party in power. The results show that sociotropic economic assessments are linked to backing for the ruling party, but during periods of economic turbulence, the incumbent party has very little chance of winning and should only rely on the support of die-hard loyal supporters."," Greece's entry into the Eurozone in 2001 resulted in a brief period of economic optimism prior to a significant financial crisis almost a decade later. From the time Greece became a part of the Eurozone until they accepted a joint IMF/EU bailout package, the economic condition that Greek voters were confronted with underwent a dramatic transformation.

Using longitudinal aggregate data spanning from 1981 to 2009, my investigation examines the connection between macroeconomic indicators and the incumbent party's vote share to verify the ""grievance asymmetry"" hypothesis. Additionally, by employing individual-level data that spans from 2004 to 2009, I investigate the degree to which sociotropic assessments of the state of the economy impact support for the ruling party. The findings indicate that evaluations of the economy's condition are linked to support for the government, but if the economy is at its worst, the incumbent party has little chance of winning and should only expect to receive support from their loyal fan base."
" The Greek economy faced its most challenging time in 2009, attracting global attention for the past two years. This was an unexpected development for many who had been impressed by the country's growth and success over the past decade. Greece became one of the first Eurozone countries, and economic activity soared as the Olympic Games drew closer in 2004, with unemployment rates decreasing. The conservative ND party's victory in the 2004 elections ended PASOK's 11-year regime and revealed signs of corruption in the government. Karamanlis, the conservative opposition leader, tackled corruption and promised reforms to the government."," In recent times, Greece has undergone its most challenging economic period which began in 2009.

" In 2009, Greece faced a serious crisis when its debt and budget deficit rose to alarming levels. Due to this, Prime Minister Karamanlis called for a snap election. The government of New Democracy (ND) faced difficulties in implementing reforms to handle the impact of the global recession, and several scandals resulted in the resignation of three ND ministers within a year (Gemenis, 2010). During the electoral campaign, Karamanlis refrained from making promises regarding the economic policy his party would pursue after the election. He also claimed credibility for being truthful regarding the actual economic situation of the country, which he attributed to the global financial crisis (Dinas, 2010). Despite his efforts, PASOK emerged victorious in the election with a comfortable majority (43.9% of votes and 160 out of 300 parliamentary seats), on the basis that the conservative government's poor management of the economy was responsible for its poor performance."," Greece experienced a challenging time in 2009 as its debt and budget deficit levels rose to alarming heights.

" Economic voting involves rational judgments by voters about the past performance of the economy. While prospective evaluations can be important, voters' perceptions and appraisals of policy and performance are key to their decision-making. According to Key, voters are not fools, and their evaluations can hold the government accountable. Fiorina expanded on this concept by suggesting that even uninformed voters can base their decisions on what life has been like during the incumbent's administration. Based on such evaluations, voters can elect or punish the government, making it relatively straightforward to either reward or replace the administration."," The concept of economic voting suggests that voters make rational judgments about the past performance of the economy, rather than being foolish in their decision-making.

" There is insufficient systematic analysis of economic voting behavior in Greece, and our understanding of this subject is primarily based on the study conducted by Freire and Costa Lobo in 2005. They analyzed the relationship between objective economic indicators and subjective perceptions of the economy relating to voting behavior in Greece, Portugal, and Spain from 1984 to 1999. According to their study, Greece showed a correlation between personal financial perceptions and GDP changes. Furthermore, the authors used Eurobarometer data to evaluate the role of the economy in party choice between 1985 and 2000 and found that ideology was the most significant aspect. While the importance of economic evaluations in relation to party preference has not been empirically tested for recent elections, economic voting at the aggregate level will be examined before exploring individual-level data."," Due to a lack of systematic analysis of economic voting in Greece, our present knowledge on this subject comes primarily from a comparative study by Freire and Costa Lobo (2005) and a case study analysis by the same authors.

" The incumbent party's support is related to macroeconomic performance via the reward-punishment hypothesis. This concept proposes that voters assess a government's economic indicators, such as inflation and unemployment, and then reward or penalize the party in power based on their performance in maintaining these metrics at desirable levels. Essentially, economic policy-making falls to the accountability of the government. Furthermore, opposing political parties can expect to gain support if voters are dissatisfied with the incumbent party's performance. Sanders discussed this concept in 2000, while Lewis-Beck in 1988 and Powell and Whitten in 1993 previously mentioned it."," The reward-punishment hypothesis explains the correlation between macroeconomic performance and the incumbent party's support. According to this theory, major economic indicators, such as inflation and unemployment, are evaluated by voters, who then reward or punish the current party based on its success in keeping these indicators at desirable levels. In other words, governments are held accountable for their economic policy-making decisions. Furthermore, underperforming incumbent parties can expect opposing parties to gain voter support. Sanders discussed this concept in 2000, while Lewis-Beck in 1988 and Powell and Whitten in 1993 previously mentioned it."," The reward-punishment hypothesis is the main argument that connects macroeconomic performance to the incumbent party's support. This hypothesis suggests that voters assess a government's performance on major economic indicators, such as inflation or unemployment, and then reward or punish the incumbent party based on their ability to maintain these indicators at desirable levels. Simply put, governments are responsible for their economic policymaking decisions. Additionally, opposing political parties can gain voter support when voters consider the incumbent party's performance insufficient. This concept was discussed by Sanders in 2000 and was previously described by Lewis-Beck in 1988 and Powell and Whitten in 1993."
" The theory of Mueller about voters solely reacting to economic circumstances if there is a drastic downturn is supported by research data from Germany and the United Kingdom (as cited in Nannestad and Paldam, 1997, p.85). However, can this proposition be extended to the level of individual voter analysis? Prior attempts to verify the ""grievance hypothesis"" at an individual level (referencing Kiewiet, 1983 and Lewis-Beck, 1988) were not successful, except for when studying the Danish electorate (Nannestad and Paldam, 1997). Conversely, van der Bruget al.'s cross-national evaluation of economic voting discovered proof supporting the ""grievance asymmetry"" hypothesis, which contends that economic voting is dependent on the direction of economic change. Instead of anticipating the coefficients on improving economic conditions to hover around zero (Lewis-Beck, 1988, p.78), the authors reported significant differences in the impact's magnitude between improving and deteriorating economic conditions (van der Brug et al., 2007, pp.142-159)."," Research data from Germany and the United Kingdom confirms Mueller's belief that voters only respond to economic circumstances in the event of a drastic downturn (referencing Nannestad and Paldam, 1997, p.85). But does this principle also apply to analyzing individual voters? Prior attempts to validate the ""grievance hypothesis"" at the individual level (as cited in Kiewiet, 1983 and Lewis-Beck, 1988) were fruitless, except for one notable example involving the Danish electorate (Nannestad and Paldam, 1997). Conversely, van der Brug et al.'s multinational assessment of economic voting discovered evidence supporting the ""grievance asymmetry"" hypothesis, which argues that whether or not voters choose to vote is dependent on the nature of economic change. In contrast to expecting coefficients on improving economic conditions to be near zero (Lewis-Beck, 1988, p.78), the authors found significant differences in the scope of the effect between improving and deteriorating economic conditions (van der Brug et al., 2007, pp.142-159)."," The hypothesis of Mueller regarding voters only reacting to economic circumstances if there is a sharp downturn receives support from research data in Germany and the United Kingdom (referencing Nannestad and Paldam, 1997, p.85). However, what about the applicability of this hypothesis to examining individual voters? Earlier efforts to verify the ""grievance hypothesis"" at an individual level (as cited in Kiewiet, 1983 and Lewis-Beck, 1988) proved unsuccessful, with the exception of examining the Danish electorate (Nannestad and Paldam, 1997).

" The outcomes of previous individual-level simulations relating to elections and economic conditions in Greece suggested that voters responded positively to the enhancements in the country's economy, leading to a reward for the governing party regarding their vote intentions. Greece's lack of coalition governments made it easy for voters to pinpoint the party accountable for governmental actions, resulting in a high-clarity political setting. Greece's political system is known for having stable single-party governments due to its disproportionate electoral system referred to as ""reinforced proportional representation"" that has been modified numerous times since the return to democracy in 1974. All parties, except for the quasicaretaker coalition governments of 1989-1990, have remained in opposition while ND and PASOK have taken turns in government."," According to previous individual-level simulations exploring the impact of economic changes on the electoral results in Greece, voters tended to reward the governing party when the economy improved. This happened slightly more than they gave them punishments. Greece has a political setting with high-clarity for voters due to the country's lack of coalition governments. It's easy to identify the party accountable for government policies. The political system in Greece has been stable with single-party governments due to the disproportional electoral system called ""reinforced proportional representation,"" which has undergone several changes since the restoration of democracy in 1974. Except for 1989-1990's quasicaretaker coalition governments, the ND and PASOK have served in government by alternating roles, while all other parties remained in opposition."," Previous simulations analyzing the effect of economic changes on elections in Greece at the individual-level disclosed that voters responded positively to advancements in the country's economy, granting the governing party a reward in terms of vote intentions. They were slightly more likely to do so than to punish the governing party. Greece's absence of coalition governments allowed voters to easily identify the party responsible for government policies, making it a high-clarity country. Since democracy's restoration in 1974, Greece has a stable single-party government system, partly thanks to the disproportional electoral system known as ""reinforced proportional representation,"" which has undergone multiple revisions. With the exception of 1989-1990's quasicaretaker coalition governments, the ND and PASOK have traded positions in government, while all other parties have remained in opposition."
" The plot observable in Fig. 1 (bandwidth of 0.7) presents an ambiguous view, but some indications suggest the presence of an asymmetry between the economy's state's fluctuations and the incumbent party's vote share. Upon scrutinizing macroeconomic indicators in isolation, we become cognizant of the association between a downturn in GDP and a decline in the incumbent party's vote share and vice versa, where an upturn in GDP rewards incumbents only up to a threshold of 2.5% change. Also, inflation up to 17% does not deter the voters' inclination towards the ruling party; instead, they seem to be slightly rewarding the party. Conversely, after the same threshold, there is a sharp decrease in the incumbent party's vote share. Similarly, changes in the unemployment rate from -1% to 1% are insignificant factors with respect to changes in the ruling party's vote share. Still, as with inflation, a pronounced trend recurs after the threshold, signaling punishment for incumbents, albeit the sample size beyond the threshold is meager."," In Fig. 1, the scatterplots (0.7 bandwidth) exhibit an inconclusive picture, but certain evidence proposes an asymmetry amid fluctuations in the economy's state and the vote share possessed by the governing party. The study of each macroeconomic indicator by itself reveals that a fall in GDP is correlated with a drop in the incumbent party's vote share and vice versa. The indications display that an upswing in GDP is a reward to incumbents, but only up till a threshold of 2.5% change. Inflation is another area of study, where voters don¡¯t seem to penalize the ruling party for a rise in the inflation rate of up to about 17%; instead, they tend to reward them slightly. However, beyond this threshold, there is a noticeable and steep downfall of the incumbent party's vote share. Similarly, changes in the unemployment rate ranging from -1% to 1% reveal no observable effect on changes in the incumbent party's vote share. But, just like inflation, there is a sharp trend past the threshold, hinting at punishment for incumbents. Nevertheless, the number of observations beyond the threshold limit is small."," The scatterplots shown in Fig. 1 (with 0.7 bandwidth) present a mixed viewpoint, but there are some indications of an asymmetry between the fluctuations in the state of the economy and the vote share of the governing party. Examining each macroeconomic indicator individually shows that decreases in GDP are connected to drops in the vote share of the incumbent party and vice versa, but a threshold of 2.5% change seems to be the point where incumbents no longer receive rewards for improving growth indicators. Analyzing inflation demonstrates that up to around 17%, increases in the inflation rate are not linked to a decline in the vote share of the incumbent party. Furthermore, voters appear to be slightly rewarding the party. Yet, beyond this threshold, there is a marked decline in the vote share for the ruling party. The same holds for changes in the unemployment rate, where adjustments between -1% and 1% do not seem to affect the vote share of the governing party. Nevertheless, as with inflation, after the threshold, there is a pronounced trend signifying a punishment for incumbents, but the number of observations beyond this threshold is minimal."
" To investigate the impact of economic variables on the support for the incumbent party, I performed a logistic regression analysis. I coded the dependent variable as 1 with the intention to vote for the incumbent and 0 for voting for any other opposition party, which has been previously established by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2000) and Evans and Andersen (2006). The logistic regression model enabled me to estimate the probability of voters selecting the incumbent party compared to others, and to analyze how this probability changes based on shifts in economic perceptions. Nonetheless, it is known that in most studies, vote choice is influenced by temporary factors such as economic evaluations, long-term effects such as party identification and ideology, and demographic factors like age and gender (Clarke et al., 2004)."," As my research focused on the impact of economic variables on support for the incumbent party, I employed a logistic regression analysis. My dependent variable was coded as 1 to indicate an intention to vote for the incumbent and as 0 for any other opposition party, based on the established coding by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2000) and Evans and Andersen (2006). Through the use of logistic regression models, I was able to estimate the likelihood of a voter selecting the incumbent party and track how this likelihood changes as perceptions of the economy evolve. However, it should be noted that vote choice is typically impacted by a range of factors including temporary effects like economic evaluations, long-term effects like party identification and ideology, and demographic features such as age and gender (Clarke et al., 2004)."," To understand how economic variables influence support for the incumbent party, I conducted a logistic regression analysis. The dependent variable was coded as 1 for those intending to vote for the incumbent party and 0 for those intending to vote for opposition parties, which was a coding method that had been previously established (Lewis-Beck and Nadeau, 2000; Evans and Andersen, 2006). Utilizing logistic regression models, I was able to estimate the likelihood of a voter selecting the incumbent party compared to other parties, and observe how this likelihood changes when economic perceptions shift. Nevertheless, as is common in most studies, vote choice is influenced by various factors such as temporary effects such as economic evaluations, long-term effects such as party identification and ideology, and demographic factors like age and gender (Clarke et al., 2004)."
" When comparing the 2004 and 2009 elections, Fig. 2 shows a rise of almost 20% in the percentage of voters who had a negative evaluation of the economy. The importance of the economy as the most pressing issue for voters increased considerably, and economic issues such as inflation and unemployment were the most significant for voters in both years. The Greek public indicated that the economy, inflation, and unemployment were the most important issues the country faced during both elections. The importance of the economy as an election issue became more critical in 2009, followed by a decrease in unemployment's significance as an issue. In both surveys, the economy had to be a crucial element in voters' minds for economic considerations to impact their overall voting decisions."," According to Fig. 2, the percentage of voters who evaluated the economy negatively increased by almost 20% when comparing the 2004 and 2009 elections. In 2004, the percentage of voters who thought the economy was a lot worse was only 24.4%, compared to a significant increase in 2009, where it increased to 43.9%. The study found that the economy had to be a significant concern for voters if economic considerations were to play an important role in their decisions. Both surveys asked respondents an open-ended question to name the most pressing problem the country faced. Both the 2004 and 2009 elections showed that economic issues, including inflation and unemployment, were by far the most significant for voters, surpassing concerns about health, immigration, education, and the environment. There was a notable shift from 2004 to 2009, with the economy's importance as the most significant problem increasing, followed by a decline in the importance of unemployment as an issue."," From Fig. 2, the comparison between the 2004 and 2009 elections suggests that the percentage of voters who evaluated the economy negatively rose by almost 20%.

"Table 1 illustrates the empirical outcomes of the study, which demonstrate that the economic variable coefficients align with the initial hypothesis and are statistically significant. The research found that in the 2004 national election, those on the left side of the ideological spectrum were more likely to support the socialist governing party, PASOK, as were those who identified with the incumbent and viewed the economic situation positively in the year preceding the election. Additionally, none of the sociodemographic variables had any considerable significance. The pattern observed in 2009 was repeated. Voters with a favorable view of the economy were more likely to vote for the incumbent party, which happened to be the right-wing ND. As a result, individuals on the right side of the ideological spectrum also inclined towards the ND. The study concluded that economic evaluations held by the Greek electorate had a significant effect on support for the incumbent party, even when the macroeconomic measures indicated favorable outcomes as was the case in 2004.","The empirical outcomes of the study are presented in Table 1, and the results support the initial hypothesis. The statistical analysis shows that the coefficients for the economic variable are significant and aligned as expected. The study also found that, in the 2004 national election, individuals on the left side of the ideological spectrum were more likely to support the socialist party, PASOK. This pattern remained consistent in voters who held a positive perception of the economy and those who identified with the incumbent. Furthermore, the sociodemographic factors were not found to have any significant effect. The same tendencies were observed in the 2009 election, where individuals with a positive view of the economy were more likely to vote for the incumbent, the conservative ND. As a result, voters on the right also tended to shift toward the ND.

Furthermore, none of the sociodemographic factors were found to have a statistically significant impact. The same pattern emerged in the 2009 election, where voters who held an optimistic opinion of the economy were more likely to vote for the incumbent, the conservative ND.

" Addressing endogeneity in regression models based on cross-sectional data is challenging as we don't have suitable exogenous instruments. Instead, a counterfactual argument is presented. If we think of endogeneity as an omitted variable problem, we need to consider the potential effect size of this variable to invalidate the findings presented in Table 1. Given that the model includes powerful predictors such as party identification and left-right self-placement, it's difficult to conceive of another explanatory variable that could predict incumbent party support with an odds ratio of at least 1.8.3.

" The article aims to investigate how the economy affects voting behavior in Greece during the 2004 and 2009 elections and how it relates to support for incumbent parties. The findings suggest that, in line with other countries, Greek voters tend to penalize the ruling party when the economy deteriorates rather than reward them when the conditions improve. However, the techniques used to analyze the data have limitations, and it is challenging to draw definite conclusions.

" Figs. 4 and 5 demonstrate a correlation between positive evaluations about the economy and an increase in the likelihood to vote for the incumbent party.

It is affirmed that economic evaluations played a crucial role in both elections, but it didn't have a substantial impact in terms of electoral returns for the party in government, which can be concluded from the evidence in Figs. 4 and 5. Especially in 2009, the high odds ratio of about 23.7 meant that only the most loyal supporters of the conservatives intended to vote for the incumbent ND, as confirmed by the parliamentary election of October 2009, where ND had the worst electoral result in its 35-year history, as per Gemenis (2010, 358)."," While the results don't indicate that there was no economic voting that took place in 2009, it is confirmed that economic evaluations indeed played a significant role in both elections. However, when we consider the evidence presented in Figs. 4 and 5, it is concluded that this important role didn't have a substantial impact on electoral returns for the party in government. In particular, the parliamentary election of October 2009 showed that the high odds ratio of about 23.7 for party identification in Table 1 only meant that the loyal supporters of the conservatives intended to vote for the incumbent ND. This was further confirmed by ND's worst electoral result in its 35-year history."," The outcomes do not suggest that there was no economic voting in 2009, rather they confirm that economic assessments played a vital role in both elections. However, the evidence presented in Figs. 4 and 5 leads to the conclusion that this crucial role was not substantial enough to affect electoral returns for the party in governance. This is particularly true for the parliamentary election of October 2009, where the high odds ratio of about 23.7 for party identification in Table 1 indicated that in June 2009 only the most loyal supporters of the conservatives intended to vote for the incumbent ND. The authenticity of this indication was solidified by the election result in which ND had their worst performance in the last 35 years, as reported by Gemenis (2010, 358)."
" The literature pertaining to economic voting has proven that good economic performance is beneficial to those in power during elections. However, there is still an ongoing debate regarding whether those in vulnerable economic situations are more prone to casting economic votes. This article suggests that a crucial element in explaining individual-level variation in economic voting is the level of exposure to economic risks, as it has a direct impact on how important the economy is in voting choices. In particular, the article concentrates on job insecurity and employability as being central to economic voting patterns. It hypothesizes that the level of economic voting is greater for those who are more vulnerable to unemployment and less able to find alternative work in the case of job loss. The results of the test, which used a dataset combining both survey data on incumbent support and occupational unemployment rates, as well as other measures of exposure to economic risks, supported the hypotheses."," According to economic voting literature, an incumbent's chances of winning are higher when the economic performance is impressive. However, there is still a disagreement as to whether voters in feeble economic conditions are more prone to engage in economic voting. This article proposes that the degree of exposure to economic risks plays a significant role in explaining variations in individual-level economic voting, as risk exposure directly impacts the significance of the economy in voting decisions. The article focuses on job insecurity and employability as key determinants of economic voting patterns. It conjectures that voters who are more vulnerable to unemployment and less employable in case of job loss are more likely to vote based on economic reasons. Analysis of the dataset, which combined survey data on incumbent support with occupational unemployment rates and other indicators of exposure to economic risks, supported the hypotheses."," The literature on economic voting demonstrates that incumbents' chances of re-election are boosted by good economic performance. Nevertheless, the question persists as to whether voters in vulnerable economic conditions are more inclined to engage in economic voting. In this article, it is argued that the level of exposure to economic risks is a critical factor that explains individual-level variations in economic voting because risk exposure directly impacts the importance of the economy in voting decisions. Job insecurity and employability are viewed as key determinants of economic voting patterns, with the article hypothesizing that the level of economic voting is higher in voters who are more susceptible to unemployment and have fewer employment opportunities in the event of job loss. The hypotheses are supported by a test using a dataset that combines survey data on incumbent support with occupational unemployment rates and other measures of exposure to economic risks."
" Economic voting is a well-researched topic in political science, which examines the relationship between economic factors and electoral outcomes. While there are some disagreements in the literature, the idea that macroeconomic performance is a critical determinant in democratic elections has become widely accepted among the general public and popular media. However, recent research has challenged this notion in two main areas: individual constraints and institutional factors. Studies show that individuals vary significantly in their ability and willingness to obtain information about the economy, and political institutions can play a significant role in influencing voters' perceptions of incumbents' economic performance."," Political science has thoroughly examined the connection between economic factors and electoral outcomes, which is known as economic voting. Despite debates in some areas of the literature, most people outside the field of study and the media agree that macroeconomic performance is a crucial determinant in democratic elections. However, recent research has called this idea into question regarding two key empirical and theoretical dimensions - individual constraints and institutional factors. Studies indicate that people's abilities and willingness to acquire information about the economy vary greatly, and political institutions can significantly affect how voters hold incumbents accountable for economic outcomes."," There is a vast amount of literature in political science that centers around the nexus between economic factors and electoral outcomes, which is called economic voting. While there are persistent areas of debate within this field, most non-experts and the general press agree that macroeconomic performance is critically important in democratic elections. However, recent research has challenged this view, identifying two main areas of empirical and theoretical criticism: individual constraints and institutional factors. One the one hand, studies suggest that individuals vary significantly in their ability and willingness to obtain information about the economy. On the other hand, political institutions can powerfully influence economic voting by shaping how voters hold incumbents responsible for economic performance."
" This article aims to make two significant contributions to the economic voting literature. Firstly, it seeks to identify individual-level differences in voting behavior by drawing on the insights from political science literature. The study explores the factors that mediate the relationship between macroeconomic performance and incumbent support, with a particular focus on 'skills' and professional job insecurity, which are key sources for social policy preferences and welfare state arrangements, but still remain largely unexplored for economic voting. Secondly, the study offers new empirical evidence that suggests voters respond differently to variations in macroeconomic performance based on their position in the labor market.

" The issue of how individual economic conditions influence voting patterns has been largely ignored in economic voting studies. Most scholars have regarded the economy as a 'valence issue', where all voters desire a good economy. As a result, many studies have centered on responsibility attribution, assuming that economic performance's significance remains constant across individual voters. However, some classic studies have provided a theoretical basis for exploring how group variances in responsiveness to macroeconomic signals may impact economic voting patterns, such as Hibbs' (1977) famous research that demonstrated differences across the electorate in response to indicators such as inflation and unemployment."," Economic voting studies have been hesitant to investigate how individual economic circumstances affect voting behavior. Stokes (1963) coined the term 'valence issue,' which implies that all voters prefer a good economy to a poor one. Responsibility assignment has been the primary focus of numerous studies, where scholars have assumed that voters perceive economic performance similarly. Scholars have referred to this paradigm frequently in economic voting literature. However, classic studies such as Hibbs' (1977) laid the foundation for exploring the role of individual economic status in influencing economic voting patterns. They observed disparities in groups' responsiveness to macroeconomic signals such as unemployment and inflation."," The influence of individual economic conditions on voting patterns has been a topic that many economic voting studies have not explored. According to Stokes' (1963) groundbreaking work, the economy is mostly considered a 'valence issue,' where all voters are likely to favor a good economy compared to a poor one. Most scholars have aimed to assign responsibility in electoral competitions for the macroeconomic performance depicted by the competing political parties. This paradigm has been prevalent throughout the economic voting literature, and many researchers have assumed that the salience of economic performance is consistent across all voters. However, some classic studies, such as the work of Hibbs (1977), have paved the way for conceptualizing the impact of individual economic conditions on economic voting patterns, which highlighted that different groups within the electorate react to the macroeconomic signals in different ways such as inflation and unemployment."
" This paragraph provides two main contributions to the current debate. Specifically, it emphasizes the importance of integrating research on economic voting with the literature on social policy preferences. It suggests that an individual's position in the labour market is crucial in determining their views on social insurance, as well as shaping economic voting patterns. At a larger level, these differences in risk exposure lead to significant variations in voting behaviour across different occupational groups. Moreover, this article conducts empirical research to test the argument, utilizing occupational unemployment data - a critical concept in the discussion of social policy preferences and the origins of the welfare state. It also puts forward a range of alternative methods for measuring the idea of 'risk exposure' to determine the robustness of its results."," This passage presents two principal arguments in the ongoing debate. Firstly, it highlights the need for a close integration of studies on economic voting and social policy preferences. The article posits that an individual's position in the labour market plays a pivotal role in shaping both their preference for social insurance and economic voting patterns. At a broader level, the resulting differences in risk exposure lead to significant variations in voting behaviour among various occupational groups. Secondly, the article conducts the first empirical assessment of this argument, using occupational unemployment data - a crucial topic in the conversation surrounding social policy preferences and the genesis of the welfare state. Additionally, a range of alternative metrics for determining the concept of 'risk exposure' are proposed to confirm the robustness of its findings."," The article offers two major contributions to the ongoing debate.

" <MASK> While it is evident that the economic voting literature needs to merge with other branches of political science, such as social policy preferences, this has been backed up by extensive scholarly studies. There is a significant imbalance in the distribution of economic risks among the electorate, resulting in variations in both preferences about redistribution and the macro-level welfare state arrangements. There are two categories of individual-level aspects that determine the exposure of individual voters to the economic cycle. The first concept explains that professional skills acquired through education and professional practices correlate positively with the degree of risk exposure. The second perspective proposes that job insecurity is the primary factor determining risk exposure, rather than employability. Furthermore, industry affiliation shapes job security through various channels."," <MASK> The results of critical articles suggest that there must be closer collaboration between the economic voting literature and other significant branches of political science, such as social policy preferences. Academic studies have established that the distribution of economic risks across the electorate is severely unequal, leading to disparities in preferences for redistribution and macro-level welfare state arrangements. There are two primary individual-level factors that determine the extent of exposure to the economic cycle of individual voters. One analysis suggests that the specificity of professional skills acquired through education and professional practices is positively related to the level of risk exposure. Workers with non-transferable skills are more vulnerable to extended unemployment in case of job loss. Another perspective proposes that job insecurity, rather than employability, is the main factor influencing risk exposure. The industry category plays a critical role in determining job security through various channels."," <MASK> The research from seminal articles indicates that the economic voting literature would benefit from closer integration with other branches of political science, particularly social policy preferences. Scholarly studies have provided ample evidence that economic risks are unevenly distributed among the electorate, leading to discrepancies in both preferences for redistribution and macro-level welfare state arrangements. Two main individual-level factors determine the voters' exposure to the economic cycle. According to one analysis, professional skills acquired through education and professional practices have a positive correlation with the level of risk exposure. Non-transferable skills make workers more vulnerable to prolonged unemployment if they lose their job. In contrast, another perspective suggests that job insecurity, not employability, is the issue affecting the risk exposure. The category of industry affiliation plays a critical role in determining job security through various channels."
" The fundamental principles of the economic voting model state that there are two primary reasons why voters may be interested in the state of the macroeconomy. Firstly, voters may value the prosperity of the economy as an end in itself, and their economic decision-making may adhere to a ""sociotropic"" trend, meaning that they will support incumbent politicians only if they have contributed to the economic well-being of the country as a whole. Secondly, voters may care about economic performance because their personal financial outcomes in the future depend partly on the overall health of the national economy. To support the argument made in this article, it is critical to assume that economic voting occurs due to ""pocketbook"" concerns about how macroeconomic performance will impact individuals' personal finances. If voters did not consider how the overall economic performance influences their financial situation, then their susceptibility to economic risk would not be a relevant factor in their economic decision-making."," According to the core principles of the economic voting model, there are two main reasons why voters may take an interest in the macroeconomic performance of a country. Firstly, voters may view economic prosperity as inherently good, and their voting decisions may reflect a ""sociotropic"" pattern where they choose incumbents who have contributed to the well-being of the country's economy as a whole. Secondly, economic performance may matter to voters because their personal financial situation in the future is partly dependent on the overall health of the national economy. This article's argument relies on the assumption that economic voting to some extent is driven by ""pocketbook"" concerns about how macroeconomic performance will impact individuals' financial situation. If voters did not consider how the overall economic performance affects their personal finances, then their susceptibility to economic risk would not factor into their decision-making about voting."," The fundamental tenets of the economic voting model suggest that voters may be interested in the macroeconomic performance of a country for two main reasons. Firstly, voters may see the prosperity of the economy as an end in itself, and their voting behavior may follow a ""sociotropic"" trend in which they support incumbents only if they have improved the economic well-being of the country as a whole (Kinder & Kiewiet 1981). Secondly, economic performance matters to voters because their future financial outcomes depend, to some extent, on the health of the national economy. For the purposes of this article's argument, it is essential to assume that economic voting occurs due to ""pocketbook"" concerns about how macroeconomic performance will impact individuals' personal finances. Without these concerns, exposure to economic risk would not play a role in economic decision-making."
" The significance of the economy and how it varies among people has been noticeably overlooked in the literature on economic voting. The present article assumes that there are two fundamental relationships between the economic salience and voting behavior. Firstly, the article suggests that voters have limited cognitive abilities in receiving and processing information on specific political issues. It is said that under various constraints, individuals tend to consider only a few of their preferences while making decisions. Secondly, the article explains that voters don't assess candidates based on their performance in all policy areas. On the contrary, they tend to focus only on those areas they find interesting. This insight is important for economic voting because although all voters may prefer a competent economic manager, some might prioritize other attributes of the candidate."," The literature on economic voting has significantly under-researched the salience of the economy and its variations across the electorate. This article makes two critical assumptions regarding the relationship between economic salience and voting behavior. Firstly, it assumes that voters face substantial cognitive limitations in the way they receive and process information on specific political issues. This is consistent with foundational work on 'bounded rationality' by Herbert Simon. Empirical research in behavioral economics and social psychology also supports this idea of individuals considering only a few preferences while making decisions under different constraints. Secondly, voters tend to evaluate candidates only on policy areas they find most relevant and interesting, rather than all policy areas. This insight is imperative for economic voting since although having a competent economic manager is a priority for most voters, some may value other candidate attributes higher."," The economic salience and its variability among the electorate have been overlooked in the literature on economic voting. The article assumes that two important aspects are associated with the relationship between economic salience and voting behavior. The first aspect is that the voters' cognitive capacity in receiving and interpreting information on political issues is constrained. Simon's work on bounded rationality supports this claim. Additionally, empirical research in behavioral economics and social psychology has demonstrated that individuals tend to consider only a few preferences when making decisions given their constraints. Secondly, voters tend to assess candidates based on their performance in policy areas relevant to them, rather than assessing them on all policy areas. Hence, economic voting depends on the attributes the voters consider meaningful, and although having a competent economic manager might be important, voters may prioritize other attributes while casting their votes."
" Economic voting has been subject to extensive research. Recent studies have aimed to refine our understanding of the connection between macroeconomic performance and voting behavior, while also considering the varying levels of economic voting across nations and individuals. Researchers have recognized the significance of responsibility attribution and the cognitive processes involved in economic voting. However, this article highlights the importance of another overlooked aspect - social policy preferences and welfare state development. Categorizing voters based on their susceptibility to economic fluctuations provides valuable insight into economic voting. The study suggests that individuals with higher job insecurity are more likely to support incumbent governments if there is good macroeconomic performance."," There has been significant research on economic voting, with recent developments aiming to enhance our understanding of the links between macroeconomic performance and voting behavior. While the importance of economic voting is recognized, there are also substantial differences seen across individuals and countries. Scholars have examined responsibility attribution and individual-level characteristics that shape the economic voting model's cognitive processes. However, this article highlights a less studied dimension - social policy preferences and welfare state development. This study suggests categorizing voters by their vulnerability to economic fluctuations can prove instrumental in providing further insights into economic voting behavior. Empirical observations indicate that voters with greater job insecurity and lower employability are more likely to condition their support for incumbents based on good macroeconomic performance."," Economic voting has received significant attention from researchers in recent years. Studies have aimed to refine our understanding of the relationship between macroeconomic performance and voting behavior, accounting for the substantial differences witnessed across countries and individuals. The significance of responsibility attribution and individual-level characteristics have also been explored in these works.

The authors suggest grouping voters according to their economic vulnerability can help to shed light on the relationship between macroeconomic performance and voting behavior. Results from the study reveal that voters who face greater job insecurity and lower employability due to job loss are more likely to base their support for the incumbent government on good macroeconomic performance."
" The report presented positive results; however, the research design has limited the findings. This limitation draws potential areas for further investigation on how economic voting and economic risk are linked. The first limitation is that further studies should be conducted using actual voting data as the response variable. This study has only utilized public opinion measures, and although the analysis solely focused on respondents who intended to vote, disparities between voting intentions and actual voting choices, including those who didn't vote, remain unexamined. Secondly, the sample is narrow, consisting of only a small group of developed economies. Expanding the number of clusters in the sample can address possible methodological discrepancies in the estimation of standard errors for macro-level variables and explore interaction effects between cluster-level covariates. In addition, campaign-specific dynamics and communication strategies are key factors in election contests' economic relevance, which this study has not investigated. Finally, this report has not investigated the postulated causal mechanism."," The findings of this study are positive, but they must be understood in the context of certain limitations in the research design. These limitations suggest potential avenues for further exploration of the relationship between economic risk and economic voting. Firstly, the argument presented in this article needs to be verified using actual voting data, as the response variable used here is only a measure of public opinion. While the analysis has been restricted to those who expressed their intention to vote, this study does not account for discrepancies between such intentions and actual voting behavior or non-voting. Secondly, the sample size is limited to a small selection of advanced economies. Increasing the number of clusters in the sample could address the possible methodological shortcomings of the estimations of standard errors for macro-level variables and allow for the examination of interaction effects between cluster-level covariates. Additionally, the particular dynamics of each campaign and the strategies behind political communication play a crucial role in determining the significance of the economy in electoral contests, which were not considered in this study. Lastly, the causal mechanism that was proposed in this article has not been tested."," This study's positive results should be considered in relation to certain limitations in the research design, which can be further investigated to shed light on the connection between economic voting and economic risk. Firstly, the findings presented here must be tested using actual voting data, as the response variable utilized in this study measures public opinion instead of voting behaviors. This analysis covers respondents who intended to vote; however, the discrepancies between such intentions and the actual voting choices, including the act of not voting, have not been taken into account. Secondly, the sample size is restricted to a handful of developed economies. By increasing the number of clusters in the sample, any possible methodological flaws in the estimations of standard errors for macro-level variables can be identified, and the nature of the interaction effects between cluster-level covariates can be examined. Furthermore, the election-specific dynamics and political communication strategies, which were neglected in this study, play a crucial role in determining the economy's relevance in electoral contests. Finally, this study has not investigated the suggested causal mechanism."
" Figure 3 in the report presents a graphical representation that displays the differentiation between the two groups. The chart consists of two curves that predict incumbent support likelihoods based on GDP growth. One curve is solid and represents low-skill respondents. The other curve is dashed and depicts high-skill respondents. The chart shows that the curve for low-skill respondents has a steeper slope than the high-skill curve. This difference implies that macroeconomic fluctuations have a more substantial impact on low-skill respondents' support for the incumbent. During periods of bad economic performance like a -1% growth, low-skill respondents are likely to withdraw their support for the incumbent leading to a decrease in predicted incumbent support probability from 0.45 to 0.24. Meanwhile, high-skill respondents would only decrease their probability of incumbent support from 0.39 to 0.31. The chart further suggests that the divergence between the two groups is more prominent during times of economic crises than during times of economic prosperity. This finding may indicate that the two groups differ more in their willingness to condemn the incumbent for poor economic management than in their willingness to reward good economic performance."," Figure 3, included in the report, showcases a graphic representation that highlights the contrast between the two groups in question. This plot identifies two specific curves that predict the possibility of incumbent support concerning GDP growth. The chart exhibits one permanent curve that signifies the low-skill respondents and another dashed curve that characterizes the high-skill respondents. The graph suggests that the steady line belonging to low-skill respondents is steeper than the one belonging to the high-skill respondents. Hence, macroeconomic factors have a more considerable impact on the support that low-skill respondents offer to the incumbent during times of good or bad economic growth. For example, during a bad economic spectacle, such as -1% growth, the chart reveals that low-skill respondents can decrease incumbent support probability by a whopping 0.21, resulting in a reduction from 0.45 to 0.24. On the other hand, high-skill respondents would only decrease the possibility of incumbent support by 0.08, resulting in a reduction from 0.39 to 0.31. The visual representation further suggests that the rift between the two groups is more pronounced during times of economic crises compared to periods of economic prosperity. This evident disparity may indicate that the two groups differ primarily in their willingness to reprimand unproductive economic management versus their readiness to reward effective economic performance."," A graphical representation depicted in Figure 3 of the report displays the difference between the two groups by plotting two distinct curves that indicate the likelihood of incumbent support based on GDP growth. The solid curve represents the low-skill respondents, whereas the dashed curve depicts the high-skill respondents. The chart reveals that the curve for low-skill respondents is significantly steeper than the corresponding curve for high-skill respondents. This disparity suggests that macroeconomic fluctuations have a more substantial impact on low-skill respondents' support for the incumbent. For instance, during an economic downturn like a -1% growth, the chart illustrates that low-skill respondents are more likely to withdraw their support for the incumbent, leading to a decrease in the probability of incumbent support from 0.45 to 0.24. In contrast, high-skill respondents would only decrease this probability from 0.39 to 0.31. Furthermore, the chart suggests that the gap between the two groups is more pronounced during economic crises than times of economic prosperity. This outcome implies that the two groups differ primarily in their readiness to punish incumbents for bad economic governance compared to their willingness to reward them for good performance."
" The study employed models 3 to 5 to estimate the model in Equation 3, using different indicators of job insecurity. Model 3 evaluated macroeconomic growth with a dummy variable that measures the impact of unemployment on economic conditions, as unemployed respondents are in a particularly vulnerable economic condition. The estimation results in Table 2 showed that the coefficient for the interaction term is positive, although it is not statistically significant in either the simple logistic or the random effect model. Model 4 investigated the role of public sector employment as an indicator of job security, which demonstrated that the significance of public sector employment was barely significant in the random effect model and not significant in the simple regression model. In addition, the coefficient was positively signed and of modest magnitude, although it is contrary to expectations. Thus, no apparent difference was found in economic voting patterns between respondents employed in the public and private sectors. Lastly, models 5 and 5r offered empirical evidence that being a union member is indeed a vital element in economic voting behaviour."," Alternative measures of job insecurity were employed in models 3 to 5 to estimate the model in Equation 3. In Model 3, macroeconomic growth was interacted with a dummy variable measuring unemployment's impacts on economic conditions. The results of the estimation reported in Table 2 showed that the coefficient for the interaction term was positively signed, although it was not statistically significant in either the simple logistic or the random effect model. Model 4 analyzed employment in the public sector as an indicator of job security, and the findings revealed that the significance of public sector employment was almost statistically significant in the random effect model and not significant in the simple regression model. Furthermore, the coefficient was positively signed but small, which goes against the expected results. Therefore, there seems to be no apparent difference in economic voting patterns between public or private sector workers. Finally, models 5 and 5r provided empirical proof that membership in a union is a critical determinant in economic voting behaviour."," To estimate the model in Equation 3, the study used different measures of job insecurity in models 3 to 5. Model 3 examined macroeconomic growth with a dummy variable indicating whether the respondent is unemployed to assess the impact of unemployment on economic conditions. As the unemployment group is in a particularly vulnerable economic condition, we could anticipate a positive coefficient for the interaction term. The estimation presented in Table 2 showed that this was indeed the case, even though the coefficient was not significant at the 0.05 level in either the simple logistic or the random effect model. Model 4 assessed public sector employment as an indicator of job security, and the outcomes showed that the significance of public sector employment was barely significant in the random effect model (Model 4r) and not significant in the simple regression model. Additionally, contrary to expectations, the coefficient was positively signed and of modest magnitude. As a result, there does not seem to be a noticeable distinction in economic voting behaviour between respondents employed in the public or private sectors. Finally, estimates for Models 5 and 5r provided empirical evidence that being a member of a union is a crucial factor in economic voting behaviour."

" The objective of this research is to analyze and evaluate the transformation process in Hungary. The author asserts that the chief goal of this transformation was to shift towards a market economy from the previously implemented centrally planned approach. The attainment of this objective was, in our opinion, accomplished through Hungary's accession to the EU. As a result, the research only focuses on the period ending with 2004, which serves as an indirect indication that Hungary had achieved a well-functioning market economy. However, how this state was attained is an intriguing question as there are numerous transforming countries that are still a long way from a well-functioning market economy, such as Belarus. Our view is that the second goal of the transformation process was to change the overall trend of economic development towards more specific objectives. The earlier centrally planned system was not sustainable, causing economic growth to decrease, and in fact, negligible in the 1980s. As a result, the Hungarian economy lagged behind market economies. Without increasing economic growth, changes to the economy would be meaningless. This study evaluates the progress made towards achieving this goal."," The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and analyze the transformation process in Hungary. The main objective of this transformation, as the author sees it, was to shift from a centrally planned economy to a market economy paradigm. As per our understanding, this objective was fulfilled when Hungary joined the EU. Therefore, the paper focuses on the period ending in 2004, which reinforces the fact that Hungary had achieved a well-functioning market economy (this being a condition of EU membership). However, the question remains how this state was reached, as many transforming countries are still far from reaching the state of a working market economy (e.g., Belarus). The second goal of the transformation process was to change the general trend of economic development, which we consider to be a more particular goal. The centrally planned economy was failing, with economic growth declining in the 1980s, and Hungary was falling behind the market economies. Without enhancing economic growth, any attempts to change the economy's pattern would be of no value. The paper aims to assess the progress made in attaining this objective."," The goal of this study is to analyze and evaluate the transformation process in Hungary. According to the author's viewpoint, the primary objective of this transformation was to shift the economy from the centrally planned system to a market economy. Our opinion is that this goal was generally attained with Hungary's entry to the EU. For this reason, the research considers the period leading up to 2004, which serves as indirect evidence of the existence of a well-functioning market economy (which is a requirement for EU accession). Nonetheless, it remains essential to understand how this state was attained, given that several transforming countries have failed to achieve the well-functioning market economy (such as Belarus). The second objective of the transformation process was to alter the overall trend of economic development, which was regarded as a more particular goal. The centrally planned economy was doomed for failure, with economic growth declining and nearly non-existent in the 1980s. Consequently, the Hungarian economy was struggling to keep up with the market economies. Any changes in the economy without enhancing growth would be futile. The research aims to evaluate the progress made from this perspective."
" We shall commence by describing the political progress that took place in Hungary over the long run, which had a significant influence on the state of the Hungarian economy towards the conclusion of the 1980s. The second chapter will examine this aspect in depth. Subsequently, we will shift our focus to the political developments that occurred during the transformation era, which we have identified as the period extending from 1990 to 2004 (the EU accession period). We are of the opinion that accession to the EU can be viewed as compelling evidence for the state of the Hungarian economy. The following three chapters will analyze the key economic developments, including the sequence of reforms and the privatization process. These two chapters will provide a comprehensive insight into the primary economic measures undertaken. Finally, the last chapter will summarize the economic outcomes recorded during the study period, with specific subchapters delving into critical aspects such as economic growth, inflation, the structure of the economy, unemployment, and external relationships."," Our journey shall begin by illustrating the long-term political progress that took place in Hungary and had a considerable impact on the condition of the Hungarian economy towards the end of the 1980s.

" The problems we experienced while working on the paper pertained to the data. The chief issue was the length of the consistent data series since it was challenging to acquire relevant and homogenous data that covered the entire transformation period. As a result, we had to use shorter series. We consider the data we employed to be the most suitable that were obtainable."," During the course of our work on the paper, we encountered data-related difficulties. The major problem concerned the duration of the consistent data series, as we struggled to obtain pertinent and uniform data for the entire transformation period. Consequently, we employed truncated data series. We believe that the data we used were the best available."," While we were working on the paper, data troubles were one of the issues we faced.

" To fully comprehend Hungary's history and development during the transformation process, it's essential to adopt a broader perspective. The origins of Hungary's long-term economic development can be traced back to the First World War's aftermath, when it lost a considerable portion of its land to neighbouring states. This loss of territory caused a significant impact on the Hungarian people, and the government aimed to reunite all Hungarians under one state during the interwar years. To accomplish their goal, Hungary allied itself with Nazi Germany in the 1930s."," The primary focus of the text is Hungary's development during the transformation process, but it is crucial to note the broader picture to understand the country's historical significance. Hungary's long-term economic development has roots in the aftermath of the First World War. The country lost significant portions of its land to neighboring states, and this had a significant impact on the Hungarian population, with many Hungarian minorities living in Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. The Hungarian government aimed to reunite all Hungarians under one state during the interwar period, and to achieve this goal, Hungary became an ally of Nazi Germany in the 1930s."," The text primarily discusses Hungary's development during the transformation process, but it's necessary to take a broader perspective to gain a better understanding of the country. The roots of Hungary's long-term economic development lie in the aftermath of the First World War, a crucial event in Hungarian history. Following the war, Hungary experienced significant territorial losses to neighboring countries, resulting in the displacement of many Hungarian minorities into Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania. The Hungarian government aimed to reunite these people under one state during the interwar period, which led to the country becoming an ally of fascist Germany in the 1930s."
" The political situation in Hungary became increasingly relaxed over time, culminating in the establishment of an opposition party during the mid-1980s. Following negotiations that took place in 1989, significant changes were made to the constitution in favor of democracy, human rights, market economy, and the prevention of any one party ruling in the parliament. This milestone was reached on October 23, 1989, marking a new era of democratic government for Hungary. As a result, the country held genuine democratic elections in March 1990, and successfully avoided any form of unrepresentative government."," Gradual political relaxation took place in Hungary, and by the mid-1980s, opposition parties began to emerge. In 1989, negotiations occurred at the round table, leading to crucial alterations to the constitution that would ensure that Hungary would transition to a democratic government that upholds human rights, a market-oriented economy, and disallows any single political party from obtaining total dominance. This constitutional change was ratified on October 23, 1989, and marked the beginning of Hungary's new democratic era. Without the formation of a unity government or pseudo-democracy, Hungary had its first truly democratic election in March 1990."," The political climate in Hungary became more relaxed over time, which resulted in the formation of an opposition party by the mid-1980s. Talks were held at the round table in 1989, and the subsequent constitutional amendments cemented the transition to a democratic system based on human rights, market economics, and a formal ban on any single-party rule, even when the party has a majority in parliament. On October 23, 1989, this constitutional change was officially approved, heralding a new democratic era for Hungary. As a direct result, free and fair elections were held in March 1990, without resorting to pseudo-democracy or a government of national unity."
" The Hungarian economy's growth was immediately affected by political developments. The country adopted a centrally planned system after World War II, which had certain differences from other systems in the region but nonetheless had similar underpinnings. While the Hungarian system wasn't as harsh as Czechoslovakia's, the introduction of reforms from 1968 onwards led to even greater divergence between the two systems."," Political changes had an immediate effect on the development of the Hungarian economy. Following World War II, the country implemented a centrally planned system that, though it had different features from other systems in the region, shared a similar foundation. The Hungarian system was generally less strict than Czechoslovakia's system, but as reforms began to be implemented after 1968, the differences between the two systems became more pronounced."," The development of the Hungarian economy was immediately influenced by political changes.

" Hungary became the pioneering country in Central Europe to adopt a value added tax system as it was incorporated in 1988. Also, they had liberalized 63% of all prices by 1989. The forint was prone to continuous reductions in value, declining from 45.8 to USD in 1986 to 63.2 in 1990, according to Vintrov¨¢ (1992)."," Hungary was the leader in Central Europe in including value-added tax in the tax system, which happened in 1988. Furthermore, almost two-thirds of prices were liberalized by 1989. The forint experienced consistent devaluation, dipping from 45.8 to USD in 1986 to 63.2 in 1990 (Vintrov¨¢, 1992)."," In 1988, Hungary emerged as the first country in Central Europe to incorporate value-added tax into the tax system. The liberalization of about 63% of all prices had already occurred by 1989. Additionally, there were persistent devaluations of the forint, with its value decreasing from 45.8 to USD in 1986 to 63.2 in 1990, as documented by Vintrov¨¢ (1992)."
" The private sector's contribution to the national product was 3% as stated by Bethkenhagen (1989) in 1970. According to Holman (2000), it had increased to more than 25% by 1989, and two-thirds of Hungarians had a source of income from private activities along with their primary job in a state company or cooperative. While this is much higher than Czechoslovakia's numbers, it still isn't enough to establish a fully functional market economy."," In 1970, the private sector made up just 3% of the national product according to Bethkenhagen (1989). However, by 1989, that number had risen significantly to over 25%, as reported by Holman (2000). As many as two-thirds of Hungarians had a secondary income from private activities, in addition to their primary employment at a state company or cooperative. Although these figures were significantly higher than those of Czechoslovakia, they still fell short of a robust market economy."," According to Bethkenhagen's (1989) findings, the private sector only accounted for 3% of the national product in 1970. However, by 1989, the private sector had grown to create over one quarter of the national product, as per Holman's (2000) research. Additionally, nearly two-thirds of Hungarians had an extra source of income from private activities while working in a state company or a cooperative. Although these figures were several times higher in comparison to Czechoslovakia, they still did not reflect a fully developed market economy."
" The communist reign in Hungary saw the economy experiencing significant fluctuations in growth, which were more pronounced than in Czechoslovakia. While the 1950s saw strong growth, subsequent decades were marked by a decline in the economy's growth that plummeted to very low levels in the 1980s. Despite introducing economic reforms, these changes did not translate into improvement in economic growth trends but instead led to declining results. A clear depiction of this trend is shown in a figure provided in the text."," The impact of the communist reign is evident in the Hungarian economy, which witnessed significant fluctuations in growth - more than its Czechoslovakian counterpart. Strong growth was experienced in the 1950s, but subsequent decades saw a decline that resulted in  very low growth rates during the 1980s. Despite the introduction of economic reforms, the trends of economic growth remained unchanged, and results continued to worsen rather than improve.

" The initial free elections occurred in March/April of 1990, as we previously mentioned. A post-communist government, led by Jozsef Antall (1932-1993), was established. The administration was centred around Christian and national parties and skewed to the right. Its stability was provided by a solid majority of 60% in Parliament. One of its accomplishments was the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Hungary during 1991. Similarly, an association agreement with the European Community was finalised that year."," As previously mentioned, March/April of 1990 saw the first free elections take place.

" In 1994, the left wing party called MSZP, which has origins in post-communism, won the elections with a vast majority. However, the tough economic conditions forced them to implement strict economic measures, which will be discussed in detail later. After the 1998 elections, a right wing coalition was established with Fidesz as the main party. During their tenure, Hungary joined NATO. Although Fidesz won the 2002 elections as well, they were powerless to form a government, and a coalition of left wing parties assumed power instead."," Following the elections in 1994, the MSZP, a post-communist left wing party, emerged victorious with a huge majority. Owing to the economic situation of the country, they had to introduce some robust economic policies, which will be explained later. The 1998 elections resulted in a right wing government coalition, led by the Fidesz party. Under their leadership, Hungary became a member of NATO. Fidesz won the next elections in 2002, but they weren't able to form a government as left wing parties toppled them."," In 1994, the MSZP, a left wing party originated from post-communism, claimed a landslide victory in the general elections.

Fidesz triumphed again in the 2002 elections but failed to form a government, which was instead established by a coalition of left wing parties."
" Hungary maintained democratic principles throughout the entire period and became part of the European Union in 2004. However, there has been a prolonged discontent with Hungary's transformation process and overall quality of life. The results of a 2006 survey illustrate this dissatisfaction, which cannot be reasonably explained. One possible explanation is the high hopes Hungarians had in the late 1980s and their general contentment with the semi-capitalist system of goulash communism."," Throughout the entire period, Hungary remained committed to democratic principles and was admitted into the European Union in 2004. However, there has been a persistent dissatisfaction with the country's transformation process and overall quality of life.

" The discussion of reforms during the transformation period in Hungary was similar to what was happening in other countries. However, one distinctive feature of Hungary was that its communist party started implementing reforms before the fall of the regime, which led many Hungarians to believe that it was unnecessary to initiate radical reforms. Rather, they believed that slower reforms could bring the same outcomes with lower costs. Nevertheless, advocates of shock therapy were not convinced that the government possessed the capacity to establish a market economy. The initial stage of the Hungarian transformation is often regarded as gradualist. Nonetheless, there remains an ongoing debate about what constitutes gradualism. Several Hungarian measures, especially the bankruptcy law, were perceived as being exceedingly radical. In the second subchapter, the focus is on the reforms that transpired in the mid-1990s, while the third subchapter concentrates on the period after the turn of the century."," Hungary's discussion of reforms during the transformation period was similar to what was happening in other nations. The unique feature that set Hungary apart was that the communist party had already implemented reforms before the fall of the regime. As a result, Hungarians believed that radical reforms were not necessary, and that slower reforms could achieve similar results with less cost. However, proponents of shock therapy distrusted the government's ability to establish a market economy. Consequently, the first phase of Hungary's transformation is often described as gradualist, though there is some controversy over what gradualism means. Some measures, such as the bankruptcy law, were considered highly radical. The second subchapter details the reforms that occurred in the mid-1990s, while the third subchapter focuses on the period after the turn of the century."," Hungary's approach to reforms during the transformation period was not dissimilar to what was happening in other countries.

" The Hungarian economy faced macroeconomic imbalances that were previously mentioned. According to Laki (1993), the Antall government's key objectives were to maintain the country's creditworthiness, reduce inflation, and manage the growing public deficit. The most complex task was to reduce the public deficit after the fall of the communist regime since state income declined while there were efforts to lower expenditures. Moreover, the government took on the responsibility of public service-providing late-state companies, which contributed to an increase in expenditure (Allen, Hass, 2001)."," As stated earlier, the Hungarian economy was affected by macroeconomic imbalances. Laki (1993) highlighted that the Antall government was tasked with three main objectives, which were to uphold the country's creditworthiness, mitigate inflation, and address the increasing public deficit. The most arduous challenge was to tackle the public deficit after the fall of the communist regime, given the decrease in state income and the difficulty of reducing expenses simultaneously. Furthermore, the government assumed responsibility for late-stated companies that provided social services, leading to higher spending (Allen, Hass, 2001)."," Macro imbalance was identified as one of the issues plaguing the Hungarian economy as mentioned previously. Laki (1993) outlined three major tasks for the Antall government, which were to maintain the country's creditworthiness, control inflation, and manage the public deficit, the latter being the most difficult to address after the fall of the communist regime. The state's revenue decreased, while expenses remained high, making it challenging to reduce the public deficit. Additionally, the government frequently took over the responsibility of late state companies providing social services, incurring further spending (Allen, Hass, 2001)."
" The Hungarian government decided to implement reforms in both the business and financial sectors while simultaneously making efforts to improve the country's legal system, privatize state-owned enterprises, and strengthen antitrust policies. However, their approach to bankruptcy legislation was highly questionable as the new code enacted in 1992 was quite austere. If a company was not able to pay off its debts within 90 days, it was required to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. The law remained in effect for 18 months which led to the bankruptcy of 5,000 subjects who collectively contributed to 10% of Hungary's GDP. Although this bankruptcy proceeding served as a method of privatization, it had unintended negative repercussions for the banks as the number of classified credits continued to rise. By comparison, the Czech Republic's bankruptcy legislation was weaker during the same period; the first law was approved only in 1993 and did not apply to companies yet to be privatized."," The Hungarian government adopted reforms in the business and financial sectors while simultaneously making efforts to enhance the legal system, privatization processes, antitrust laws, and bankruptcy laws, which is highly doubtful considering the implementation of bankruptcy legislation. They enacted a strict new code in 1992, and if a company could not pay off its debts within 90 days, it had to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. After 18 months, the new code led to the bankruptcy of 5,000 subjects that contributed to approximately 10% of Hungary's GDP. Interestingly, this bankruptcy procedure served as a method of privatization since nearly 500 prominent bankrupt companies were shifted to private ownership. This move had an unwanted impact on banks due to the increase in classified credits. In comparison, the Czech Republic's bankruptcy legislation was relatively weak during the same period; they approved their first law only in 1993, which did not apply to companies seeking privatization."," Despite enacting reforms in the business and financial sectors concurrently with improvements to the legal system, privatization measures, and antitrust policies, the approach to bankruptcy legislation taken by the Hungarian government was questionable. In 1992, a stringent new code was introduced, requiring companies unable to pay their debts within 90 days to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. After 18 months, 5,000 entities were declared bankrupt, which represented around 10% of the country's GDP. This bankruptcy process functioned simultaneously as a method of privatization, resulting in the transfer of nearly 500 large bankrupt companies to private ownership. Unfortunately, the growth in classified credits had unintended negative consequences for affected banks. In comparison, the Czech Republic's bankruptcy legislation remained relatively weak during the same period, with the first law not approved until 1993 and not applied to companies scheduled for privatization."
" Hungary's economic progress in the given period was unfavorable. Despite aiming for a gradual reform approach, it was unable to avoid the recession caused by transformation. Hungary underwent a similar or even more severe decline than other nations in Central Europe resulting in a high unemployment rate rate. Unlike in other countries, inflation did not show a significant increase following the price liberalization; however, it remained consistently higher. Despite this, Hungary experienced a relatively high inflow of foreign capital, which was linked to the previous liberalization, and foreign investors being well-informed about Hungary. In contrast, Hungary experienced a current account deficit."," During the indicated period, Hungary's economic outcomes were not positive.

Hungary suffered a decline that was comparable, if not worse than what other Central European countries experienced, resulting in relatively high unemployment.

" The government implemented these steps with the goal of reducing public finance and trade balance deficits while promoting competition in the economy. However, these measures resulted in harsh consequences such as a 10% decline in government spending as a percentage of GDP in 1995, and real wages decreasing by 12% then by 4% the next year. Additionally, the economy grew at a slower pace with a growth rate of only 1% in both 1995 and 1996. Despite this, there were also positive outcomes such as the reduction of trade deficit between 1994 and 1996 and a decrease in government deficit (excluding privatization income) from 8.4% to 3% in the same period. The average deficit was relatively high at 5.5% of GDP between 1990 and 2004, making it worse than other Central European countries. The following figure presents an overview of public finance developments within the first decade."," The government implemented these measures with the aim of reducing both trade balance and public finance deficits, while simultaneously increasing competition in the economy.

" The application of the Bokros package resulted in positive economic development; however, this was short-lived, and Hungary experienced several difficulties at the start of the new century. The government's expenditures were held responsible for infamous fiscal problems, with public sector wages increasing by a staggering 12-13% in 2002. Additionally, there was a gradual rise in public finance deficit, indicating further instability. One of the reasons for the trade imbalance was a widespread slowdown of European economies, but the primary factor was the rise in wages that reduced competitiveness. The statements were made by Gabrisch and H?lscher in 2006."," Following the introduction of the Bokros package, there was a general consensus that the economic development of Hungary had improved, but unfortunately, it was short-lived. As the new century began, the Hungarian government faced a growing number of challenges in the fiscal field, largely due to its own expenses. In 2002, public sector wages rose between 12-13%, according to Gabrisch and H?lscher, causing a significant increase in public finance deficits that can be seen in the previous chart. Trade deficits also increased due to declining competitiveness, primarily resulting from high wage growth, despite being partly caused by the slow-down of European economies."," Although the Bokros package initially resulted in positive economic development, Hungary's prosperity period was short-lived.

Trade was another area of significant instability, as the trade deficit rose to between 6-8% of the GDP, in part due to the economic slowdown in Europe, but largely due to declining competitiveness caused by wage growth."
" In response to lasting inflation pressures, the central bank implemented a monetary restriction, which included a widening of the fluctuation band in May 2001. The implementation of the inflation targeting system and full convertibility of the currency followed in the summer of that year. In October, the crawling peg was abandoned, and the central parity of the forint was fixed. While the central bank shifted its focus to inflation targeting, it continued to maintain the central parity and fluctuation zone. This meant using interest rates as a tool to control both inflation and exchange rates, which was made challenging by the free movement of capital.

" The negative impact of increased inflation was the growth of foreign currency indebtedness, leading to a problematic trend in subsequent years. This phenomenon was particularly alarming for households that frequently acquired loans in Swiss francs or euros. The progress and increase of this type of borrowing can be witnessed in the graph below. The primary cause of this trend was the unfavorable difference between interest rates in Hungary and developed nations, in addition to the rising inflation rate. However, this borrowing pattern became problematic only if the exchange rate was stable or increasing, creating a dangerous situation."," As previously mentioned, the high inflation rate generated a pessimistic outcome of rising indebtedness in foreign currencies, which continued to exacerbate over the following years. This pattern was alarming, particularly for households that frequently secured mortgages in Swiss francs or euros. The following chart showcases the proportion and enlargement of this category of debt. This occurrence was predominantly caused due to a higher inflation rate and the fact that the interest rates in Hungary were consistently greater than those in developed nations. This borrowing trend can be fatal only if the exchange rate remains stable or increases, creating a hazardous condition."," The problem with soaring inflation was a detrimental trend of increasing indebtedness in foreign currencies, which persisted in subsequent years. This situation had severe implications, particularly for households that frequently obtained mortgages in Swiss francs or euros. The chart below illustrates the percentage and growth of this form of borrowing. This development was mainly triggered by higher inflation rates and the fact that interest rates in Hungary were higher than in developed countries. This harmful borrowing trend could only ensue issues under the condition that the exchange rate stabilized or appreciated, posing a dangerous situation."
" The trends of high government deficits discussed in Figure 2 did not translate into an increase in government debt during the period at hand, as indicated by the subsequent graph. Nonetheless, both trends of mounting government debt and indebtedness in foreign currencies inflicted significant harm on the Hungarian economy during the latter years of the 2000s."," We ought to observe the fact that despite the high government deficits mentioned above in Figure 2, there was no corresponding increase in government debt during our timeframe, as indicated by the chart that follows. Nevertheless, both negative trends of growing government debt and indebtedness in foreign currencies had serious consequences for the Hungarian economy in the latter half of the 2000s."," It is crucial to note that the elevated government deficits highlighted in Figure 2 did not result in an augmentation of government debt during the particular period as evident in the subsequent chart. Nonetheless, the two negative trends of a rising government debt and indebtedness in foreign currencies posed significant challenges to the Hungarian economy in the latter half of the 2000s."
" The role of state company managers differed greatly between the central European countries at the start of their transformation process. In Hungary, these managers were more widely accepted compared to in Czechoslovakia, where they were viewed as high-ranking communists. This disparity allowed Hungarian managers to gain control of thousands of companies by the late 1980s, leading to what is now known as ""spontaneous privatization."""," At the outset of the transformation process, there were notable distinctions between the central European countries.

" The survey's findings revealed the public's stance on privatization was not straightforward. Hungary had minimal support for restitutions (re-privatization) and was among the highest in Eastern Europe with regards to resistance to privatization. Despite this, respondents exhibited strong support for selling companies at the highest price offered. A survey conducted in 1991 by Laki indicated that whilst 34% of respondents opposed privatization, a majority of 55-60% were against privatizing their own company. The poll also indicated growing resentment towards foreign investment and the return of lands to previous owners."," The public's view on privatization was not black and white according to the results of the survey. Hungary showed little support for restitutions (re-privatization) and was one of the Eastern European countries with the highest resistance to privatization as a whole. Notwithstanding this, the findings also demonstrated the populace's inclination to sell businesses at the highest price attainable. A report by Laki from the early 1990s suggested that while 34% of respondents opposed privatization, a significant 55-60% opposed privatizing their own company. In addition, respondents showed a strong aversion to foreign investment and the return of land to previous proprietors."," The survey showed that the public's attitude towards privatization was not clear-cut.

" The Hungarian government passed a law in 1988 that allowed the state companies to become joint-stock companies. This allowed the management to gain control of the companies, and the insiders continued to have a significant role in the privatization process in the following decade. The government was unable to sell or retain a company without the approval of insiders, according to Earle and Estrin (1996). However, this power was often abused by management, resulting in scandals and embezzlement. As a result, the public's perception of this form of privatization was negative, leading to a slowdown in the entire privatization process (Srholec, 2001)."," Back in 1988, Hungary passed an act that made it possible for state-owned companies to become joint-stock companies, which was a momentous occasion. This allowed the management to take control of the companies, and the insiders continued to dominate the early stages of the privatization process during the next decade. According to Earle and Estrin (1996), the government could not sell a company to outsiders or retain full ownership without the insiders' consent. However, management often took advantage of their power, resulting in scandals and embezzlement, and this led to the public turning against this form of privatization. As a consequence, the privatization process slowed down significantly, as highlighted by Srholec (2001)."," In Hungary, there was a turning point in the privatization process when the state companies were transformed into joint-stock companies by the 1988 act. This gave the management the power to take over the companies, and during the initial stages of the following decade, insiders continued to play a dominant role in the privatization process. The government was unable to sell a company to external parties or retain full ownership without the approval of insiders, as noted by Earle and Estrin (1996). However, management's power was often misused, leading to scandals and embezzlement, which caused the public to be against this form of privatization. As a result, the privatization process slowed down significantly, as highlighted by Srholec (2001)."
" In 1990, the state Property Fund (SPA) was set up to oversee the privatization process in Ukraine. SPA's responsibilities included supervising the sale of state-owned companies. According to Earle and Estrin (1996), SPA possibly prevented further abuse of power by having to approve all sales. By controlling almost 2,000 state-owned businesses, primarily in industry and agriculture, SPA played a significant role in establishing an institutional environment."," During the year 1990, the state Property Fund (SPA) was established in Ukraine to manage the country's privatization program. SPA was designated as the primary organization for handling privatization and had control over nearly 2,000 state-owned companies, with the majority being in industrial and agricultural sectors. Earle and Estrin (1996) suggest that SPA's role in approving sales may have prevented more significant abuse of the state's resources. SPA's formation in 1990 helped create an institutional environment that facilitated the country's privatization process."," The Ukrainian government established the state Property Fund (SPA) in 1990 to oversee the privatization process in the country.

" The government initiated small-scale privatization concurrently. The introduction of the first program, pre-privatization, began in May 1990, and its primary aim was to prevent uncontrolled privatization, particularly in the retail sector. During the years between 1991 and 1993, an estimated 10,000 small shops and restaurants were sold or leased through auction. Significantly, the majority of the property was given to the employees of the respective shops. The following table presents an overview of the modifications in terms of property ownership."," In the meantime, the government initiated the process of small-scale privatization. The first program, dubbed as pre-privatization, was launched in May 1990 and especially aimed at the retail sector with a mission to halt impulsive privatization. Between 1991 and 1993, approximately 10,000 units, primarily comprising small shops and restaurants, were either sold or leased through auctions. A key aspect of this method of privatization was that the employees of the respective shops received the large share of the property. The subsequent table provides an overview of the changes in property ownership."," In the meantime, the small privatization process was initiated by the government.

" The SPA divested 75% of its ownership until mid-1995, which only accounted for 35% of state property. Certain industries like gas distribution, railways, airlines, telecommunication, banks, and chemical companies were still government-owned. However, the Bokros package changed things. The government needed to reduce the fiscal deficits, so it initiated an intensification of the privatization process, where it planned to sell all state-owned properties, except railways, post office, and national parks. Approximately HUF 1.3 trillion of the state ownership, which was HUF 1.6 trillion, was earmarked for privatization, resulting in foreign investors flooding the country. The government sold properties worth HUF 790 billion, which helped reduce the debt from 86% of GDP in 1995 to 60% in 1998."," The SPA sold 75% of its ownership by mid-1995, equivalent to only 35% of state property.

The government planned to privatize around HUF 1.3 trillion out of its overall state ownership of HUF 1.6 trillion, selling properties directly to foreign investors. This approach generated a considerable inflow of foreign direct investment, ultimately helping the government reduce its debt from 86% of GDP in 1995 to 60% in 1998."," Until mid-1995, SPA had divested 75% of its ownership, which accounted for just 35% of state property.

About HUF 1.3 trillion of the overall state ownership, which was HUF 1.6 trillion, was marked for privatization, with a typical method of direct sales to foreign investors, resulting in a vast inflow of foreign direct investment into Hungary. By the end of 1997, the government sold off properties amounting to HUF 790 billion, and its debt had decreased from 86% of GDP in 1995 to 60% in 1998."
" The diagram illustrates the economic progress in Hungary, showing that like many other central European nations, it experienced a recession during the transformation period. Although the gradual reforms were unable to prevent the economic decline, there was still a noticeable deceleration in growth after 1995.

" The rate of unemployment in Hungary rose during the early stages of transformation, despite implementing a more gradual approach. It peaked at 12%, before experiencing a slow decline. However, in the Czech Republic, unemployment remained at a minimum until 1997 when it grew due to economic and currency crises. By this time, Hungary had already been steadily reducing its unemployment rate. It is worth noting that both countries had low unemployment rates compared to other post-communist countries, with Poland being an example. That being said, there was a significant decrease in employment in Hungary that influenced the data."," Despite adopting a more gradual approach, Hungary still experienced an increase in unemployment during the early period of transformation.

" The current economic literacy tests place a heavy emphasis on theory and largely overlook the actual economy.

" Economic literacy based on facts and impartiality enables students to comprehend the economic environment they live in. This understanding serves as a basis for students to make informed decisions regarding future economic projections and normative guidance regarding the right direction for their economy. Instructors play a dual role in the classroom-they must present students with distinct economic models to indicate how the economy operates and also provide them with insight into the most basic and factual economic variables so that they can properly use these models. This paper highlights only the second role, which is to inform students of factual information about economic variables, which will enable them to make better-informed decisions regarding economic issues. The issue of which models should be taught is not addressed in this text."," Objective economics presents learners with factual data about their economy, allowing them to understand its realities. This foundation provides students with the ability to make educated decisions regarding the future direction of their economy while also giving them the power to make normative assumptions regarding the direction it ought to be heading.

" The claim that those advocating for ""practicing economics"" have a genuine desire to improve student comprehension seems to be plausible. However, it is unclear what this statement really means. Does it require teaching students to think in utility maximization terms? If this is the case, then it implies that utility maximization is not innate and necessitates instruction. Alternatively, does it signify simply introducing students to the most effective models currently available without providing them with a good grasp of authentic economic variables? As discussed earlier, while it is crucial to introduce students to these models, neglecting to provide them with a basic understanding of real financial factors will have future negative consequences. This is akin to assisting students in creating a car but failing to instruct them on fueling the car.

Or does it refer to merely introducing our learners to the best models available and leaving it at that? However, as stated in the opening paragraph, introducing models to students is crucial, but failing to impart a basic understanding of genuine economic variables leads to inevitable shortcomings. It's similar to helping students build a car without informing them that gasoline is required to make the car work.

" The selection of information that falls under the ""economics"" category is critical to defining the scope of the field. This may be why there is now less emphasis on teaching fact-based economics. Although most economists agree that macro topics such as GDP, inflation, unemployment, and GDP per person are essential, some may also include poverty, income distribution, interest rates, or banking. Many lecturers are inclined to teach topics aligned with their interests. However, the pertinent question is whether we provide the students with accurate empirical statistics and reliable information on significant economic matters."," The choice of which facts to incorporate into the realm of economics is crucial in determining the extent of what is considered a part of the field. It is plausible that this might be why fact-based economic instruction is not given the same emphasis as before. Most economists agree that macroeconomic subjects like GDP, inflation, unemployment, and GDP per capita are central issues. However, there are economists who also focus on poverty, changes in income distribution over time, and the importance of interest rates and banking. Still, others might cover other topics, such as how tax systems and social security work. While economists tend to shape their curriculum according to their interests, it is important to consider if students are being provided with detailed and accurate empirical data on major economic issues."," It is important to carefully choose which facts are within the scope of economics as it shapes the definition of the field.

While previous students of the instructor performed significantly better than the remaining participants, their average responses remained significantly off from the true numbers."," Once again, we can analyze the responses based on the formal training of the respondents and obtain some interesting results. Based on the data presented, the study suggests that individuals with more formal training tend to provide more precise responses for the 20% level. However, for the 5% level, there appears to be no significant contrast between people with a ""no high school"" and a ""college"" background (as shown in Table 1). The study also shows that attending high school courses has a detrimental effect on understanding in general. It's worth noting that while the instructor's previous students performed exceptionally well, their average responses were still significantly off from the actual numbers."
" The aim of this paper is to analyze the relationship between economic liberty, foreign direct investment (FDI), and economic development across a sample of 85 countries. Utilizing the generalized method-of-moment system estimator, our findings indicate that FDI does not have an immediate (positive) impact on output growth. Instead, its influence is dependent on the degree of economic freedom present in the host countries. This suggests that nations that foster greater economic freedom receive significant advantages from the presence of multinational corporations (MNCs)."," In this study, we explore the systemic correlation between economic freedom, foreign direct investment (FDI), and economic growth amidst a group of 85 countries.

"The impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on growth has been a highly debated topic in the economic literature. There is increasing interest in this area of research, especially with policymakers' emphasis on attracting more FDI inflows. Many countries, including developing ones, have lifted restrictions on foreign capital flows since the 1980s, leading to a significant increase in global FDI inflows. The growth rate of world FDIs has exceeded not only that of world trade but also GDP over the past few decades (UNCTAD, 2001). Policymakers believe that FDI has several advantages, including productivity gains, transfers of technology, introduction of new processes and management techniques, technical know-how within the local market, employee training, and international production networks. Additionally, FDI is less volatile than other forms of capital, making it less disruptive.","The impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic growth is a much-discussed subject in economics.

Policymakers believe that FDI has several positive effects, such as productivity gains, technology transfers, introduction of new processes and management techniques, technical know-how in the local market, employee training, and international production networks. Also, FDI is considered less volatile than other forms of capital, making it less harmful to economies.","The effect that foreign direct investment (FDI) has on growth has been extensively analyzed in economic literature. Policymakers have been emphasizing attracting more FDI inflows in recent years. Since the early 1980s, many countries, including developing ones, have removed the restrictions on foreign capital flows that had previously been in place. Consequently, global FDI inflows have risen considerably from $57 billion in 1982 to $1271 billion in 2000. Over the past few decades, the growth rate of world FDIs has outpaced the growth rates of both world trade and GDP (UNCTAD, 2001). The common perception is that FDI has several affirmative impacts, including productivity gains, technology transfer, the introduction of new processes and management techniques, technical know-how in the local market, employee training, and international production networks. Additionally, FDI is less volatile than other forms of capital, such as short-term capital, making it less damaging to economies (World Bank, 1999)."
"This article aims to better comprehend the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth through the lens of institutions. Recent literature has suggested that economic freedom plays a crucial role in facilitating FDI spillovers, in which multinational corporations transfer technology and knowledge to host countries. The lack of economic freedom can limit the ability of firms (or countries) to absorb and internalize new knowledge and  technologies, ultimately hindering economic growth. Despite the significance of economic freedom, previous studies have predominantly emphasized its direct impact on economic growth. Therefore, this paper contributes to the literature by examining the role of economic freedom in generating wealth."," The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of the FDI-growth nexus by focusing on institutions. Recent research has emphasized the importance of economic freedom in facilitating FDI spillovers, which is when multinational corporations (MNCs) transfer knowledge and technology to the host country. Limited economic freedom can restrict a firm's (or a country's) capacity to absorb and incorporate novel technologies from MNCs into their economic activities, thus posing roadblocks to economic growth. Although previous studies have highlighted the importance of economic freedom, they have mainly concentrated on its direct influence on economic growth. As a result, this paper fulfills a significant void in the literature by analyzing the role of economic freedom in fostering wealth creation."," The purpose of this paper is to expand our understanding of the relationship between FDI and economic growth by focusing on institutions.

" In this article, we aim to establish a potential link between growth and economic freedom by utilizing the economic freedom index (EF) provided by the Fraser Institute. This index measures institutional quality and provides insight into the characteristics of an environment that promotes prosperity. The index components make us anticipate that countries with higher levels of economic freedom will have greater absorptive capacity and, therefore, gain more benefits from FDI spillovers. Economic professionals generally agree that less regulation would improve economic progress. An open and competitive market offers more opportunities for entrepreneurs to test out new ideas and encourages businesses to participate in risky ventures like FDI-related activities to seek higher returns. However, an extensively regulated market will not function correctly, which leads to poor allocation of resources. For instance, with heavy regulations, FDI-related activities will be affected as businesses require outside sources for funding to adopt new technology.

Generally, the view among economic experts is that less regulation fosters economic progress.

" Factors such as tax incentives, subsidies, and policies that stimulate Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) are designed to encourage FDI because of the expectation that FDI will benefit the recipient country considerably. Multinational Corporations (MNCs) are linked to advanced technologies, patents, trade secrets, brand names, management techniques, and marketing strategies, and they are among the most technologically advanced firms that invest heavily in Research and Development (R&D). Additionally, MNCs recruit a high number of technical and professional employees. FDIs offer immediate access to cutting-edge technology, which can benefit not just those who receive the foreign investment but also other local firms. Foreign direct investments are also known to balance payment deficits, result in job creation, provide training to managers and workers, and increase exports by setting up assembly plants and facilitating local firms to enter international markets."," In order to tap into the significant benefits Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can bring, countries often offer tax incentives, subsidies, and policies that encourage its adoption. The assumption is that Multinational Corporations (MNCs) are associated with advanced technologies, patents, trade secrets, brand names, management techniques, and marketing strategies that will transfer to the recipient countries. Furthermore, MNCs invest heavily in research and development (R&D), making them among the most technologically advanced companies globally, and they hire a sizeable workforce of skilled professionals. By opening the door to FDIs, individual countries gain sudden exposure to cutting-edge technology, which can benefit not only the host nation but also other companies operating there. Foreign direct investment can increase a host nation's capital stock, generating similar growth effects to local investment and also allows for the creation of jobs and management training of employees. In addition, export-oriented FDIs can contribute significantly to exports by establishing assembly plants and facilitating local firms' access to international markets.","Tax incentives, subsidies, and policies aimed at stimulating foreign direct investment (FDI) are used as a means of accessing the significant benefits FDI can bring to receiving countries.

Moreover, MNCs are responsible for recruiting a substantial number of technical and professional employees. By drawing in foreign investment, hosting countries gain immediate exposure to advanced technologies that can benefit not only the recipient nations but also other firms operating within them.

" The importance of skilled labor in working with new technologies has been a topic of discussion in light of their adoption. Borensztein et al. discovered that FDI inflows had a negligible direct effect on growth, but in countries where the labor force's education level was above a certain threshold, FDI positively contributed to growth when combined with education. This interaction effect was not significant for domestic investment, which may indicate the technological differences between FDI and domestic investment. Thus, developed countries with a higher level of human capital are likely to gain more from FDIs than developing countries. Xu's study supported this argument, finding that technology transfer by MNCs from the U.S. contributed to the productivity growth in developed countries but not developing countries. Alfaro et al., on the other hand, disagreed with this idea, stating that human capital did not have a mediating role in FDI inflows. They suggested that developing the financial sector was more important than human capital for FDI spillovers."," The utilization of new technologies necessitates a workforce that is capable of comprehending and working with new technology, according to some arguments.

Domestic investment, in comparison, did not show a significant interaction effect, possibly owing to the difference in technological disparities between FDI and domestic investment. The results suggest that developed countries, with higher human capital, are more likely to benefit from FDIs than developing countries. This concept is further supported by Xu's (2000) findings, stating that technology transfer by U.S. MNCs contributed to productivity growth in developed countries but not in developing ones.

" The relationship between FDI and growth is not entirely clear based on the available empirical evidence. However, the evidence supporting the impact of institutions in the development process is more convincing. North (1990), who is an advocate of economic institutionalism, defines institutions as the humanly created rules and limitations shaping political, economic, and social interaction. Institutions consist of formal guidelines like legal systems, constitutions, and property rights enforced through the proper channels, as well as informal restrictions such as cultural norms, traditions, customs, and values. North also argues that institutions establish the incentive structure of an economy: as the institutional structure sets in, it guides economic progress towards growth. In summary, institutions have an effect on the security of property rights, the level of corruption, the presence of distorted or extractive policies, and thus impact the willingness to invest in human and physical capital, directly influencing economic growth."," While the relationship between FDI and growth cannot be conclusively determined based on the available empirical evidence, the evidence supporting the relevance of institutions in shaping the development process is much stronger. North (1990), widely recognized as an economic institutionalist, defines institutions as the human-made regulations and guidelines that govern political, economic, and social interactions. These institutions comprise formal rules, such as the legal system, constitutions, and property rights that are enforced by relevant agencies, as well as informal constraints, for example, cultural norms, traditions, customs, and codes of conduct. North believes that institutions establish the incentive structure of an economy, and as the institutional structure evolves, it influences economic progress towards growth. To summarize, institutions have a direct impact on the protection of property rights, the prevalence of corrupt practices, the existence of distorted or extractive policies, and ultimately, contribute to the motivation to invest in human and physical capital, resulting in economic growth."," The evidence on the relationship between FDI and growth is mixed, but there is more compelling evidence on the role of institutions in the development process. According to North (1990), an influential economic institutionalist, institutions are the set of humanly structured constraints or regulations that determine how political, economic, and social interactions occur. Formal rules, including constitutions, laws, and property rights enforced by courts and the police, as well as informal constraints, such as cultural norms, taboo, and customs, and agreed-on codes of conduct, are essential features of institutions. North's claim is that these institutions provide the incentive structure of a nation's economy, and as the structure changes, it guides the direction of economic development toward growth. In brief, institutions affect the security of property rights, the prevalence of corrupt acts, the existence of biased or extractive policies, and, consequently, influence the investment choices in human and physical capital, influencing economic growth."
" Several recent studies confirm that institutions are crucial for economic development. Knack and Keefer were pioneers in using property right security indicators, such as ICRG and BERI indices, as proxies for institutional quality in growth research. These institutional indicators included the quality of bureaucracy, property rights, and political stability. Their cross-country analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between these factors and economic performance. Furthermore, Barro argues that secure property rights can enhance growth performance by increasing investment productivity and encouraging investments. Demetriades and Law found that strong institutions are more effective than financial developments in explaining output per capita in low-income countries. Rodrik et al. suggest that institutional quality is more important than geography and trade integration in explaining income differentials. Finally, Acemoglu et al. used the ICRG's protection from expropriation risk index to assess current institutional efficiency."," It has been empirically confirmed by several recent studies that institutions are critical for economic development.

" The correlation between FDI and growth has been explored through empirical studies, but there is still a lack of research when it comes to the spillover effects of FDI in relation to economic freedom. Some argue that countries with more economic freedom will see greater benefits from MNCs, though this has not been backed up by concrete evidence. In order to advance the current understanding of FDI and growth, the next logical step is to gather and analyze more empirical evidence."," Current research on the relationship between FDI and economic growth is limited, particularly when it comes to understanding the impact of economic freedom on FDI spillovers.

" The GMM estimators come in one- and two-step variants, as proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991). One-step estimators utilize weighting matrices that are independent of estimated parameters, while two-step GMM estimators use optimal weighting matrices that rely on consistent estimates of moment conditions' covariance matrices. This results in two-step estimators being more efficient than one-step estimators in the asymptotic limit. However, numerous instruments can lead to biased standard errors and parameter estimates when using the two-step GMM estimator in small samples, as Windmeijer (2005) demonstrated through simulation analysis. Additionally, Bowsher (2002) indicated that numerous instruments may weaken the overidentification test, resulting in an undersized test that fails to reject joint validity at 0.05 or 0.10.

" Based on our empirical analysis using panel data from 85 countries over the 1975-2004 period, three conclusions were drawn. Firstly, FDI has no direct impact on output growth, which is consistent with previous research. Secondly, the study demonstrates the significance of EF as a driver of long-term growth in the countries considered. Support for this finding is also found in earlier studies by de Haan and Sturm (2000) and Sturm and De Haan (2001). Finally, it was determined that the effect of FDI on growth is contingent on the level of EF. Our research indicates that nations that promote economic freedom gain greatly from MNCs' presence, and this is particularly true for developing countries. In such countries, firms can more readily adopt new technologies and other benefits linked with FDI inflows. As a result, certain countries experience greater benefits with acquisition FDI and the presence of foreign multinationals, reflecting the level of their absorptive capacity. It was concluded that EF is an important factor in absorptive capacity, which has so far been underexplored in prior studies."," Our study utilized a panel data of 85 countries covering the period of 1975-2004, and from our empirical analysis, we are able to draw three important conclusions. To start, we find that FDI, as a singular event, has no direct effect on output growth, which is consistent with earlier research. Furthermore, our results also indicate that EF is a critical driver for long-term growth in the countries included in our analysis. Additionally, our findings further strengthen the link between EF and growth, as previously reported in de Haan and Sturm (2000) and Sturm and De Haan (2001). Finally, we conclude that the impact of FDI on growth is reliant on the level of EF in a particular country. We found that countries that prioritize their economic freedom, including developing nations, experience significant benefits from MNCs' presence. This is due to firms being able to easily adopt and incorporate new technologies and other benefits related to FDI inflows. The results also help explain why the benefits gained from acquisition FDI and associated with foreign multinationals' performance advantage differ across countries. The study highlights the crucial role of EF in a nation's absorptive capacity, which has been inadequately examined in prior literature."," Using panel data from 85 countries between 1975 and 2004, our empirical analysis led to three main conclusions.

This correlates with the findings of previous research by de Haan and Sturm (2000) and Sturm and De Haan (2001). Thirdly, it was also found that the impact of FDI on growth is contingent on the level of EF present in the country.

" The freedom of trade across borders offers opportunities for domestic firms to expand their business and export products to international markets. Exporting involves significant expenses including distribution, transport infrastructure, and knowledge of foreign consumer preferences, which may be more affordable for multinational corporations (MNCs) than for domestic firms. Domestic firms can enter into foreign markets by observing and learning from the export processes of foreign firms, either through imitation or collaboration. By taking advantage of these opportunities, domestic firms may lower entry costs and improve their operational efficiency. Access to a greater variety of intermediate goods and capital equipment through international trade is also beneficial for increasing productivity at home. These aspects are consistent with Romer's (1990) view that trade can enhance resource allocation and productivity.","Domestic enterprises can tap into overseas markets and export their products by utilizing the benefits of cross-border trade. Exporting involves a range of costs including the establishment of distribution networks, transport infrastructures, and understanding international consumer preferences - expenses that multinational corporations (MNCs) may be better suited to handle.

" Reducing regulatory restrictions such as those on labor, business, and credit is essential for promoting spillovers in FDI. For instance, by easing regulations on hiring and firing, there will be a greater degree of labor mobility as workers from MNCs bring their knowledge and expertise to domestic firms. Additionally, the level of regulatory constraints on business activities can affect FDI spillovers through market competition. If regulations are low, MNCs are more likely to share their technology with domestic suppliers to maintain competitive prices. Access to external funds is also critical to technology upgrading, and reducing regulatory constraints can help domestic firms acquire new technology more easily. This was emphasized by Alfaro et al. (2004)."," To encourage spillovers in FDI, reducing regulatory constraints such as labor, business, and credit is very important. For example, less regulation on hiring and firing workers in the host country could promote labor mobility between companies. This would allow workers with knowledge and experience gained from working at MNCs to transfer that knowledge to domestic firms. Moreover, the level of regulations on the business activities of MNCs could have an impact on FDI spillovers. If the competition in a particular industry is high due to fewer regulations, MNCs could be more willing to transfer technology to their domestic suppliers to obtain intermediate goods at competitive prices. Access to external funds is also critical for technology upgrading, and reducing regulatory restrictions can increase the chances for domestic firms to acquire new technology. Alfaro et al.

The level of regulatory constraints on business activities can also affect FDI spillovers through the market competition. MNCs can be more willing to transfer their technology to domestic suppliers to secure intermediate goods at a competitive price if the level of competition is high (i.e., few regulations). The success of domestic firms in acquiring new technology depends on access to external funds, which can be enhanced by reducing regulatory constraints. Alfaro et al. (2004) highlighted the importance of financial markets in spillovers of FDI."
" Policymakers must consider the cost of policies intended to lure foreign investment in contrast to policies aimed at enhancing the level of economic freedom. Strategies to attract foreign investment should be subordinate to policies that prioritize economic freedom because they are likely to yield more significant benefits. Countries that do not implement these strategies may fall behind in the competition. Policymakers need to enact transparent policies that are clear to potential investors before considering other means of attracting greater foreign investment. However, implementing these changes could be a challenging process that necessitates a long-term commitment. Despite the fact that these reforms may encounter short-term political opposition in some countries, the long-term economic advantages could be enormous."," To ensure economic growth, policymakers must consider the cost-effectiveness of policies that promote foreign direct investment against those that prioritize increasing economic freedom. Rather than prioritizing policies that attract FDI, policymakers should concentrate on policies that enhance economic freedom since they tend to produce better outcomes. Countries that do not follow suit risk getting left behind in the competition. Policymakers must create clear and transparent policies to attract potential investors before resorting to other means of attracting high levels of foreign investment. However, making these reforms can be a tough and demanding task that requires a long-term commitment. In some nations, they may encounter significant political resistance in the short term, but the long-term economic advantages may be significant."," Policymakers should evaluate the cost of promoting foreign investment in contrast to enhancing economic freedom. Policies that enhance economic freedom should be prioritized over strategies aimed at attracting FDI since they tend to produce better outcomes. Countries that fail to implement such policies risk losing their competitive edge. Policymakers should establish clear, comprehensible policies to attract potential investors rather than relying on other incentives to attract high levels of foreign investment. Nevertheless, enacting these reforms can be a difficult process that requires a long-term commitment. These initiatives may encounter significant political resistance in the short term in some countries, but the scope of long-term economic benefits from these measures should not be overlooked."
" It is essential to acknowledge certain limitations, despite the findings' importance. Our main specification's interaction term compels the impact of FDI on growth to either rise or decline consistently with the level of EF. Nevertheless, it is possible that FDI may require a specific level of EF before it can have an effect on host countries. Only countries with high absorptive capacity can benefit from foreign capital, as countries with low absorptive capacity may not derive much or any benefit from FDI. As a result, there is a need for a more adaptable specification to accommodate diverse types of interactions between FDI, output growth, and economic freedom. One feasible solution is to use a regression model dependent on the threshold effects concept to capture the presence of contingency effects. We aim to examine this in future research."," Despite the important findings, there are some caveats that we need to consider. The interaction term in our main specification forces the impact of FDI on growth to either increase or decrease monotonously with the level of EF. However, it's possible that FDI needs a specific level of EF before it can have any impact on host countries. This means that only countries with greater absorptive capacity, as noted by World Bank (2001) and others, are likely to benefit from foreign capital. Conversely, the benefits of FDI are reduced, or even non-existent, in countries with low absorptive capacity. This highlights the necessity for a more flexible specification to accommodate different forms of interactions between FDI, output growth, and economic freedom. One solution we could opt for is to use a regression model based on threshold effects to capture the possibility of contingency effects, as suggested by Girma (2005), among others. We have left this option open for further research."," It's essential to recognize specific limitations, despite the significance of the findings. The interaction term in our primary specification coerces the impact of FDI on growth to either increase or decrease consistently with the degree of EF. However, FDI may require a certain level of EF before having any influence on host countries. Moreover, as emphasized by the World Bank (2001) and other researchers, countries with higher absorptive capacity are better suited to benefit from foreign capital. In contrast, FDI's benefits might be significantly reduced, or even non-existent, in nations with low absorptive capacity. This stresses the need for a more flexible specification that can account for diverse kinds of interactions between FDI, output growth, and economic freedom. To capture the presence of contingency effects, we may consider using a regression model based on the concept of threshold effects, as explored by Girma (2005) and others. We have left this avenue open for future research."
