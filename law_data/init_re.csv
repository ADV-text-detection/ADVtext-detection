47,1,"This research evaluates the economic knowledge of students who undergo structured economic education during their senior year of high school. We selected our sample from seven high schools within two school districts in Orange County, California. All students were enrolled in the mandatory, semester-long economics course, a requirement for graduation. Our chief measure of performance is the Test of Economic Literacy (TEL). The results indicate that students' initial understanding of economics is inadequate. However, their TEL scores improved by an average of 12.3 percentage points, after one semester of formal economics instruction, as revealed by a pretest-post-test design.",0
47,2,"It is becoming more common for the media to discuss the importance of economic and financial literacy, indicating that policymakers and educators recognize its significance for children, teenagers, and young adults. There have been two national summits on economic and financial literacy and a substantial amount of academic literature highlights the importance of economics education in high school, with continued research exploring issues surrounding economics teaching and learning at both the high school and college levels.",0
47,3,"Our investigation in Orange County, California revealed the economic literacy of high school students. In 1985, California included one semester of economics in high school graduation requirements. This course is taken in the senior year and covers micro and macroeconomic analyses. California is one of the 17 states that mandate formal principles of economics instruction at the secondary level. However, no empirical study has focused on the effectiveness of formal economics instruction in improving economic literacy in California high school students. Our study aims to address this gap.",0
47,4,"Our research has implications for two major policy concerns. The first pertains to the effectiveness of high school economics education in fostering economic literacy. As stated in the following discussion, evidence from a national level indicates that high school economics classes have a positive impact on students¡¯ performances on standardized economics tests. By adopting a research design that employs a single county, single state approach, and includes a comprehensive set of control variables derived from our survey and school records, we refine the focus on this issue. The second policy concern centers on the influence of gender and ethnicity/race on economic literacy. Previous studies, predominantly at the national level, reveal significant gender differences in economic knowledge prior to taking an economics course, but are inconclusive regarding gender-related effects on economics learning. Although research on the impact of ethnicity and race on economic knowledge is limited, studies suggest that differences do exist. Using our research design, we address both ethnicity and gender effects on economic literacy before and after students take high school economics.",0
47,5,"Due to the complexity of factors affecting student achievement in economics, our research focuses on one state and one county to investigate more effectively. Differences in funding and instructional emphasis on economics vary greatly between states and counties, and our design mitigates these variations and enables us to better understand the impact of student characteristics on achievement.",0
47,6,"Despite the practical limitations imposed on our research design discussed in the Study Methodology, Data, and Characteristics of the Sample section, the demographics of Orange County are still significant to this study. According to the California Department of Education (www.cde.ca.gov) for 2003-2004, Orange County had the second largest grade 12 enrollments in the state, making up more than 8 percent of all high school seniors in California. Additionally, Orange County stands out as one of the most diverse populations in the state with higher percentages of Asian and Hispanic students enrolled in 12th grade than the corresponding percentages for the state.",0
47,7,"Based on evidence from various studies, it is more effective to have students take an economics course to improve their economic literacy compared to infusing economic content in the K-12 curriculum. Students who were enrolled in economics courses performed better on the Test of Economic Literacy compared to those who were enrolled in social studies classes with no economic content or some economic content. Moreover, studies suggest that nationwide, students who took an economics course obtained higher scores on the TEL multiple choice examination. Controlling for selection bias further supports the positive effect of economics courses on post-test performance. (Mask used: Paraphrase)",0
47,8,"According to studies in the literature, there have been investigations into discrepancies in economic literacy between genders. Siegfried's [1979] article is often referenced, in which he discusses the gender gap in students' performance and notes that males tend to have a slight advantage in understanding economics at a specific time. Recent works have confirmed this gender gap, with high school students' point-in-time measures of economic knowledge generally favoring males. Studies by Watts [1987], Heath [1989], Walstad and Soper [1989], Evans [1992], and Walstad and Robson [1997] all support this finding.",0
47,9,"There is limited proof that women are inferior in learning economics when factors affecting economic comprehension and knowledge accumulation are accounted for, according to Siegfried. When using a pretest-posttest design to gauge improvements in economic knowledge, the initial disadvantage of female students does not increase over time, indicating that both genders learn at comparable rates. This finding is also observed in more recent research by Jackstadt and Grootaert, Watts, and Allgood and Walstad. Although Walstad and Soper discovered that there are significant differences in learning rates that favor males, this outcome was replicated in a subsequent study by Becker and Walstad.",0
47,10,"The impact of race and ethnicity on test scores has received limited attention in academic research. However, some studies have examined this issue. Evans [1992] and Harris and Kerby [1997] have both analyzed the impact of race and ethnicity on test scores. Evans suggests that black students tend to score lower than white students, while Hispanics perform at a similar level to whites. In contrast, Harris and Kerby's study found that black students are at a significant disadvantage compared to white students, and both Hispanics and Filipinos tend to have lower test scores than whites. On the other hand, Asian students tend to score higher than white students, but the difference is not statistically significant. Additionally, Walstad and Soper [1989] found that black students tend to perform worse on the TEL compared to other students. In addition, the US Department of Education¡¯s National Center for Education Statistics conducted a national assessment of economic literacy for grade 12 students in 2007, revealing that a greater percentage of blacks and Hispanics scored below the basic level compared to whites.",0
47,11,"The county of Orange, California has a total of 15 school districts that are overseen by a county superintendent. We reached out to the county superintendent¡¯s office to acquire a comprehensive list of high schools in Orange County and the contact details for each district¡¯s superintendent. The assistant superintendent for the county wrote a letter to the superintendents of the districts, showing their support for our project.",0
47,12,"We appealed multiple times to the superintendents of the districts to gain their support for the project. Eventually, two significant school districts, Fullerton and San Juan Capistrano, agreed to collaborate with us. Seven schools from these districts participated in the research, with a total of 1,343 students enrolled in the mandatory economics courses for the fall semester of 2005. The sampling limitations found in previous studies on economic education at the pre-college and college level prevail, regardless of the sample size or financial resources available to the researchers [e.g., Walstad and Soper 1988, p. 28; 1989, p. 24]. It's vital to note that the reported 1,343 figure represents the quantity of students enrolled in the classes surveyed as of the census date. As we'll explain later, the actual number of students who attended the classes and submitted complete data was lower.",0
47,13,"To evaluate students' initial economics knowledge and subsequent learning, we use the TEL as our key performance measures. The TEL is a standardized test, which assesses pre-college economic literacy and was developed by the National Council on Economic Education. It consists of 40 multiple choice questions on basic core, micro, macro, and international economics concepts. We administer the test to our students at the beginning of the semester as a pretest and again in the last week of the course as a post-test.",0
47,14,"We required information on students¡¯ characteristics to evaluate their performance on the TEL examination. This was obtained from a student questionnaire we designed along with official records of the school, entailing details of their demographics, family background, and academic performance. The questionnaire contained information on their race, ethnicity, gender, primary language, working hours outside of school, study hours, and parents¡¯ educational background. GPA records (excluding physical education) were obtained from official school records. Some schools also provided standardized mathematics and reading scores. The pretest was given to students prior to the commencement of their economics course, with no prior formal training in economics. Our survey questionnaire was administered in the first fortnight of classes.",0
47,15,"Table 1 displays the descriptive statistics from the multiple regression analysis of pretest and post-test scores presented in the Analysis of Test Scores section. The sample size used for the analysis was 514 students who provided complete information on test scores and survey responses. The sample size decreased due to students who did not attend the class, students who refused to answer individual questions, or those who were absent on the day of the pretest, post-test, or survey administration.",0
47,16,"The initial column of Table 1 displays demographic, academic and work performance, and background information of students, including pretest and post-test TEL scores. The second column of the table presents frequency distributions for categorical variables and means and standard deviations for continuous variables. Our sample data show that females constitute a larger percentage compared to males (53.9 percent vs. 46.1 percent). Additionally, approximately 70 percent of the student population is white, 17.7 percent Hispanic, and 5.3 percent Asian. Approximately 4 percent of students report a language other than English for reading, writing, and speaking, and 9 percent are foreign-born. Furthermore, 10.6 percent of students speak languages other than English at home. Our data also indicate that more fathers have a college education compared to mothers, and 73 percent of the students in our sample live with both their mothers and fathers mostly.",0
47,17,"Table 1's final section presents an overview of students' attributes, such as academic performance, test scores, and work effort. The average academic GPA is 3.02, and 65.4% of students took at least one advanced placement or honors class. Moreover, 21.2% of students were part of an economics class taught at the advanced placement level. The average scores for mathematics and reading are 246 and 230, respectively, out of a possible 300. On average, students dedicated a bit under 9 hours weekly to studies and around 10.4 hours weekly to paid work. Finally, the students' TEL scores showed an increase from 52.9% accuracy on the pretest to 65.2% accuracy on the post-test.",0
47,18,"The post-test regression includes both pretest scores and student characteristics that determine pretest scores. Therefore, the coefficients for student characteristics in the post-test regression show the effects of these characteristics on post-test scores, after accounting for their impact on pretest scores. The aim is to understand how these variables influence the value-added from economics instruction.",0
47,19,"Table 2 displays data regarding pretest scores and the changes made in test scores. The information is organized based on categories such as race and ethnicity, gender, and academic performance. The first two rows of data indicate a detailed account of pretest scores and the difference in scores before and after the test. However, the data for African-American students is not included due to a limited number of observations. The third and fourth, and fifth and sixth rows exhibit the same sort of data segregated by gender and whether students have taken honors or advanced placement classes. The probability values for univariate tests of significance in each case are shown within the table.",0
47,20,"Table 2 displays that there are significant gender differences in pretest scores, albeit minor. On average, male students exceed female students by approximately 3.5 percentage points. According to Walstad and Rebeck [2001b], there exists a gender gap of 4 percentage points in favor of male students who have not had formal economic education. Additionally, students who have taken at least one advanced placement or honors class have performed better on the TEL than those who haven't. Similar findings have been reported by Evans [1992] and Walstad and Rebeck [2001a, b].",0
47,21,"In Column 1 of Table 3, it is observed that the pretest scores of Hispanic and Asian students are significantly lower than those of white students. However, multiple regression analysis shows a decrease in the white-Hispanic gap in scores, which suggests that the performance gap can be partly explained by family background, performance, and work effort characteristics. The negative effect on African American students is significant, but caution is advised when interpreting the result for Asian and African American students due to small sample sizes. This is consistent with the findings reported in Table 2.",0
47,22,"The results presented in Table 3 reveal contrasting gender effects. According to Column 1, males have a 6.4 percentage point advantage, which is 83 percent more significant than the gender difference shown in Table 2. This variation can be attributed to males performing below females in academic performance measures, but managing to score better than females on the TEL. Consequently, taking academic performance factors into account amplifies the disparity between male and female test scores.",0
47,23,"Further findings suggest that individuals who identify English as their primary language for writing and speaking are likely to achieve scores approximately 5 percentage points higher on the pretest compared to those who do not. Similar trends are observed for students who live with both parents, with an expected score increase of around 3 percentage points. Unsurprisingly, academic performance is positively associated with pretest success, with every one-point increase in academic GPA linked to approx. 9.12 percentage point increase in pretest scores. Furthermore, students enrolled in advanced placement economics classes are likely to score almost 4 percentage points higher on the pretest. Notably, the variable controlling for whether students have ever taken AP or honors classes is unimportant in the pretest regressions.",0
47,24,"Adding math and reading scores to the pretest regression analysis (Table 3, Column 2) has minimal effect on the ethnic and gender effects previously reported in Column 1. A reading score increase of ten points results in a slightly over 4% increase in pretest scores. By factoring in math and reading scores, the impact of academic GPA lessens from 9.12 percentage points to 7.42 percentage points. However, the impact of currently being enrolled in advanced placement economics increases from 3.88 percentage points to 5.78 percentage points.",0
47,25,"Our study supports previous research regarding factors that influence a student's economic knowledge in high school. As discussed in the literature review, multiple studies have found significant differences by gender, with males performing better than females. Our gender effects are even larger than those reported in previous studies, except for one by Heath. Similarly, academic ability, as measured by GPA or AP course enrollment, has been found to be a significant predictor of economic knowledge. Other studies have also shown that variables such as grade level, GPA, and holding a part-time job have a significant impact on students' scores. Additionally, ethnicity has been found to be a factor, with Hispanics and Filipinos scoring significantly lower than whites on multiple choice exams. Our study, focused on a single county, suggests even larger ethnicity and gender differences than those reported in previous studies, although the results for Hispanic students may be influenced by factors specific to Orange County.",0
47,26,"The initial knowledge of economics among high school students in the sample is not strong. Based on descriptive statistics, white students had the highest pretest TEL scores (55.5%), followed by Asians (48.9%) and Hispanics (44.1%), while males performed better than females by about 3.5 percentage points (54.8% and 51.3%, respectively). Ethnicity and gender were significant determinants of pretest scores, with Hispanic students showing a reduced gap with whites in pretest scores when academic performance and family background characteristics were controlled.",0
47,27,"The pretest score gender differences are interesting as they show that although males have a slight advantage in initial economic literacy, the gap widens when accounting for academic performance factors. Females appear to perform worse in economics compared to other subjects, potentially suggesting that introducing economic reasoning to young girls at a younger age may improve their performance. Additionally, academic performance, including GPA and standardized mathematics and reading scores, significantly influences pretest scores.",0
47,28,"The evidence suggests that teacher quality is a crucial factor in determining students' learning. The teacher-specific effects have been found to be largely significant, implying that good teachers play a vital role in enhancing students' test scores. Although there may be some common factors among students in the same classroom that lead to peer effects, the impact of teacher quality on changes in students' performance cannot be overlooked.",0
47,29,"The results suggest that effective policy intervention should target specific ethnicities and genders. Improving economic literacy for Hispanics requires addressing factors that impact their overall academic performance compared to whites. This can be achieved via better learning opportunities in all subjects, including economics, at a younger age. The discrepancy between white and Hispanic pretest scores indicates earlier exposure to economic concepts may differ due to income and community characteristics. Additionally, female students have less economic knowledge than their male counterparts, even with similar overall academic performance.",0
47,30,"It seems that more needs to be done to cultivate basic economic knowledge among students throughout the K-11 curriculum, based on our analysis of 12th graders' initial knowledge of economics, albeit limited to a specific region. Although the California History/Social Science Standards have incorporated an Economics Strand into the K-12 program since 1998, necessitating the inclusion of fundamental economic principles and ways of thinking over an 11-year period before completing a one-semester economics course during high school, this ""infusion"" requirement does not seem to have resulted in a strong grasp of economic literacy among young Californians entering 12th grade. Nevertheless, we discovered that 12th-grade formal economic instruction does enhance students' economic literacy.",0
48,1,"Classical economists gave great importance to the accumulation of capital and growth. This focus on growth and accumulation can be traced back to Adam Smith's book, The Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Many scholars have noted that Smith's work provided a formal description of economic development, in which various economic forces interacted and drove the commercial economy forward in a dynamic process.",0
48,2,"In terms of the matters related to economic evolution, there is more to the story. To comprehend it comprehensively, we require to consider the study of history as well. According to Smith, studying history is crucial to understanding mankind and society. History serves as a means to create a stable system of social science. Additionally, Smith describes the historical advancement of society from feudalism to the emergence of contemporary European states in Book III of the Wealth of Nations.",0
48,3,"In his essay on the history of astronomy, Smith highlights that science aims to identify the mechanisms that contribute to regularities between events and phenomena. Smith emphasizes that the goal of scientists is to discover the ""connecting principles of nature"" or the ""invisible chains that bind together all these disjointed objects."" Similarly, moral philosophy is seen in the Wealth of Nations as a ""science that investigates and explains these connecting principles."" Smith dedicated himself to uncovering the ""chains and mechanisms"" or ""connecting principles"" that could be used to make inferences about social events. As a result, Smith's moral philosophy, which covers natural theology, ethics, jurisprudence, and economics, is often regarded as a social science system today.",0
48,4,"Smith's historical account has been interpreted by some as a nomothetic approach to history, rather than an idiographic one. This means that history is viewed as less of a narrative description of past events and more of a systematic examination of main issues, starting from a theoretical framework. Smith's historical discourse began with the system and used historical evidence to support his theory, rather than starting with the facts and forming a theory from them.",0
48,5,Scholars studying Smith found it intriguing that he claimed in 1776 that the true progression of economic growth in Europe was completely reversed. This spurred Smith to dedicate chapters two through four of Book III to exploring the reasons behind this divergence. Some individuals have since contended that Smith could not reconcile his theoretical perspective on history with the facts of the past.,0
48,6,"For the current intention, it is crucial to note that the theoretical progression described in the initial chapter of Book III relies on an economic theoretical model that assumes a set of institutional, legal, and political factors as steadfast.",0
48,7,"Smith's theoretical history of economic progress may have an extended dimension that involves the integration of politico-economic modeling alongside economic modeling. This would involve examining the principles and structures of legal rules and incentives at the level of the polity and their relationship with economic forces. Smith attempts to do this in much of Book III and IV of the Wealth of Nations, yet the presentation of this theoretical history of economic change may not be immediately apparent.",0
48,8,"Smith believed that political economy is not solely concerned with economics but is also influenced by political activities. He considered it as a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator, which may be referred to as a theory of the state. Moreover, he believed that natural jurisprudence, which is a theory of the general principles that should underpin the laws of nations, could be considered as a precursor to the theory of the state.",0
48,9,"Smith's politico-economic model in economic history suggests that his theories of the state and positive economics serve as sub-theories. According to Smith's historical account of Europe's progress, the model shows that the interaction between the polity and the economy is affected by governmental actions and legal institutions created by public policy, leading to either favorable or unfavorable economic performance.",0
48,10,"Smith acknowledged that various factors play a significant role in the growth and decline of wealth in the actual historical process. He emphasized that defense, climate, culture, terrain, and luck are some of the forces that affect economic performance and social transformation.",0
48,11,"According to Smith's 1776 book, the principle of self-love, known as the desire to improve one's circumstances, is an innate, lifelong drive. Smith posits that this drive is what propels individuals to save and as a result, contributes to capital accumulation at the macro level, ultimately leading to increased national income and higher employment.",0
48,12,"Smith's economic history includes an examination of institutional elements, like political regulations, property rights, and contracts, which are regulated by the state. These human institutions serve as formal limits to daily life and serve as a critical facilitator of human interaction. If structured properly, a polity type and property rights structure can allow individuals to confidently engage in economic activities, allowing for a more efficient use of resources.",0
48,13,"""Starting from Book III, Chapter 2 of the Wealth of Nations, Smith chronicles the growth of wealth and the shift to the contemporary economy, which primarily took place in Europe following the decline of the Roman Empire. According to Smith, this time period marked an agricultural stage. Thus, Smith's depiction of history centers around the development of agriculture.""",0
49,1,"The study examines the extent to which institutional environment contributes to global variations in economic growth and development by using a novel approach based on the institutions-augmented Solow model. Regression equations are employed to estimate the model empirically, and data from 180 countries during the 1993-2012 period is used for the analysis. Results show that higher quality institutional environments significantly influence economic development across all five institutional indicators, namely two indices of economic freedom, the governance indicator, the democracy index, and the EBRD transition indicator for post-socialist countries. The study concludes that differences in human and physical capital and institutional environment account for about 70-75% of global disparities in economic development. Nonetheless, the institutions-augmented Solow model performs relatively poorly in explaining differences in economic growth rates. Only the index of economic freedom has a statistically significant impact on economic growth.",0
49,2,"There are multiple influences that impact economic growth and development, encompassing theoretical and empirical perspectives. By categorizing these factors, it can be concluded that they are either demand-side or supply-side determinants. The demand-side group includes aggregate demand components like investment expenditures, government spending on goods and services, and net exports (while consumption is excluded due to its dependence on output). Whereas, the supply-side group encompasses variables like physical capital, human capital, labor, and technology that affect potential output. Both of these categories can be further subcategorized as per their type, including multiple types of investments or government spending, or capital. As these factors directly transform inputs or expenditures into output, they are termed as direct determinants.",0
49,3,Economic growth and development rely not only on direct determinants but also on deep factors of production. These deep determinants impact the direct determinants and ultimately affect the macroeconomic performance. Institutions are considered deep determinants as they facilitate interactions between measurable inputs and output.,0
49,4,"The significance of institutions in driving economic growth and development is vast. Yet, determining which institutions play the most pivotal role in economic growth and measuring them quantitatively for empirical studies poses two main questions. Firstly, identifying the most vital growth-contributing institutions and secondly, quantifying institutions to include in empirical evaluations. The complexities of addressing these inquiries indicate that there is much scope for theoretical and empirical research that investigates the link between institutions and economic growth.",0
49,5,"The term 'institution' has a vast scope, with countless variables representing various types of institutions. Sulejewicz's study from 2009 illustrates this concept with numerous institutional categories. Meanwhile, Persson defines institutions as the mechanisms of the 'game,' sustained by legal and social norms or dominance by powerful groups. Informal institutions, such as trust and loyalty, exist alongside more formalized institutions like limited liability corporations which necessitate legal input. Markets require multiple types of institutions, from property rights to economic stabilization measures, social insurance, and strategies for conflict management, including the rule of law, high-quality judicial systems, representative political bodies, free elections, independent labor unions, social partnerships, and minority group representation. Rodrik's 2007 work identifies these fundamental institutions as essential for functioning markets.",0
49,6,"The research hypotheses and objectives of the paper encompass various aspects. Firstly, the paper seeks to expand the neoclassical growth model by incorporating institutions. Secondly, it aims to evaluate the impact of institutions on the economic development of countries across the globe through empirical analysis. Thirdly, the paper investigates the empirical impact of institutions on the global level of economic growth. Lastly, the paper intends to estimate the production function on the basis of the aforementioned results.",0
49,7,"It is not feasible to analyze all possible types of institutions in one empirical study, so constraints must be introduced regarding the number and type of institutional indicators. The study focuses on four indices reflecting different aspects of the institutional environment: economic freedom, governance, democracy, and transition. GDP per capita at PPP measures economic development, while its growth rate reflects economic growth. The study covers 180 countries, but models may be estimated based on a smaller number of countries depending on data availability.",0
49,8,"The article consists of five sections. The second one, situated after the introduction, outlines the methodology by briefly explaining the Mankiw-Romer-Weil model as well as the institutions-augmented Solow model, and by examining the literature, describing other chosen studies on the connection between institutions and growth. Subsequently, the next section depicts the utilized data. After that, the findings of the investigation are demonstrated and talked about. Lastly, the conclusion is provided.",0
49,9,"We will be comparing the Solow model, which has been expanded to include human capital, known as the Mankiw-Romer-Weil (MRW) model, with our own model, the institutions-augmented Solow model. We will only be presenting the most crucial assumptions and implications in this section to maintain brevity. Pr¨®chniak [2013] delves deeper into some of the topics.",0
49,10,"According to the Solow model augmented with institutions, Equation (21) indicates that economic growth is influenced by both institutions and standard factors. Economic growth is more rapid with better institutions. By using linear regression to estimate Equation (21), we can empirically verify the impact of institutions on economic growth, subject to certain assumptions regarding the regression model and estimation methods. Bia?owolski, Kuszewski, and Witkowski [2010] assume that all macroeconomic relationships are linear.",0
49,11,"There are different ways of finding the variables that affect economic growth besides the estimation of the regression equation. One alternative method is growth accounting, which calculates the impact of measurable factor inputs and technology on economic growth. The Solow residual represents the unexplained part of growth that is attributed to technical progress or total factor productivity. However, we cannot distinguish the contribution of institutions from other factors using this method. Estimating the regression equation and growth accounting require different econometric methodologies, and therefore cannot be directly compared. If interested, see Rapacki and Pr¨®chniak [2006] for studies using the growth accounting exercise.",0
49,12,"It is well documented in literature that there is no singular approach to measuring institutions, hence a plethora of empirical studies have been conducted to assess their impact on economic growth or development. The sheer volume of these studies makes it unfeasible to cover even a small proportion in a single paper. Therefore, we present a concise overview of selected empirical studies in Table 1. These studies evaluate the influence of institutional environment on macroeconomic performance using a range of indicators including economic freedom, level of democracy, and political stability.",0
49,13,"The methods of analysis in the literature review are diverse and include various theoretical models, institutional indicators, samples of countries and time periods, and econometric modeling. While some clear tendencies have been observed, such as the positive impact of economic freedom on economic growth, some questions remain unanswered, such as whether the impact of institutions on growth is linear or nonlinear. This leaves much room for further empirical studies. Our paper aims to test the suitability of the institutions-augmented Solow model in explaining differences in economic growth rates and levels of development, and use these findings to estimate the macroeconomic production function.",0
49,14,We will examine the institutions-augmented Solow model in this section to demonstrate how it explains the distinctions in economic development and growth across various countries. The investigation starts by identifying the factors that determine economic development before switching to examine the factors accountable for economic growth.,0
49,15,"Based on Table 2 data, the institutions-augmented Solow model performs exceptionally well in explaining global variations in income levels. Regardless of the institutional indicator used, all regression equations exhibit high R-squares, and estimated coefficients align with theoretical analysis and our expectations. For example, variant A indicates that differences in physical capital accumulation, human capital accumulation, population growth, and economic freedom explained about 75% of global differences in economic development. All explanatory variables were statistically significant except for population growth, which had a positive sign contrary to theory. If the Fraser Institute's index of economic freedom was used as the institutional indicator, the results were similar, with human capital and institutions remaining significant, but physical capital becoming insignificant. Variant C, where the institutional variable was the world governance indicator compiled by the World Bank, yielded similar results to variant B, except for physical capital, which was completely insignificant.",0
49,16,"Based on theoretical analysis, there is a negative relationship between the rate of economic growth and the initial GDP per capita level, which indicates convergence. As countries experience a catching-up effect, income disparities between them decrease. Furthermore, physical capital and human capital accumulation, as well as institutional factors, have a positive impact on the rate of economic growth. On the other hand, population growth has a rather negative relationship with output dynamics.",0
49,17,"The Solow model, extended for institutional variables, is more effective in explaining worldwide differences in economic development than differences in economic growth rates. This is because institutional factors, investment rates, and human capital accumulation are related to the supply side of the economy, influencing potential output significantly. Additionally, economic growth rates are influenced by many demand-side factors and other forces, which do not accurately reflect fluctuations in potential output. Institutional factors have long-term effects on economic development, while economic growth rates do not reveal long-term tendencies. Therefore, the institutions-augmented Solow model can better explain differences in economic development than rates of economic growth.",0
49,18,"When analyzing the outcomes, it is assumed that the past explanatory variables affect the current level of economic development. However, some macroeconomic correlations have mutual causation, which is due to the endogenous nature of particular variables. For instance, being wealthy enables a country to have better prospects for saving, investing in human capital, and favorable regulations and institutions. Nevertheless, to examine endogeneity, more advanced econometric techniques are necessary and could be explored in future studies.",0
49,19,"The formulas above present somewhat conflicting results. The first formula highlights the significant role of human capital in economic development, while the latter places greater importance on physical capital accumulation. This could be because the former formula was derived from the determinants of economic development, where human capital proves more influential. Economic well-being stems from long-term economic growth, which largely depends on human capital accumulation from the past few decades. Consequently, countries with surplus human capital tend to achieve higher levels of economic development.",0
49,20,"In medium-term economic growth, physical capital appears to be more crucial. Investing in physical capital results in rapid economic growth, whilst the accumulation of human capital takes more time to have an impact. Therefore, physical capital is deemed to be a more significant variable in the process of economic growth. This perspective is shared by some economic growth models, such as the Uzawa-Lucas model, which suggests that a weaker economy's pace of development primarily depends on whether the nation is scarce in physical or human capital.",0
49,21,"Institutions are a crucial factor in determining GDP, irrespective of the model employed. On average, the institutional elasticity of output is either 0.55 or 1.05, implying the significance of institutions in determining output. Moreover, most of the individual models also substantiate this conclusion.",0
50,1,"The study focused on examining the idea of an economic man as a key figure in economic ethics by exploring the behavior of individuals in economic settings. We considered traditional economic theories and drew inspiration from M. Weber¡¯s and S. N. Bulgakov¡¯s depiction of the Christian economic man. Instead of exploring various approaches to economic ethics, we utilized Weber and Bulgakov¡¯s definition to scrutinize the hypothesis of a rational economic man, and debated L. von Mises¡¯s and A. Sen¡¯s positions on the freedom and character of an economic man. One of the essential issues that need to be studied among scholars interested in economic ethics and business ethics is how to reconcile the self-interest and altruistic tendencies that often coexist in an economic man, with the goal of creating more altruistic economic agents.",0
50,2,"In the late 19th century, China faced a challenge from the capitalist powers of Europe and America and the influence of Western civilization. China first encountered the West's military might in the form of ships and guns, which prompted a realization of the advantages of laws and institutions in Western capitalist countries. As a result, Neo-Confucianism reinvented the traditional Confucian concept of 'external enrichment' to harmoniously blend Confucianism, capitalism, and democracy. Similarly, when Peter the Great westernized Russia, the amalgamation of Russian and Western civilizations was an important issue. As Russia enters the 21st century with a 'westernized' capitalist market economy, the issues of reconciling Western civilization with the inherent Russian culture and promoting a mature and incorruptible democracy are yet to be fully addressed. This topic is worthy of academic attention.",0
50,3,"In the 1950s, various researchers such as Pye (1982), Mead (2001), Almond and Verba (1963), Lipset (2001), McClelland (1987), among others, made significant contributions to research techniques used at that time. From the 1970s to the 1980s, several Asian countries came under the influence of Confucian culture, primarily after the economic success of the Four Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan). Thus, scholars like Landes (1998), Fukuyama (1995), Huntington (1993), Porter (1990), Radelet and Sachs (1998), based their studies in Confucian ethics and culture's part in economic growth. Consequently, since the 1990s, there have been many studies on the interaction between culture and economic/political development. Although Confucian ethics are a significant foundation of Chinese culture, the Eastern Orthodox Church's religious culture and ethics have heavily influenced Russian culture. Despite this, there have been few studies examining the Russian Orthodox ethics culture's impact and interaction with economic development. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the operation of Russian-style capitalism, driven by the Eastern Orthodox Church's culture rooted in ethical beliefs.",0
50,4,"This study aims to employ Amartya Sen's economic ethics theory to develop Russia's capitalist market economic ethics by comparing the economic ethics of Protestantism and the Eastern Orthodox Church. The Russian Orthodox Church's culture and tradition have significantly influenced the country's development, as demonstrated in A. Leroy-Beaulieu's 'The Empire of the Tsars and the Russians' and J. F. Hecker's 'Religion under the Soviets,' where Russians are referred to as 'apostles of God' and 'those who yearn for God.'",0
50,5,"The primary objective of this study is to explore the economic system of the Russian capitalist market along with the ethical principles that the Eastern Orthodox Church follows in business management. Additionally, it extends Max Weber's ethical musings on the capitalist economic system in his famous work ""The Protestant Ethics and the Spirit of Capitalism."" Besides, it examines how the religious and cultural background affects economic development and business operations.",0
50,6,"Bulgakov's 'Eastern Orthodox Church-The Orthodox Dogma' discusses the connection between religions and economic activities in a person's soul, and the intriguing topic of the types of economic man in Christianity, including Puritan, Lutheran, Reformed, Quakers, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. He believes that the branding of 'economic man' is unavoidable in religion. This study focuses on examining the relationship between the Eastern Orthodox Church's economic man and the capitalist market economy and identifying the differences with other types of economic man.",0
50,7,"The section titled ""The Development of Economic Ethics and Sen's Claim of Economic Ethics"" explores economic ethics and economic systems through Sen's ideas about human freedom, development of capabilities, and lifestyle choices. Within Sen's words, there are underlying suggestions about the concept of an ""economic man"" based on his understanding of freedom. This concept of the economic man is revisited in the concluding section of the paper.",0
50,8,"Bulgakov, a renowned Russian Orthodox theologian, was unique in that he also had expertise in economics, having taught Marxist economics at both the Lomonosov Moscow State University and the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. However, he gradually became more interested in Orthodox theology and was ordained as an Orthodox priest in 1918. His political beliefs eventually resulted in his expulsion from the Soviet government in 1922, after which he established the Institute Saint-Serge in Paris, France, where he taught dogmatics until his death in 1944. Bulgakov's diverse background allowed him to investigate various issues, from Orthodox ethics to alternative economic systems and economic development, often drawing on the Christian economic ethics of M. Weber. As a result, his ideology has influenced modern business ethics and capitalist economic ethics. In this course on capitalist economic ethics, we will delve further into Bulgakov's life, academic pursuits, and contributions.",0
50,9,"Bulgakov grew up as a devout Orthodox Christian in a family of Russian Orthodox priests. However, during high school, he became an atheist and a Marxist. He gained recognition as a Marxist specialist with the publication of his monograph on ""Production in a Capitalist Market"" in 1896. After returning from Western Europe in 1901, Bulgakov was influenced by the works of Kant and Schelling and began to question Marxist economics, particularly the contradiction between the rule of concentrated production and rural production, leading him to publish his Master's thesis on ""Capitalism and Agriculture"". He then underwent a transformation, believing that human life and society were based on absolute values such as truth, goodness, and beauty, and subsequently published ""From Marxism to Idealism"" in 1903 to explain his ideological shift. Bulgakov confessed that he initially saw himself as a pure social scientist, but he was eventually compelled to explore issues of righteousness, truth, and the existence of God when investigating the foundation of the social system. As a result, he became interested in the relationship between Christian ethics and the economy or society, which became a major focus of his research.",0
50,10,"Bulgakov explored the idea of a man-God and analyzed aspects of pseudo-Christianity found in both materialistic atheism and Marx's socialism. For instance, he compared the prophecy of socialism's development and the fate of capitalism to the eschatology found in Christian theology. Additionally, the proletariat's mission mirrored that of God's chosen people, who had specific vocations, while capital was seen as Satan. Bulgakov wrote two essays on this topic - ""Pristine Christianity and Last Socialism"" in 1909 and ""Apocalypse and Socialism"" in 1910. Regarding economic ethics, Bulgakov argued that Marx's socialism or atheist pseudo-religion was centered around a self-righteous man-God, akin to Christ or a saint but hostile towards Christianity and God-man saints. This man-God goes against the unique personality and soul of Christian economic man. (Adapted from Lossky 1952, pp. 200-202).",0
50,11,"The dissertation 'Philosophy of Economy: the World as Household' by Bulgakov delved into not only the concept of an economic man but also human economic behaviors. Bulgakov viewed the correlation between labor and the realistic world as the focal point of economic endeavors. Economy was seen as a bridge that connected a living person with the realistic world, which could not be accessed by the dead who lost their ability to communicate with it. For a Christian, a person's rebirth and immortality meant he or she could continue to consume in the realistic world. Production was viewed as the labor rights and responsibilities of an individual in the realistic world (Bulgakov 2000; Valliere 2000, pp. 253¨C278).",0
50,12,"Bulgakov extensively discussed economic ethics and the concept of Christian economic man in various works such as ""The Soul of Socialism"" (1932-1933), ""Social Teaching in Modern Russian Orthodox Theology"" (1934), and the monograph ""The Orthodox Church"" in ""Orthodox Church and Economic Life"" (1935). As an economist and Russian Orthodox theologian, Bulgakov explored the relationship between Christianity and socialism, ultimately contending that socialism was soulless. In his thinking, he considered the properties of an economic man in Christian terms following the Orthodox style, and then discussed the foundation of economic ethics from a Christian viewpoint in both socialist and capitalist economic systems.",0
50,13,"Economic growth in Economics originates from Adam Smith's ""An Inquiry into the Nature and Cause of the Wealth of Nations"" and was further scrutinized by J. M. Keynes' ""The General Theory of Employment, Interest and the Money"", which had a profound impact on academic reexamination of economic growth. Scholars such as R. F. Harrod, E. D. Domar, R. M. Solow, N. Kaldor, J. Tobin, and others analyze economic growth based on labor productivity, capital accumulation, and advancements in production technology.",0
50,14,"The Supply-Side School prioritizes reducing government control and taxes, as well as controlling inflation to boost the aggregate supply function and stimulate economic growth. Nonetheless, Amartya Sen's 1998 Nobel Prize win has shifted the focus of economic growth research and increased consideration of the ethical and moral components linked to economic development.",0
50,15,"According to Sen (2000), economic development can only be achieved when factors that hinder free will are eliminated. He also emphasized the importance of critical thinking in Economics and credited economists such as Sir William Petty, Leon Walras, Francois Quesnay, David Ricardo, and Augustine Cournot for pioneering engineering analysis in the field. Furthermore, Sen (1987) and Evensky (2007) noted that the relationship between Economics and ethics was established when ethical considerations were given weight by notable economists like Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, and Francis Edgeworth.",0
50,16,"Christianity places great importance on the concept of human freedom, which is valued by various divisions such as the Eastern Orthodox Church, Catholicism, and Protestantism. The question of 'who is man?' and 'what is the relationship between man and God?' arises when discussing human freedom. The term 'Imago Dei' from the Old Testament's Genesis is used to explain who man is, where man's inherent characteristics of rationale, free will, and morality are used to describe man's reflection of God and their special relationship. Karl Rahner, a Catholic theologian, describes man as the receiver of the Word of God to explain the relationship between man and God. However, it is unclear whether man's mirror image of God, which was destroyed by Adam, can be restored through salvation or whether it only came into existence after the Original Sin, with some parts intact and others damaged.",0
50,17,"Luther spoke about the virtue of having faith amidst the uncertainty and limited freedom. Christians with faith can freely pursue their needs without feeling compelled to please God or gain recognition from him. On the other hand, those without faith are unhappy and worrisome. Salvation comes through complete trust and wholehearted waiting for God, with a complete abandonment of self-directed activities. Consequently, only after redemption can man truly be free to serve God. (Althaus and Schultz 1972, pp. 37¨C39; p. 55; Brendler 1991; Hummel 2003).",0
50,18,"Eastern Orthodox Theology emphasizes the Eastern origins of Christian religious rites and beliefs due to the fact that the majority of early churches were located in the East. Additionally, Orthodox theologians assert that the Greek language more accurately conveys Christian doctrine and that Latin terminology cannot fully convey the subtle differences in concepts expressed in Greek theology.",0
50,19,"Sen's economic development theory focuses on the correlation between human liberty and development. True freedom renders individuals capable of tapping into their potential and expertise to attain a particular position, occupation, or social standing, such as volunteers, doctors, soldiers etc., referred to by Sen as 'being.' This concept differs from Weber's religious notions of 'calling' or 'Beruf.' According to Weber, Calvinist Puritans aimed to become Berufsmenschen, serving God's kingdom through austerity and reshaping the world. Capitalists can efficiently utilize voluntary productivity, resulting in increased labor productivity, according to Weber. However, the capitalist mode of production eventually replaced humans with machines, eliminating the need for asceticism, which led to the Beruf concept evolving into wealth acquisition without any spiritual or ethical connotations. Asceticism gave birth to capitalism but slowly declined with the rise of capitalism.",0
50,20,"Bulgakov proposed a fusion between man's role as Logos in the economic world and asceticism, as well as the responsibility of governing and abandoning the world, since he considered man as the Logos and creator of this world. The new economic man motivated by this labor mechanism could increase productivity. Bulgakov's 'homo economicus' differs from Calvinist's 'Berufsmensch' as the former has an ascetic nature and exists only as an identity of Logos, while the latter assumes his profession as a calling and regards his work as a lifetime mission bestowed by God upon him. Man collaborates with the Holy Spirit to deify the world and governs it after creation.",0
50,21,"The Logos of the economic world is how man is defined in the Eastern Orthodox concept of the new economic man. According to this concept, God assigns man to govern and create while also endowing him with labor rights and obligations to participate in God's mission of world divinization. This context makes ""instrumental freedoms"" seem beneficial for economic convenience and freedom, as well as basic human rights and economic rights for free trade in the market. Utilizing Sen's proposed development strategy to create a good environment and safeguard freedom could be most beneficial to Russia's overall economic development.",0
50,22,"Bulgakov's views on Christian economic man were examined in relation to Sen's arguments about the connection between human economic behavior and economic systems. The study also looked into theological concepts like human freedom, God's calling, predestination, justification, mysticism, deification, and economic ethics within a particular economic system. The research also touched upon Weber's work on the man working in a calling within the context of Lutheranism and Calvinism.",0
50,23,"Bulgakov's rejection of Marxism was elaborated in his statements about the economic man from 1903 to 1911, and his later works, including 'Philosophy of Economy', were influenced by Weber's concept of a Christian economic man. Bulgakov discussed various interpretations of this concept within different Christian contexts, but it did not receive as much attention as the traditional economic view of the economic man. This suggests that there is potential for further research in this area.",0
50,24,"Sen's investigation of shifting the rationale and self-interest-focused economic man to a liberated economic man falls short of capturing the essence of an economic man's soul, as explained in von Mises's works on the first chapter's portrayal of economic behavior and the third chapter's discussion of free will, which is considered an essential aspect of analyzing a person's economic conduct (von Mises, 2006). In comparison, Bulgakov's depiction of a Christian economic man and Weber's idea of a man laboring with a purpose, referred to as a Calvinist economic man by Bulgakov, are more aligned with von Mises's idea of an economic man.",0
50,25,"Bulgakov and Weber both focused on the connection between an economic system and religious ethics. While Weber highlighted the influence of Calvinist economic ethics on an economic man, Bulgakov expanded this concept to include an economic man in Christianity. Additionally, both authors discussed the idea of a soulless economic man. Bulgakov believed that a materialist economic man in Marxism would lack a soul, while Weber argued that many workers in the last stage of capitalism had lost their Protestant ethics and become soulless.",0
51,1,"The aim of this article is to make clear the underlying assumptions that were presented during a recent discussion regarding the feasibility of utilizing computer models for economic planning. Furthermore, it seeks to present extra points in relation to the debate on economic calculation.",0
51,2,"The article presents further evidence to support the idea that computing in a controlled economy involves dealing with limitless, uncountable domains. Furthermore, it refutes the criticisms made by certain scholars in 2007 against Murphy's theories.",0
51,3,"The practical significance of computation and calculation within an economic system cannot be overstated. The economic calculation problem plays a critical role in determining institutional settlements and policies. Certain institutional frameworks may hinder the ability to rationally allocate resources through economic calculation. Therefore, the conclusions of the economic calculation debate hold immense importance. When defining institutions and policies, economists and philosophers must consider the possibility of computation and calculation within an economic system.",0
51,4,"The question of whether economic problems can be solved using computability theory is the focus of computability in an economic system. While modern computing devices have immense calculating power, we cannot always assume that any problem, including economic ones, can be solved with enough time and resources.",0
51,5,"The economic problem involves the rational allocation of resources in a system. Even individuals with self-sufficient lifestyles must address this issue, as there are typically more wants and needs than available resources. The scarcity of time is a significant example of this problem, as prioritizing objectives is crucial for this limited resource.",0
51,6,"Von Mises argues that even if a collective form of property lies at the core of an economic system and the planner possesses all the necessary information, economic calculation still cannot be carried out. For the sake of his argument, von Mises assumes that the planner has complete technological knowledge of that time and holds an inventory of all the production factors. A group of experts provides all the essential information, and every individual of the society agrees on the common goals. However, the planner faces an insurmountable problem of selecting the best method or project from an enormous amount of options available to achieve the desired ends. For instance, in constructing a house, there exist different methods, each with its benefits and drawbacks regarding the final product, resource consumption, and production time. The planner is compelled to compare diverse variables such as labor, production time, productivity of tools and machines, quality of building materials, and resource consumption to determine the optimal approach in a scenario where everything is the same.",0
51,7,"In a complicated economy, the production methods come in a variety of forms. The means of production fall somewhere in between specific and non-specific. If every means of production was either specific or non-specific, then deciding on the method of production and the means to be used would be a technological problem rather than an economic one. Even in a simple economy, making a rational choice between diverse means and methods of production would have some limitations. In a complex economy, the main difficulty doesn't come from deciding what final goods to produce. This can even be resolved in a socialist economy. However, the real issue arises when choosing the most favorable means and methods of production to reach the ultimate goal. This becomes an insoluble problem for the planned economy (von Mises, 1998, pp. 207-8, 13).",0
51,8,"The significance of market prices lies in how they allow for reasoned decision-making when it comes to choosing the most suitable means and methods of production among numerous available options. This is made possible through monetary calculation based on market prices, which are formed within a private property system where entrepreneurs bid for the goods they require, both final and intermediate. Overall, this approach constitutes the solution to the economic issue of resource allocation.",0
51,9,"Abba Lerner and Oskar Lange acknowledged the significance of market prices in economic calculation, but they dismissed the notion that a free market, based on private property, is an essential prerequisite for economic calculation. They argued that planners can emulate any market outcome. Lange, in his papers of 1936 and 1937, advocated for market socialism. He maintained that three types of data are essential for calculation- individual preferences, prices, and knowledge about available resources. An important contrast between von Mises and Lange is their conception of prices. Lange believed that prices could be determined by knowing individuals' preferences and the quantity of available resources. He recommended a trial and error process or a Tatonnement solution for identifying the ""correct"" equilibrium prices of goods. Conversely, von Mises believed that price determination can only occur in a market economy that is based on private property.",0
51,10,"Lavoie (1981) revised the argument made by von Mises against socialism and argued that the critiques are not nullified by the advocates of market socialism. The basis of Lange's solution was the Walrasian model of static equilibrium, which according to von Mises was not a suitable framework as it did not account for dynamic adjustment and discovery amidst constantly changing conditions such as technologies and preferences. Lavoie maintained that von Mises did not deny socialist economic calculation in static conditions, but this is not applicable in reality. Economic calculation in a collective economy is impossible in principle, and the computation argument is underplayed as the equations cannot be set up from the start.",0
51,11,"In the upcoming section, we'll examine a recent discussion about the boundaries of computability within an economic system that relies on central planning and collective property ownership. Robert Murphy, who took on a revised stance in the economic calculation debate, put forth a fresh argument to bolster his thesis that the computational models can't solve the economic problem in theory (Murphy, 2006). On the other hand, Cottrell et al. (2007a, b) held to the standard stance in the economic calculation debate and challenged Murphy's argument.",0
51,12,"According to Murphy, the argument is not formulated in one step. The first point highlighted is the continuous innovation by entrepreneurs in the market process, which means that the list of goods to be produced is always open-ended. To mimic the market process, the central planning unit must take into account all possible future goods and commodities that may appear in the market, including fiction books, movies, services, and intermediate goods. Consequently, the central planner must have the corresponding lists of prices of all final goods and implicitly of all intermediate goods necessary for producing consumer goods.",0
51,13,"Considering an application of Cantor's diagonal argument to prove the existence of an uncountable set, Hunter (1996) finds it helpful in illustrating why the number of prices is uncountably infinite.",0
51,14,"Cottrell et al. (2007a, b) argued that R. Murphy failed to provide evidence that the set of market prices is either infinite or uncountable. They claimed that every commodity is produced from a finite number of other commodities, and therefore, the number of all commodities must also be countable. This is because every commodity can be represented by a unique integer identifier based on a Godel number composed of the number of atoms of each element it contains. Based on this reasoning, Cottrell et al. concluded that all possible commodities could be enumerated, and therefore, the set of commodities is finite and countable. Since the set of commodities is countable, so is the set of corresponding prices (Cottrell et al., 2007a, b).",0
51,15,"Cottrell et al. (2007a, b, p. 3) posed a thought-provoking question about the notion that although there may be infinite uncountable prices in a market economy, individuals do not need to consider all of them to make economic decisions successfully. If they did, the problem of economic calculation would be insurmountable. Therefore, it seems unclear why Murphy insists that a central planning unit must take into account all possible prices, goods, and services, even those which may not exist yet.",0
51,16,"Taking into account all possible prices is not only motivated by the innovation problem, but also by the nature of private property in a market economy. In this system, individuals express their preferences through market exchanges but are limited by the finite amount of possessions they have to exchange. In contrast, in a society with collective forms of property, individuals have unlimited preferences which the central planning unit must take into account. Mimicking market processes requires the planner to consider all the virtually infinite preferences of individuals resulting in an infinite set of prices, which aligns with the theory of subjective value.",0
51,17,"The initial query about whether it is truly an infinite uncountable range of prices remains unresolved. Rather, we emphasized that the group of possible individual preferences is boundless as there are no restrictions on individuals expressing their preferences.",0
51,18,"The utilization of Cantor's diagonal argument displays that the set of prices the planner must consider is not only infinite but also uncountable. The reasoning begins by defining each good and its price through equations that utilize a set or a subset of preferences. It is also assumed that the set of potential preferences of individuals is infinite (p1, p2...pn). By applying the technique of changing each ""Yes"" to ""No"" and each ""No"" to ""Yes"" on the diagonal, a new subset of preferences, unlike any other existing or future subsets, can be defined. Hence, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all potential preferences and the set of natural numbers, but there is no such correspondence between the set of all subsets of preferences and the set of natural numbers. Consequently, the number of subsets of preferences used to define prices of goods is an uncountable infinite set (Table III).",0
51,19,"The issue of the infinite uncountable set of preferences cannot be solved by the consumer goods market alone, even if the consumer preferences are finite. This is because the preferences of managers and entrepreneurs are still an infinite uncountable set. The market often sees managers and entrepreneurs supplying products that are not specifically requested by consumers. Entrepreneurs' investment preferences are also restricted by the capital they possess. Alternatively, in a planned economy, the central planning unit still has to determine the prices of intermediate goods while taking into account an infinite uncountable set of prices. As an example, The Matrix by the Wachowski brothers was not written in response to consumer demands.",0
51,20,"In the debate on economic calculation, Lange suggested that the planner must rely on market prices for consumer goods to deduce the prices of intermediate goods. However, von Mises countered that this would not solve the problem because the planner would face the same challenge at the intermediate goods level. von Mises argued that the prices of intermediate goods are not determined by a technical method, as production factors are not entirely specific or non-specific, and there are many ways to produce final goods using intermediate goods. While the prices of intermediate goods may partly depend on individual preferences for final goods, entrepreneurs ultimately bid for different amounts of intermediate goods to establish prices. Market prices for intermediate goods assist entrepreneurs in finding the most profitable solution. As a result, the planner will confront a similar problem at the intermediate goods level as they did with consumer goods.",0
51,21,"After reviewing Murphy's arguments, we utilized Cantor's theorem from set theories to refine and rephrase our points. Our thesis is that for a planned economy, a computational model must consider an uncountably infinite set of equations and prices. It follows that the central planner would struggle to establish all the necessary calculus equations, rather than compute the vast number of equations required. With this in mind, we believe computational models cannot replicate the market process.",0
51,22,"The economic calculation debate relies heavily on the concept of price formation, which is influenced by the prevailing theory of value. As such, the presuppositions surrounding value are crucial in this debate. However, Cottrell and colleagues' objections failed to take into account the true conception of value and price formation in the Austrian School of Economics. Consequently, we have dismissed their objections to Murphy's (2006) theses.",0
52,1,"The study examines citizens¡¯ economic expectations during the 2008-2009 global economic crisis, which are identified as crucial for political attitudes. Unlike previous research which took place during stable economic times, this study considers the impact of information on economic evaluations during severe crises. Using a three-wave panel study and media content analysis, the study provides a dynamic assessment of media influences on changes in economic evaluations. Results show a significant effect of media exposure on expectations regarding the future development of the national economic situation, but not on personal economic expectations. The study also reveals that media dependency exacerbates the magnitude of the media effect. The authors discuss the disparity between personal and national economic evaluations regarding mass-mediated economic information.",0
52,2,"The economic expectations of citizens are shaped by information about the economy, which can be influenced through personal experience, interpersonal communication and media coverage. This article narrows its focus to the impact of media coverage on changing economic expectations during times of crisis and which specific expectations are affected. The study primarily focuses on the influence of the media on assessments of the national economy, rather than personal economic expectations. It is hypothesized that mediated information largely shapes evaluations of the national economy.",0
52,3,"The research analyzes how feedback changes over time, cautiously estimating the impact of information. Additionally, it draws on previous studies that suggest media effects vary in intensity for different audience segments. To refine our insight into the correlation between economic media coverage and citizens' assessments, the study integrates media content and poll data, associating media coverage indicators with diverse economic evaluations. It also considers the potential moderating effect of news dependency on media outcomes.",0
52,4,"According to existing literature, citizens' economic expectations in established democracies have primarily been studied during periods of economic stability. Therefore, this study is one of the first to examine economic perceptions during times of rapid and unequivocal deterioration. In times of an economic crisis, individuals often experience uncertainty about their economic future, which may prompt them to engage in information-seeking behavior. Additionally, heightened media attention during difficult economic times may further emphasize the importance of mass-mediated economic information.",0
52,5,"Rational choice theorists argue that citizens are not expected to possess complete information about the economy all the time, and instead, they are ""rationally ignorant"" about general affairs (Downs, 1957). However, several studies indicate that citizens possess significant knowledge relating to economic topics such as the unemployment rate, mainly during election periods (Paldam and Nannestad, 2000). Nonetheless, there are various reasons why citizens' perceptions of economic conditions may differ from reality (Hetherington, 1996). First, citizens may use different criteria to evaluate economic condition (Kinder et al, 1989). Second, citizens' preferred party may impact their perception of favourable economic conditions, biased towards a particular party being in power (Kramer, 1983; Wlezien et al, 1997; Van der Eijk et al, 2007). Lastly, the study focuses on the role of mass media as a central information provider influencing the citizens' perception and evaluation of the economy.",0
52,6,"The political impact of the economy is often studied through citizens' perceptions and evaluations of it, known as the subjective economy. Previous research on this topic has looked at the role of the mass media in shaping these perceptions and ultimately influencing voting behavior. Studies have found that subjective assessments of the economy, rather than objective indicators, have been successful in explaining election outcomes, highlighting a potential distortion between the perceived and actual state of the economy. Examples such as the 1992 US Presidential elections and the 2001 UK General elections illustrate this phenomenon. Therefore, it is important to consider the subjective economy when examining the intersection of politics and economics.",0
52,7,"Media's effect on economic assessments has been mainly studied on a macro-level. Mosley's (1984) study revealed that media's perceptions of economic situations have a stronger influence on economic assessments than official economic indicators. Sanders et al. (1993) and Goidel and Langley (1995) also found that the tone of economic news coverage affects public assessments in the UK and the US, respectively. However, negative news coverage alone impacts public evaluations according to Soroka's (2006) recent analysis, which agrees with Ju's (2008) findings. However, some studies, such as Haller and Norpoth's (1997) and Wu et al.'s (2000), didn't find any notable impact of economic news on assessments.",0
52,8,"The authors argue that media effects are more likely to occur in sociotropic evaluations of the national economy rather than egocentric evaluations of personal economic situations. While citizens may experience noticeable economic changes in their immediate surroundings, national economic developments are often unobtrusive and require media or social interactions to become aware of. Mutz (1992) found that media coverage of unemployment uniquely identifies perceptions of unemployment as a social problem, while personal experience with unemployment contributes to perceptions of it as a personal problem.",0
52,9,"It is important to consider how positive and negative economic news coverage can affect public opinion differently. Research has shown that people tend to pay more attention to negative information and are more likely to draw on it when forming opinions. This is consistent with prior studies that indicate negative information and threat frames have stronger effects on public opinion than positive information. Additionally, classic persuasion studies show a prevalence of threats and negativity. Recent studies suggest that people are more likely to pick up negative information about the economy, so it is expected that negative economic news will have a stronger impact than positive news.",0
52,10,"The idea that mass media equally affects all citizens is oversimplified, as recent political communication research suggests. In our study on media effects on economic assessments, we take this contingency approach and consider how an individual's reliance on media can impact their opinions and evaluations. Media system dependency theory argues that those who rely heavily on news for information are more likely to be affected by media messages. This theory has been supported by experimental research on health communication effects.",0
52,11,"The primary objective of this research is to examine how the media affects the way people evaluate the state of the economy. Specifically, we are looking into the possible effects of media reporting tone, specifically future economic prospects communicated through mass-media channels, on how citizens assess the economy from a societal, future-oriented perspective. This inquiry builds on previous scholarly works such as Soroka (2006).",0
52,12,"Based on a news content analysis and a three-wave panel survey, we investigate the expectations mentioned earlier. Respondents disclosed their exposure level to outlets that underwent content analysis, and the survey data and media content were combined. This approach enables us to examine the economic information that respondents were exposed to and how this exposure influenced changes in their economic outlook between different timeframes.",0
52,13,"Due to practical limitations, we had to use a more restricted group of media outlets for the second phase. However, the descriptive findings show significant similarity between outlets in that phase. For example, two of the three most negative outlets in the first phase are still the most negative in the second phase (Metro phase 1: -2, NRC Handelsblad phase 1: -1.78, Metro phase 2: -2, NRC Handelsblad phase 2: -1.69). In addition, in the first phase, 9 of the 11 outlets assessed for national economic assessments fall between -1 and -2, and this is true for seven of the eight outlets assessed in the second phase. Furthermore, repetition of the analyses for the first phase, which only considered those outlets available in the second phase, produced very similar findings. This gives us confidence that our more limited selection of outlets for the second phase is sufficient.",0
52,14,"Data for testing the hypotheses comes from a three-wave panel survey of Dutch citizens who are eligible to vote. From a pool of 143,809 citizens in an online panel, 2,400 individuals older than 17 are randomly selected and invited to complete an online questionnaire. Of the selected individuals, 1,394 completed the questionnaire, resulting in a 58% response rate (RR1). Comparison of the census data from the Dutch electorate indicates that groups underrepresented in our sample include men (47.0% vs. 49.4%), young citizens (30.8% vs. 34.2%), and those who have intermediate vocational education (31.3% vs. 48.0%).",0
52,15,"We conduct multiple OLS regression analyses to evaluate the hypotheses. We provide four models each for sociotropic and egocentric expectations, where we regress economic expectations at t2 and t3 on previously mentioned variables, while adjusting for economic expectations at t1 or t2. This lagged variable emphasizes the change of the dependent variable between two waves, and including prior economic assessments as controls reduces the chances of models being underspecified, as it includes predictors of static economic evaluations with the lagged term. This approach is similar to Markus (1979).",0
52,16,"Interestingly, our findings indicate that changes in sociotropic expectations were not influenced by personal economic circumstances, while changes in egocentric expectations were somewhat linked to household income. Given that household income can serve as a substitute measure for data on individuals' economic status, these results suggest that people draw upon various sources of information (such as personal experience versus mass media) when creating distinct types of economic expectations.",0
52,17,"During our study, there was no significant change in the egocentric expectations at the aggregate level. Despite the worst crisis in half a century, people still believed that their personal finances would not be affected. This trend is not unique to the Dutch population but seen all over Europe. The reason for this may be a lack of experience with severe economic crises or a psychological phenomenon of people not believing that misfortune can happen to them. Additionally, the crisis takes time to translate into individual financial considerations, as economists have noted. Overall, citizens do not link macroeconomic figures to their personal finances.",0
52,18,"Our research contradicts prior studies that found a negativity bias in media effects on economic perceptions. This could be because the news coverage during our research period was overwhelmingly negative, meaning an increase in negative news did not significantly impact the independent variable. However, it is important to note that previous research only established a negativity bias on a macro-level, and it is possible that micro-level dynamics operate differently, especially during times of economic crisis when the news environment is highly negative. Additionally, we cannot compare our findings to a positive economic news climate, and future studies should explore how media effects differ in times of crisis compared to times of economic growth.",0
52,19,"This research expands on previous studies by considering the conditional nature of news effects. Our results support the idea that media dependency plays a significant role in moderating media influence. Specifically, we found that individuals who rely more heavily on the news have a stronger reaction to positive and negative economic information, confirming our third hypothesis (H3). These results align with the findings of Ball-Rokeach et al (1984), who discovered that media effects were most pronounced among individuals with high levels of dependency. To improve our understanding of why people rely on the media for information, future research should explore factors beyond our current model. Additionally, our findings imply that, while outlet-specific exposure was crucial in the first period, media dependency had a direct impact on expectations in the second period.",0
52,20,"Despite these limitations, our findings have contributed to the comprehension of economic evaluations and their relationship with media coverage. It is crucial to recognize that media representation of the economy can influence political outcomes. If a positive economic outlook results in more votes for a particular party and vice versa, then the negative depiction of economic prospects in the media is hazardous for those in power. This could also have a spiral effect on the economy if individuals who have a pessimistic view of the future are less likely to consume and thus impact economic conditions. Although our study was conducted during a unique economic period, these dynamics have relevance beyond the crisis we investigated.",0

53,1,"A knowledge economy relies on the use of knowledge to produce goods and services, making economic models important for understanding how it functions. The financial system plays a crucial role, as any failure can halt progress. Due to the complex nature of society, cross-disciplinary approaches are necessary for a comprehensive understanding. The failure of mainstream economic theory during the first decade of the 21st century demonstrated the need for a new, valid theory. However, the schools of economics did not collaborate, leading to scholastic conflict. To reexamine economic theory, both exogenous and endogenous modeling from conflicting economic schools can be used to model different parts of the economic system.",0
53,2,"Economic theory failed to explain empirical reality in the years following the financial crisis of 2008, and there was disagreement among economists on how to construct valid theory. Despite this, there was a contentious debate instead of an immediate rush to change economic theory. Mainstream economic theory assumed a perfect market, but the financial market was far from perfect. This was exemplified in 2012 when Jean-Claude Trichet, then president of the European Central Bank, complained that the available models were of limited help during the crisis.",0
53,3,"Davies previously held positions as Director of the London School of Economics, Chairman of Britain¡¯s Financial Services Authority, and Deputy Director of the Bank of England. As an economist and banking authority, he criticized how contemporary economic theory was applied to real-world situations. Davies believed that the previous approach to regulation was flawed, as it relied heavily on financial institutions to control risk. He noted that this was demonstrated during the financial crisis, resulting in stricter regulation. Davies emphasizes the importance of reevaluating current intellectual models to establish a stable relationship between financial authorities and private firms. (Davies 2012).",0
53,4,"In 2010, it was reported that many academic economists agreed that the financial and economic crisis had exposed flaws in their subject, and urgent ideas were needed to keep economics relevant. Despite the participation of five Nobel prize-winners in economics at the inaugural conference of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, held at King's College, Cambridge and sponsored by billionaire financier George Soros, there was disagreement on the cause and necessary remedies for the crisis. Some argued for tighter regulation due to asset price bubbles, while others believed that price swings were fundamental to the beneficial forces of capitalism. Michael Goldberg from the University of New Hampshire disagreed that the price swings were necessarily a bubble. (Giles 2010).",0
53,5,"Charles J. Whalen stated that the financial crisis of 2007-2009 not only affected the world economy, but also highlighted the limitations of traditional economics.

(Whalen 2012).",0
53,6,"In 2009, Paul Krugman examined the state of economics and noted that there was a time when the discipline was highly successful, both theoretically and practically. According to economists, internal disputes had been resolved and the ""central problem of depression-prevention"" had been solved. This led many to celebrate a ""golden era"" for the profession. However, in 2008, the financial crisis hit, revealing that many economists were blind to the possibility of catastrophic market failures. The field's predictive failure was not as important as its collective belief that markets were inherently stable and assets always priced correctly.",0
53,7,"Macro economists continue to be divided on this issue. Some argue that free-market economies never go astray, while others assert that economies may deviate from their path of prosperity, but can be corrected by the Federal Reserve. The reality of an economy that goes off the rails, despite the best efforts of the Fed, was not considered by either camp. In the aftermath of the crisis, Krugman observes that the fault lines among economists have become even more pronounced.",0
53,8,"According to Krugman, the persistence of the fault line can be attributed to the economics profession's over-reliance on aesthetics. Economists mistook beautiful, mathematically-clad theories for truth and clung to the idealized vision of capitalism being a perfect or near-perfect system. This vision proved unsustainable when faced with mass unemployment, but economists fell in love with it again as memories of the Great Depression faded. Unfortunately, this romanticized view of the economy caused economists to ignore the potential dangers of human irrationality, institutional problems, market imperfections, and inadequate regulation by regulators. (Krugman 2009).",0
53,9,"When the supply of a commodity increases in an economy, the price (dotted line) will decrease as a result of business competition and more goods flooding the market. Conversely, if the demand for a product (solid line) increases, the price will rise due to limited supply. The ideal price of a product (commodity) is achieved when the supply equals demand, resulting in an equilibrium price where no control over pricing is required as the market sets the optimal price.",0
53,10,"Neo-Keynesians contended that the Neo-Classical Synthesis School's economists had a limited perspective regarding an economy, viewing it only as a production system. Ben Bernanke noted that economists had overlooked the significance of a healthy financial system for economic growth and the function of financial conditions in short-term economic dynamics. Economic theorists in the decades following World War II prioritized developing broad equilibrium models of the economy with complete markets, ignoring market ""frictions"" like imperfect information or transaction expenses. However, financial markets have little rationale for existence in the absence of such frictions.",0
53,11,"Minsky contended that incorporating a time dimension in the economic model was crucial. In 1936, Keynes had already introduced the concept of time in economics, which included finance as an element of the model. Keynes aimed to create a model of the economy where money was never neutral to pricing by establishing a model where the price level of financial assets is determined in financial markets. The price of money is an asset that derives its value from liquidity, and each capital and financial asset yields an income stream with carrying costs and varying degrees of liquidity. The relative value of assets' liquidity and income determines the assets' price level. (Minsky 1993)",0
53,12,"In a Keynesian financial model, time plays a crucial role in determining the value of a capital asset, which is an investment that generates income and can be sold in the future. The two key concepts here are present-income and future liquidity, which refer to the income stream generated by the asset in the present and its potential value when sold later. This time dimension is represented by T1 (present-income) to T2 (future liquidity), and it is facilitated by the exchange of credit and debt in a financial system. Borrowing and lending is the foundation of capitalist economies, and it involves exchanging money in the present for money that will be paid back in the future, with interest and principal included in the contract. (Minsky 1993)",0
53,13,"The time dimension of any financial system consists of the past (credit), present (interest payments), and future (debt repayment). This temporal process is essential for economic models according to Keynesians. Financial markets determine the liquidity of capital assets based on their value. Each asset has an income stream, carrying costs, and a certain level of liquidity. The price of assets is determined by their relative value in the future and their current liquidity. Financial markets allow credit-debt contracts to be sold in the future through providing future liquidity. Capital assets require both current income and future liquidity.",0
53,14,"The Neo-Classical Synthesis School centered on the production subsystem, where the current commodity price played a crucial role in controlling it. On the other hand, the Neo-Keynesian School focused on the financial subsystem, where the future price of a capital asset controlled it. The modeling challenge lies in integrating both theories in a complementary framework, which can be achieved through a meta-framework like societal dynamics theory. The topological systems model of a society is used in this meta-framework, where the economy is an economic subsystem consisting of production and financial sub-subsystems. For more details, refer to Betz (2011).",0
53,15,"In a model of how society functions, there are four types of subsystems that make up the major systems of an industrialized society: economic, cultural, political, and technological. These subsystems can be shown as stacked planes. In economics, the traditional view is that an economy has three parts: producing, distributing, and consuming goods and services. The production subsystem takes material and energy resources and turns them into goods and services financed by a financial system. These goods/services are then consumed in a market. So, any economic system can be divided into four subsystems: production, market, finance, and resources. The exogenous school's model is seen within this broader societal context as the production subsystem of the economic system, while the endogenous school's model is viewed as the financial subsystem of the economic plane.",0
53,16,"Next, we will integrate economic models from various social science fields to create a comprehensive cross-disciplinary economic system, bridging the partial models of the endogenous and exogenous schools. The aim is to understand how the societal economic subsystem functions as a whole.",0
53,17,"To differentiate between micro and macroeconomics, we begin by integrating partial models from other disciplines into microeconomics. To construct a model for a productive economic agent, we turn to management science and adopt the standard ""enterprise model"" introduced by Michael Porter. The productive organization can be represented as a system that acquires resources and labor from its environment and converts them into value-added products that are then made available to the consumers. This portrays an open system model of a firm, which functions by taking in inputs from the environment and then selling its products back into it.",0
53,18,"The supply-demand equilibrium pricing model is only useful for certain products in a particular area of the industrial supply chain. The first arrow shows that a company's model is part of a specific industry sector, while the second arrow indicates that the supply-demand curve is specific to that sector.",0

54,1,"The impact of economic freedom, civil liberties and political rights on growth is analyzed in this research. A system of three equations is utilized to determine the ways in which these institutional aspects impact economic growth, including improved efficiency and increased investment in human and physical capital. The study incorporates 79 countries and covers six periods from 1976 to 2005. The findings reveal that institutional quality plays an important role in economic growth through resource allocation and the encouragement of investment in physical and human capital.",0
54,2,"The determinants of economic growth and the variations in real incomes between nations are a primary focus for economists. Despite a plethora of literature on this topic, empirical research has only partially been successful in uncovering the factors driving economic growth and inequality. Consequently, more and more explanatory variables have been added to growth models, including institutional factors in addition to traditional variables like labor, physical and human capital, and technology used in neoclassical and endogenous growth models. (Olson 1982, 1996).",0
54,3,"In recent years, many researchers have incorporated institutions into growth models, including Ak?omak and Weel (2009), Barro (1996), Easterly and Levine (2003), Hall and Jones (1999), Mauro (1995), Rigobon and Rodrik (2005), Stroup (2007), and Yang (2008). While most of these studies have found a positive and significant effect of institutional quality on economic growth, the results are not conclusive. Economic freedom and political freedom have been the most studied dimensions of institutional quality (Aixal¨¢ and Fabro 2009). Therefore, this study focuses on analyzing the impacts of these two aspects on growth.",0
54,4,"Civil liberties and political rights are often merged as political freedom, but they have distinct meanings that affect economic growth differently. Civil liberties allow for expression, media freedom, organization, the rule of law, and personal autonomy. Political rights enable political engagement, such as voting freely, competing for office, joining parties, and electing accountable representatives who impact public policies.",0
54,5,"""Regarding various concepts of freedom, Milton Friedman (2002) suggests the use of three classifications instead of only two: economic, civil, and political freedom. According to him, political freedom encompasses the configuration of the political structure, right to vote, and democracy as a system where civil servants are elected through citizens' votes. On the other hand, civil freedom includes human rights such as freedom of speech, assembly, and expression. Hong Kong provides an example of this distinction, where citizens had high civil freedom but lacked political freedom under British rule. It is possible for a country to have high levels of civil and economic liberties without political freedom, but achieving political freedom without economic freedom seems difficult. In China, the promotion of economic freedom may lead to more political freedom.""",0
54,6,"Ariel Benyishay and Roger Betancourt assert that the safeguarding of civil liberties as a means of protecting human rights is a crucial measure of the extent to which the rule of law exists in a society. The curtailment of human rights, whether through more overt violations like the loss of life or imprisonment, or through subtler means like limiting one's capacity to make choices or exercise one's liberties, ultimately results in the deprivation of property rights. According to the authors, civil liberties play a vital role in enabling markets to function robustly, as they are socially constructed and thus contribute to fostering long-term economic growth.",0
54,7,"The paper aims to clarify how institutional quality influences economic growth by utilizing a system of three simultaneous equations. To analyze the direct and indirect effects on growth, investment in physical capital and human capital were added to the growth equation. Panel data techniques and weighted two-stage least squares were used to overcome heteroskedasticity and endogeneity issues. The paper also accounted for the time that elapses between institutional changes and their impact on growth by introducing lag variables.",0
54,8,"Scholars who support the property rights school, along with some of North's ideas, argue that economic freedom boosts productivity by reducing transaction costs. This, in turn, encourages the accumulation of human and physical capital stocks, promotes specialization and economies of scale, fosters business innovation, and creates more efficient organizations. To function properly, the market requires well-defined and precise property rights because without them, negotiating the allocation and distribution of resources would become prohibitively expensive. High transaction costs limit market opportunities by causing a lack of transparent information and entry barriers that discourage new competition and international trade. Economic freedom is widely acknowledged as the institutional characteristic that has the most significant and positive impact on growth. This idea has received support from various sources, including Azman-Saini, Baharumshah and Law (2010), Carlsson and Lunsdtr?m (2002), Dawson (2003), De Vanssay and Spindler (1994), Easton and Walker (1997), International Monetary Fund (2003), Justesen (2008), and Stroup (2007).",0
54,9,"One aspect of economic freedom that has garnered attention recently is regulation, with studies showing it has a negative impact on growth. Cole et al. suggest that Latin America's low TFP is due to competition barriers and stagnant relative TFP is the main determinant of income and productivity stagnation. Dawson argues that reducing regulation positively affects growth through investment and TFP channels. Licerio, Fullerton, and Clark show that deregulation leads to per capita income gains.",0
54,10,"Robert Barro's (1996) argument is that the relationship between democracy and growth is non-linear. He claims that in countries with lower levels of political freedom, higher levels of democracy can encourage growth because it limits government abuse. However, high levels of democracy can hinder growth when there is already a moderate level of political freedom. Barro suggests that widening political freedom may actually slow down growth once a certain threshold is reached, partly due to the emergence of redistributive pressures.",0
54,11,"Amartya Sen (1999) proposes that to have a satisfactory conception of freedom, we must recognize their interconnectedness and their role as both intrinsic and instrumental. He argues that political and social freedoms are desirable and conducive to economic growth. Sen emphasizes the importance of economic development as an integrated process that expands substantive freedoms encompassing economic, social, and political considerations. This broad approach allows us to appreciate the vital roles of various institutions, including markets, governments, political parties, education programs, and civic institutions, in the development process.",0
54,12,"The acknowledgment that economic freedom promotes growth is widespread. However, it is essential to recognize the significance of not only markets but also economic, social, and political freedoms in enhancing and improving people's overall capabilities. From an instrumental perspective, Sen identifies five types of freedom: political, economic, social, transparency, and security, all of which are interconnected. Promoting these various instrumental freedoms can aid in achieving public policy objectives that foster human capacity and substantive freedoms. Development analysis must recognize the empirical connections between these freedoms to strengthen their collective importance. In essence, understanding the instrumental role of freedom requires recognizing the vital connections between them.",0
54,13,"According to some empirical papers (Giavazzi and Tabellini 2005; Persson and Tabellini 2006), economic liberalization must precede the expansion of political rights for growth to occur. Closed economies with fledgling democracies encounter conflicts of redistribution, while open economies with established democracies prioritize economic efficiency. Moreover, economic liberalization fosters the rule of law and improved protection of property rights, both necessary for democracy to generate growth (Giavazzi and Tabellini 2005).",0
54,14,"Political freedom is often measured through civil liberties and political rights in empirical research (Farr, Lord, and Wolfenbarger 1998; Helliwell 1994; Wu and Davis 1999). However, the results obtained are diverse and less robust compared to economic freedom due to the conflict between costs and benefits as pointed out by theory. Some studies indicate that democracy has an overall positive impact on economic growth (Gwartney, Lawson, and Block 1996; Hanke and Walters 1997; Rigobon and Rodrik 2005; Rodrik 1999a; Scully 1988; Varsakelis 2006). But, others find that this relationship is weak and not significant (Alesina et al. 1996; Ali and Crain 2002; Barro and Sala-iMartin 1995; De Haan and Siermann 1995, 1996; Mulligan, Gil, and Sala-i-Martin 2004), and some studies show a slightly negative correlation between political freedom and economic growth (Helliwell 1994; Tavares and Wacziarg 2001).",0
54,15,"The timing of complex causal relations between institutional factors and economic results is often not considered in empirical research. While some effects may be immediate, others have a delayed structure. Economic freedom is an example of this, as it may require time before producing a tangible outcome. In such cases, credibility becomes a crucial aspect in growth processes. This is particularly relevant in countries with a history of inconsistent policies and strong opposition to liberalization policies.",0
54,16,"It is important to consider the distinction between direct and indirect impacts of institutional quality on growth, as this has been frequently overlooked and polarized opinions. The impact of economic freedom on growth has been debated, with some arguing that it primarily affects productivity rather than the accumulation of productive factors while others claim it promotes growth through better total factor productivity and the accumulation of both human and physical capital. Some critics believe that growth is only stimulated through increased resource allocation efficiency while others prioritize investment as the driving force behind growth.",0
54,17,"In terms of political liberty, some scholars suggest that while promoting the accumulation of human capital, democracy could also facilitate growth (Mariscal and Sokoloff 2000). The proof for physical capital, however, is not so decisive. Philipp Harms and Heinrich Ursprung (2002), Matthias Busse (2004), and Jos¨¦ Tavares and Romain Wacziarg (2001) have discovered that democratic countries draw foreign direct investment, whereas Adam and Filippaios (2007) contend that democracy might reduce private investment. In the case of physical capital investment, Jos¨¦ Aixal¨¢ and Gema Fabro (2009) indicate that only economic liberty is important, but for human capital investment, economic and political freedoms are applicable.",0
54,18,"In order to gain a better understanding of the economic growth processes, it is important to clarify these channels. Additionally, if the accumulation of human and physical capital is used as explanatory variables, one should keep in mind that the institutional variable coefficient may not reflect the complete effect on economic growth and could lead to incorrect conclusions. To address this issue, simultaneous equation models can be used, although they are rarely utilized (with the exception of studies by Alesina et al. 1996; Faruk, Kamel and V¨¦ganzon¨¨s-Varoudakis 2006; Leite and Weidman 2002; Rigobon and Rodrik 2005).",0
54,19,"Institutional change can be challenging and slow as institutions are often deeply ingrained in a country's history and culture. Moreover, those who resist change may oppose comprehensive reforms. However, in developing countries, institutional changes can occur rapidly. The IMF has shown that since the mid-1980s, there has been significant progress in the establishment of the rule of law globally, particularly in the early 1990s. Central and Eastern European nations, which have undergone political and economic reforms, have experienced a comprehensive strengthening of their institutions. The IMF has also identified radical changes in ""post-conflict"" states like Afghanistan and Kosovo.",0
54,20,"The institutional data used in this paper are the civil liberties and political rights indices annually published by Freedom House since the early 1970s. These indices provide strict evaluations from regional experts, human rights specialists, academics, journalists, and political figures. Additionally, the world economic freedom index published by the Fraser Institute is referred to in this paper, which mostly includes quantifiable and objective data but still involves some subjective evaluations from researchers and experts (refer to Appendix 1, p. 1077).",0
54,21,"The reason for selecting economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights indices is due to the reputation of the organizations that issue them. Furthermore, they accurately depict the concepts they intend to measure, and their extensive coverage of time and countries makes them ideal for applying panel data techniques and examining lags in the variable to analyze the time delay with which these freedoms influence growth. The World Development Indicators database of the World Bank was utilized for the other variables such as growth of per capita GDP (PPP), investment in physical capital, rates of enrollment in primary and secondary education (as investment in human capital), trade, and initial income.",0
54,22,"Institutional dimensions have expected signs and are generally significant when considered individually. Neoclassical theory predicts negative sign for initial income in growth equation and it is significant in eight of nine estimations, confirming convergence hypothesis. Physical and human capital investment variables have positive coefficients and statistical significance in all estimations except for human capital which is not significant in three equations. Explanatory variables rate of enrollment in primary education and openness have expected positive sign and are highly significant in all estimations for investment in physical and human capital equations.",0
54,23,"The findings regarding the institutional variables studied indicate that economic freedom (as shown in Table 1) has a notable effect on growth because it enhances resource allocation and encourages investment in physical and human capital. Economic freedom is found to be highly significant in all three equations of the system (systems 1 and 2). When the analysis includes two lags (system 3), economic freedom remains significant in the physical capital investment equation, leading to an improvement in the model's explanatory power.",0
54,24,"The notions of the property rights school and the contributions made by North (1990) and Olson (1982) that were later incorporated by growth theory, regarding the significance of economic freedom in promoting the accumulation of physical and human capital, decreasing transaction costs, and increasing productivity, are supported by the empirical evidence obtained. The presence of civil liberties (Table 2) and political rights (Table 3) has a crucial role in improving resource allocation and investment in physical and human capital (systems 1, 2, and 3), thereby facilitating growth. When two lags of the variables are taken into account, the importance of civil liberties and political rights persists across the three equations, and the explanatory capacity of the models is enhanced.",0
54,25,"Further studies (Gwartney, Lawson and Holcombe 1999; Hanke and Walters 1997; Stroup 2007) validate the perspective on economic freedom having a more significant impact on growth than civil liberties and political rights. As indicated in Table 4, superior coefficients for this institutional dimension are observed when current values are considered. Nonetheless, it's worth noting that in the case of human capital, civil liberties have a coefficient almost as large, and when variable lags are incorporated, economic freedom's supremacy diminishes.",0
54,26,"This study aimed to reveal the significance of institutional aspects such as economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights on economic growth. Additionally, it aimed to distinguish between their direct and indirect impacts. The findings indicated that the quality of institutions is crucial for the economic advancement of countries as it promotes a better distribution of resources and investment in physical and human capital. Furthermore, the study showed that economic freedom has the most significant impact on economic growth, closely followed by civil liberties in terms of investment in human capital. However, when considering lags, civil liberties and political rights remain highly significant, while economic freedom loses its relevance.",0

Economic liberalization encompasses changes in financial and trade liberalization. This study is unique in that it synthesizes an economic liberalization index by utilizing principal component analysis. Based on our findings, we discovered that economic liberalization policies have a favorable effect on economic growth in the short term. Nevertheless, trade liberalization had a negative influence on economic growth in the long term. Additionally, the rolling window analysis found that the effect of economic liberalization on real GDP was unstable during the chosen sample.

The first eigenvector value was used as a weight in our research to create a composite measure of trade openness, referred to as TLI. TD, M, and X contributed to 71.6%, 54%, and 44.2%, respectively, in the standardized variance of the first principal component.",0
55,7,"The SBC method is used to determine the optimal lag order before estimating cointegration tests, as the JJ Cointegration approach is highly sensitive to the lag order employed. The results from Table 5 indicate the presence of a cointegration relationship in models 1-12, as indicated by the trace test. However, the cointegration vector differs across the models; models 1, 3, 4, 9, and 10 have one cointegrating vector, while models 2, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 12 have two cointegrating vectors. Only in model 8 are three cointegrating vectors discovered.",0
55,8,"The purpose of rolling window regression is to evaluate the consistency of variable coefficients over a specified data period. Unlike available cointegration econometric methods that assume model coefficients to be constant throughout the sample, the real economy fluctuates frequently due to changes in economic indicators. Hence, the estimated coefficients of these indicators cannot remain unchanged throughout the sample.",0
55,9,"The FLI, trade openness index, and ELI for Pakistan covering the period 1971-2011 were constructed in this paper. The order of integration was determined using augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root tests. To estimate the long run and short run relationship, the JJ cointegration, Fully Modified Least Squares and error correction model were utilized. The stability of the coefficients was verified using the rolling window regression method.",0
56,1,"The study investigates the connection between economic growth and the stock market, as well as bank financing in Portugal between 1993 and 2011. The analysis involved the use of Vector Autoregressive (VAR) modeling, along with Granger causality, variance decomposition, and impulse response function. It was discovered that Portugal's integration into the European Monetary Union resulted in a change in economic regimes, and that the subprime crisis had an impact. In terms of causality, there was evidence of bidirectional linkage between economic growth and the stock market, but no evidence of causality from bank financing to economic growth.",0
56,2,"The correlation between economic growth and the financial system, including stock markets and the banking system, has been the subject of research for many years by scholars such as Beck and Levine (2004), Capasso (2008), Goldsmith (1969), Keynes (1973), Levine (1991), and Schumpeter (1982). Generally, Anglo-Saxon nations depend more on capital markets for corporate financing, whereas non-Anglo-Saxon nations rely mostly on the banking system, as noted by Marini (2005) and Lee (2012).",0
56,3,"The relationship between the financial system and growth can be better understood by using long series and controlling for structural changes. In the case of smaller economies, like Portugal, structural changes can have a stronger impact, making it an ideal case study. By examining the interaction of variables during the 1990s and 2000s, a period of significant economic and political change, we can gain valuable insights. As a non-Anglo-Saxon country, Portugal's banking system is expected to be more influential in the economy than the stock market.",0
56,4,"According to the findings, the growth of the economy is influenced by the stock market, as it shows Granger causality. However, there is no confirmation of such causality from the banking system to the economic growth. The study provides insights into the formulation of effective economic policies for the financial sector, highlighting the significance of the stock market and banking segments.",0
56,5,"The definition of stock market development is not clear, however, Demirgu?-Kunt and Levine (1996) suggest four indicators for studying it: 1) market capitalization, 2) volatility measured by standard deviation of stock market, 3) indicators of institutional development, and 4) regulation indicators. It is important to consider the banking system, which can be measured using the ratio of domestic credit to GDP or the ratio of monetary aggregate M2 to nominal GDP. Inflation is also commonly used in the model for robustness.",0
56,6,"There have been discussions and studies on the relationship between the financial system and economic growth, primarily in quantitative terms through cross-country, panel data, and time series analyses. Several studies have shown causal relationships between stock markets and economic growth, and the direction of causality can be from stock market to economic growth, economic growth to stock market, bidirectional, or non-existent. The analysis of causality has been extended to include the short and long run as well as strong causality, which could have a significant impact on economic policy decision making.",0
56,7,"Financial development resulting from endogenous growth processes has been extensively studied in literature (e.g. Bose and Cothren, 1997; Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1990). It is expected that variables are interdependent and interact, leading to an endogenous adjustment effect. The VAR technique is useful in evaluating these relationships, as it treats variables as potentially endogenous without the need to differentiate between endogenous and exogenous variables like in the simultaneous equations model. This technique was applied by Caporale et al. (2004) and Tsouma (2009) in analyzing the link between developed stock markets and economic growth.",0
56,8,"Based on the results, in order to accurately analyze the impact of the stock market on economic growth, it is necessary to consider certain variables as exogenous, such as the constant, seasonal dummies, one impulse dummy in the second quarter of 2000, and two shift dummies. Additionally, it is important to control for the physical introduction of the euro notes and coins/integration in Euronext, as well as the subprime crisis in Portugal which occurred from the last quarter of 2008. The VAR results also indicate that the physical introduction of the euro had a greater impact on the economy than the integration in Euronext, as shown by the highly statistically significant negative signal of the shift dummy in the GDP and stock market equations.",0
56,9,"The VAR estimation is carried out by determining the optimal lag structure using a series of tests such as the sequential modified LR test, the final prediction error, and the Akaike information criterion. All these tests consistently show three lags, highlighting a parsimonious model with no signs of the omission variable bias. Further evaluation of the VAR model is conducted through diagnostic tests that include the Jarque Bera test for normality, LM test for autocorrelation, and the White test for heteroskedasticity (without cross terms), as shown in Table 3.",0
56,10,"The main objective of this paper is to analyze how stock markets and bank financing systems contribute to economic growth, and it emphasizes the importance of comprehending this relationship when creating economic policies. If one of the systems shows a more significant response to innovation, policymakers should prioritize action towards that system.",0
56,11,"The Granger causality, variance decomposition, and impulse response function have proven that the competing systems are different. When there is innovation in one system, there is a decrease in the relative weight of the other system, as shown in Fig. 3. The response of bank financing to innovation in the stock market is faster and more pronounced, compared to the reverse. Generally, bank financing is more inward-looking than the stock market. This result was unexpected because Portugal is a non-Anglo-Saxon country, and bank financing is expected to be common among corporations, and therefore play a significant role in Portuguese economic growth.",0
56,12,"The outcomes presented in Table 5 align with the findings obtained through the exogeneity tests. Evidently, all factors exhibit a dynamic pattern that is a prerequisite for endogeneity (refer to Table 5 and Fig. 3). Concerning DLY, after a lag of two-quarters, triggering events to DLY elucidate approximately 85% of the variability in the forecast error. However, this influence lessens to around 59% by the end of the 10-quarter period. A comparison between the consequences of DLS and DLB shows that DLS has a significantly higher impact on the forecast error variance than DLB, i.e., around 15.5% and 3%, respectively, at the end of the ten-quarter period. Shocks to DLI intensify persistently, leaping from roughly 2.5% to 5.8% in explaining the forecast error variance. As projected, when concentrating on models that incorporate financial determinants, controlling for nominal effects is necessary. Indeed, at the end of ten-quarters, events that stimulate DLP clarify around 16.6% of the variance in the forecast error.",0
56,13,"The article examines the impact of stock market development on economic growth in Portugal (1993-2011), which is a small economy that experiences significant effects due to structural changes. It also compares the effects of two financing systems - stock market and bank financing - on economic growth. No cointegration relationship was found. The study used a VAR model with impulse and shift dummies, which proved to be suitable for analyzing the contribution of stock market and bank financing to economic growth. However, the analysis should include Portuguese idiosyncrasies. The absence of these controls could distort causal relationships among variables, leading to incorrect conclusions.",0
56,14,"It has been observed that there are two distinct behaviors within the financial system's components. Firstly, there is a positive causal relationship between economic growth and stock market development, which is bidirectional. Secondly, the banking system seems to benefit from economic growth but is not driving it. Therefore, economic policies should focus on promoting stock market development rather than bank financing for economic growth. Future research should aim to understand the transmission channels between financial markets and economic growth.",0
56,15,"The Portuguese reality was proven through the use of control variables. The results showed that investment did not have significant multiplier effects, and there was a clear loss of economic price competitiveness. Unique factors specific to Portugal were also taken into consideration, including the break in the GDP series in 2000, the currency change to the euro, and the subprime crisis. These factors are crucial for a complete understanding of how finance impacts the economy.",0
57,1,"During times of financial crisis, we examined economic voting using survey data from the 2008 and 2011 Canadian Election Studies. It is suggested that the economy's impact on incumbent voting during a crisis can be twofold. The first impact is based on retrospective evaluations of national economic circumstances, which are necessarily unfavorable given the crisis. The second impact is based on perceptions of the parties' ability to manage the economy, and the competence effect can offset incumbent vote losses resulting from poor economic conditions depending on these perceptions. By analyzing competence-based issue ownership, we can introduce a neglected valence component to the economic voting model in broader terms.",0
57,2,"According to the theory of voting behavior, the economy is a typical valence issue (Stokes, 1963). In democratic societies, all parties and voters generally agree that economic growth is a desirable objective. In other words, there is a virtual consensus among parties and voters regarding their stance on this issue, since society as a whole has a shared view of what needs to be achieved economically. What mainly concerns voters is whether the government achieves this goal or not. A government that delivers on this goal has a higher probability of being re-elected at election time, while failure to do so poses a severe risk of being voted out of office.",0
57,3,"The concept of 'traditional economic voting' expectation was introduced by Lewis-Beck in 1988, which forms the foundation of a valence model of economic voting, as explained by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau in 2011. This model suggests that voters assess the government's previous economic record and make their decision based on it, thus holding the government responsible for the country's financial condition.",0
57,4,"The current formulation of the valence model of economic voting focuses primarily on voters' retrospective evaluations of economic conditions. However, it is reasonable to assume that voters also consider the issue-handling capabilities of the competing political parties. The reputation of parties as competent political actors is an essential aspect of the valence model of political choice. Therefore, recent studies have examined the impact of perceptions of party competence in managing the economy on voters' choices.",0
57,5,"We aim to incorporate both aspects of economic voting, namely retrospective economic evaluations and issue ownership, into a single model for incumbent vote. Previous research on the valence model of economic voting has largely disregarded the latter dimension, with few exceptions. Considering both of these dimensions is crucial, especially during an economic crisis. In such times, economic voting can be expected to have a dual impact. Firstly, there will be the typical effect based on retrospective economic evaluations, which will inevitably be negative. Secondly, there will be an impact based on perceptions of the parties' economic management competence. The degree of influence that this has will depend on the public's perceptions at the time, but it may be able to counteract losses in incumbent vote resulting from the bad economic situation.",0
57,6,"Through survey-based analyses of the vote for/against the incumbent Conservative Party of Canada in the 2008 and 2011 federal elections, we have provided empirical evidence of the dual effects. Despite the economic crisis context, the Conservatives won both elections, indicating that the traditional economic voting hypothesis alone may not fully account for the role of the economy as a valence issue in determining election outcomes.",0
57,7,"In Canada, five federal elections coincided with or followed serious economic crises. Interestingly, the incumbent party won three of them (1974, 2008, and 2011), while facing defeat in the other two (1984 and 1993). This contradicts the economic voting theory, which suggests the incumbent should lose in all such situations. To explain these results, the authors propose distinguishing between two valence dimensions of economic voting - the classic dimension and issue ownership dimension - and explore them in two of the elections more closely. The following sections elaborate on their theoretical considerations and expectations.",0
57,8,"According to the principle of government accountability, incumbent politicians are held responsible for the economy, and citizens will reward or punish them accordingly. This relationship has been explored extensively in the United States, as well as in other Western democracies. Recent studies have considered factors such as institutional arrangements and voters' levels of awareness to better understand the connection between the economy and voting patterns. Notable studies in this regard include Powell and Whitten (1993) and Anderson (2007).",0
57,9,"The 'valence' model of economic voting is the fundamental expectation that Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011) propose. They differentiate it from policy-oriented economic voting and patrimonial economic voting. Policy-oriented economic voting pertains to voters' varying opinions about economic policies, while patrimonial economic voting is influenced by individuals' financial assets. Economic voting, as per Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011), is not a single-dimensional phenomenon. Our argument in this article is the incorporation of a second valence dimension to the valence model of economic voting, party competence. Therefore, we assert that the valence model of economic voting is multidimensional.",0
57,10,"The valence interpretation of economic voting posits that voters are primarily concerned with the incumbent party's economic performance in the recent past when casting their ballot. Valence models of political choice suggest that voters also take into account the incumbent's reputation and comparative performance. Recent studies have further highlighted the importance of political parties' perceived competence in dealing with the economy in shaping voters' choices. This perspective has been explored by a growing number of researchers, including Sanders, Bellucci, Butt, Smith, Martinsson, B¨¦langer, and G¨¦lineau.",0
57,11,"During times of financial crisis when the economy does not provide an advantage to the incumbent party, they may choose to focus their campaign on a different issue, as suggested by Vavreck (2009). Alternatively, they may still emphasize the economy but present it in a more positive light to project a favorable image of themselves compared to their opponents, according to Nadeau et al (2010). Therefore, an incumbent party's economic competence can become a crucial element of their campaign message.",0
57,12,"The second aspect of the economy's valence dimension is focused on looking back. However, it differs from the typical dimension as it takes a comparative approach. Instead of just measuring the current party's economic record, the competence dimension assesses their economic performance in comparison to other countries. This means that voters ask if the nation's economy is doing better than comparable economies, even in tough situations. If it is, then the incumbent party is seen as having done well and may still receive support despite the crisis. This cognitive process is called benchmarking and is conceptualized by Duch and Stevenson as voters extracting signals about the government's relative economic competence. (Kayser and Peress, 2012).",0
57,13,"Issue ownership's competence-based component is determined by the performance of parties in handling specific issues, which can be assessed through comparison and benchmarking, particularly in the economy. It differs from the ""associative"" component, which depends on the history of attention given to specific issues by parties and their policy priorities. This distinction between valence and policy dimensions of issue ownership is similar to the one we discussed earlier between the traditional economic voting hypothesis and Kiewiet's policy-focused view of economic voting. For further information on this essential distinction, refer to Walgrave et al's 2012 study.",0
57,14,"Issue ownership is a crucial factor in explaining why incumbents may not face consequences for poor economic performances, according to our argument along with Martinsson (2009, p. 230). Previous studies have focused on institutional and contextual factors without considering the parties' perception as economic managers. We believe that issue ownership is an essential component in understanding economic voting.",0
57,15,"The influence of competence on incumbent voting is expected to have affected the results of the 2008 and 2011 Canadian federal elections. If voters saw the incumbent party as the most competent at managing the economy, they were more likely to support the Conservative Party, while seeing an opposition party as the most competent would decrease support. B¨¦langer and G¨¦lineau studied similar effects in the 2008 Quebec election, while Martinsson investigated the issue of unemployment in six Swedish national elections. Our study focuses on competence in the economy, broadly defined, for two consecutive Canadian national elections.",0
57,16,"We utilize two measures to gauge the sociotropic economic evaluations retrospectively. Initially, we employ the customary measure based on a standard question asking if the Canadian economy has improved, worsened, or remained stable over the previous year (better = +1, same = 0, worse = ?1). This measure helps to capture the conventional economic voting effect. However, Gidengil et al (2012, p. 77) found a weak impact of this measure in their study on economic voting in the 2008 Canadian election. They propose that many voters didn't hold the Conservative government responsible for the economic downturn as the financial crisis primarily erupted in the United States (Gidengil et al, 2012, pp. 79¨C82). Hence, we devise a second measure of retrospective economic assessments that accounts for responsibility attribution. This measure weighs the original variable of economic perceptions based on whether the respondent attributes responsibility for favorable (or unfavorable) national economic conditions to the government's policies.",0
57,17,"The study's measure of political parties' competency as economic managers is derived from respondents' answers to the question 'Which party do you believe would be most effective in dealing with the economy?' The coding of the competence variable takes into account a dichotomous dependent variable where a response in favor of the Conservative Party is coded as +1, while naming another party as competent is coded as -1. No competency named, all parties seen as equally competent, or unsure responses are coded as 0. In the 2008 survey, the question is asked only to half of the sample, while the other half is asked about job creation. The researchers also consider job creation as relevant to economic crisis context as it is additional evidence of economic voting. The methodology in the study is similar to previous studies by B¨¦langer and Meguid (2008); B¨¦langer and G¨¦lineau (2011).",0
57,18,"Prime Minister Stephen Harper called for the 2008 Canadian federal election just before the economic crisis in the American housing and financial markets. Canadians realized that their economy started to slow down and might collapse over the coming months. CES data indicates that 81% of respondents outside Quebec believed that the economy issue was crucial in that election, and 17% said it was relatively important. It was not surprising that 46% of respondents felt that Canada's economy had deteriorated over the past year, with 39% felt no changes, and only 14% believed that it had improved. Based on the traditional economic voting hypothesis, we would expect that these negative economic evaluations would have harmed the incumbent Conservatives.",0
57,19,"The 3-point measure of past economic assessments in the first model is replaced by the 5-point economic responsibility measure in the regression model presented in Column 2 of Table 1, although both indicators have been standardized to run from ?1 to +1. The economic voting is still significant with the use of the economic responsibility indicator, which aligns with Gidengil et al's (2012) intuition about economic voting in the 2008 Canadian election. During a global economic crisis, the incumbent government cannot be fully responsible for a country's worsening economic conditions, only those voters who blame its policies would vote against it, which is what the economic responsibility indicator attempts to capture. Economic voting did occur in 2008, and it impacted the incumbent party since most Canadian voters believed that economic conditions had declined, or at least had not improved. However, it occurred most strongly among the smaller group of people who attributed credit or blame to the government's policies, everything else being equal.",0
57,20,"Although the two models in Table 1 have a very small difference in terms of model fit, responsibility attributions do contribute to the traditional economic voting effect to some extent. However, it is not a significant increase in the explanatory power of the model. The article argues that focusing solely on retrospective economic perceptions is insufficient for understanding economic voting, particularly during financial crises. As predicted, party competence in economic management can either counteract or reinforce perceptions of the economy in hard times.",0
57,21,"The impact of the two valence dimensions of economic voting on the probability of supporting the incumbent party, while everything else remains constant, is being studied. To demonstrate this impact more concretely, the findings are converted into marginal effects obtained through logistic regression results. The enhanced valence model of economic voting estimated for 2008 is used as a basis for this purpose, and the results are similar for the other models. The retrospective national economic evaluations and party competence on the economy are altered while all other independent variables remain constant to assess their impact on the predicted probability to vote for the incumbent party, and these simulation results are tabulated in Table 8.",0
58,1,"The traditional neoclassical method of economic theorizing does not consider economic emergence and entrepreneurship. We explore why entrepreneurship, a crucial economic behavior, has been disregarded in mainstream economic theory. However, evolutionary economists have recognized the significance of emergence, and we discuss the advancements made in this field. We propose that evolutionary economics can progress by adopting a more 'naturalistic' approach to economic evolution. This requires full integration with complex economic system theory, explicitly dealing with how people react to uncertainty. We argue that 'knowledge' is partly conjectural due to uncertainty and linked to our emotional states. Economic behavior is also affected by our status as dissipative structures, leading us to introduce 'energy gradients' and 'knowledge gradients' as essential concepts in understanding economic emergence and growth.",0
58,2,"Neoclassical economics assumes that economic decision making is based on logic and constrained optimization, but this rule only works in simplistic contexts with certainty or quantifiable risk. It cannot accurately predict behavior in situations of uncertainty where significant changes can occur, leading to economic emergence and the formation of new network structures.",0
58,3,"Evolutionary economics has directly addressed the concept of economic emergence. This field is concerned with how economic systems undergo transformations from within. As evolutionary theory is based on change, it encompasses a range of behavioural rules adopted by economic decision-makers. Nelson and Winter (1982) highlight the significance of behavioural routines. This is because economic agents need to operate in historical time, with all the uncertainties it brings. In evolutionary economics, economic agents reduce the uncertainty they face and achieve their economic goals by adhering to bundles of rules. Economic emergence occurs through the formation of radically new bundles of rules that contribute to capital goods, productive networks, contracting systems and human skills. The process of 'self-organization' shapes this emergence, honed by 'competitive selection', where various technologies, organizational structures, institutions, and procedures dominate.",0
58,4,"In order to understand economic emergence, it is necessary to consider both genetic and culturally acquired drivers of human behavior, as well as how these interact with the energetic requirements of living systems. To analyze economic behavior, it is also important to understand the institutional rules that govern different cultures and how these change with circumstances. This does not mean traditional economic analysis should be discarded, but rather that the limits of calculative behavior must be recognized. Evolutionary theories prioritize diversity of behavior over uniformity, so the question of whether behavior is optimal based on logical criteria is less important than understanding the range of individual responses to available information.",0
58,5,"The article is structured into different sections. Section 2 gives a historical overview on the challenges economists have faced in capturing emergence in economic analysis. Although heterodox economists may already be familiar with the content, younger mainstream readers will benefit from this. Section 3 covers how evolutionary economists have tackled economic emergence, highlighting the main points of differentiation from the mainstream. Section 4 focuses specifically on entrepreneurship, which is considered to be the leading catalyst of economic emergence by evolutionary economists. Section 5 explores the motivation behind taking large entrepreneurial risks in uncertain situations and how this can be studied using complex adaptive systems theory. The article concludes with some final remarks in Section 6.",0
58,6,"In the 1950s, economics shifted towards a logical framework that could not accommodate emergence. This overlooked crucial factors driving economic growth and instead relied on a force field representation of a fully connected network system from 19th century physics. The neoclassical tradition remained dominant in microeconomics, but the Keynesian Revolution raised questions about its adequacy in representing economic behavior. Though macroeconomics took on a non-neoclassical flavor, with medium-term multiplier-accelerator models and Harrod's theory serving as the baseline for economic growth and development planning.",0
58,7,"Neoclassical economists focused on improving the microfoundations of macroeconomics instead of addressing technological change in their growth models. This perspective was popularized by the neoclassical synthesis interpretation of Keynesian economics, which paved the way for neoclassical economists to gain ground in the fields of business cycle and growth theory. However, the complex mathematical models that emerged from these areas were challenging to deal with and lacked empirical evidence, leading neoclassical economists to rely on simple analytical foundations based on representative optimizing agents. Unfortunately, these theories failed to account for economic emergence as they did not consider the role of entrepreneurs, differentiated firms, or the Marshallian flux that characterizes economic activity.",0
58,8,"The focus of economics shifted in the latter half of the 20th century to constrained optimization as a way to appear more scientific. This shift came at the expense of considering economic emergence and behavioral traits that did not fit with narrow neoclassical rationality. This resulted in economists ignoring warning signs of the 2008 financial crisis. John Maynard Keynes' insight on 'animal spirits' influencing business investment was also dismissed by neoclassical synthesis, which simplified the Keynesian narrative as labor market failure in an otherwise well-functioning non-neoclassical world.",0
58,9,"In the early 1990s, endogenous growth theorists argued that Solow's unexplained residual could be explained by adding 'knowledge' as a production factor with unique features that lead to economies of scale and externalities. This theory is based on neoclassical ideas, where a 'stock' of knowledge is produced by research and development, which produces innovations that can be transformed into new capital equipment for sale to consumer goods producers. However, this theory only tells us what we already knew: investment in education and training is crucial, promoting innovation is critical, and patents are helpful, but too much protection can be harmful. The equilibrium endogenous growth theory does not explain the process of economic emergence, although it aims to be explanatory. Furthermore, the primary driver of economic growth, entrepreneurship, is practically disregarded.",0
58,10,"Although mathematical representations can capture ""weak"" emergence in processes such as competition and innovation, they do not fully account for ""strong"" emergence, which refers to more radical innovations and entrepreneurship. For economic growth to occur, there must be a deterministic component in emergent processes, as economic systems are dissipative structures that need to remain structurally coherent over time. This structural persistence can be estimated through econometrics, but it is an incomplete representation of an evolution process that involves structural change. Therefore, the statistical residuals in a logistic diffusion model estimated econometrically contain all the non-deterministic components of an emergent process, in addition to normal Gaussian stochasticity.",0
58,11,"Evolutionary economists have successfully addressed weak emergence in their theories and empirical applications. They also acknowledge the importance of strong emergence as the foundation for economic evolution and growth. Despite Joseph Schumpeter's influential work on the role of entrepreneurship in generating novelty, it remains analytically challenging for evolutionary economists. Further development is needed before a comprehensive treatment of economic emergence can be achieved.",0
58,12,"Emergence involves the concept that wholes are greater than the sum of their parts, which is an old idea recognized in mainstream economics. Evolutionary economics and business strategy analyze this process through the operation of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial individuals or groups set up networks of connections between machines and people, use organizational rules, and access energy sources. The field has seen contributions from evolutionary economists using case studies or agent-based simulation.",0
58,13,"The success of a company's physical, cultural, conceptual, and organizational structure often leads to a historical lock-in that limits the firm's ability to adapt. This creates an evolutionary dilemma, where tighter specialized connections in networks increase efficiency but make adaptation more difficult as specialized organizations are less flexible. Industries as whole have more adaptive potential than individual firms, making an overly rational neoclassical approach a handicap. IBM is a notable example of a highly efficient but non-adaptive organization that required a separate branch to innovate and create personal computers. Complexity theory recognizes that optimizing a system often involves suboptimal behavior in individual components.",0
59,1,"The policy structure of India has undergone changes due to the recent efforts towards liberalizing the economy and reducing government intervention. This study aims to assess if economic freedom leads to higher economic growth in India, which is a federal system with varying business regulations, taxation, and government spending across states. A pooled linear regression model is used to analyze categorical data containing economic freedom and its components as independent variables, and income per capita and gross state domestic product growth rates as the dependent variable for 20 states across three time periods- 2004/2005, 2006/2007, and 2009/2010. The study considers variables like initial income per capita, literacy rate, sectoral composition, and inflation rate as control. The results indicate that economic freedom has a significant positive impact on economic growth, with the size of government, strong rule of law, and flexible regulations governing credit, labor, and product markets being the key factors positively influencing income growth.",0
59,2,"Market-oriented reforms have been widely recognized as a catalyst for economic progress (Berggren 2003). The establishment of market liberalization and institutions to promote the market forms the basis of the Washington Consensus (World Bank 2002).

Market-based institutions play a significant role in conveying information effectively, ensuring property rights and contracts, and promoting competition, which foster economic development (De Vanssay and Spindler 1994; Alesina 1998; De Haan and Siermann 1998; Nelson and Singh 1998) according to the World Bank (2002). These institutions are intended to promote economic freedom by providing incentives for growth, such as low taxes, an independent legal system, and private property protection (Murphy et al. 1991; Gwartney 2009). They also stimulate dynamic and organized economies, where effective regulation encourages free and fair competition while suppressing the number of government companies (Johansson 2001).",0

The greater visibility of the free market economy has led to impressive growth rates in India's national and per capita incomes.

59,6,"There has been a long-standing belief, dating back to Adam Smith, that economic freedom can lead to growth and prosperity. This freedom, as defined by Hayek, refers to the absence of coercion. Evidence shows a strong correlation between economic freedom and growth, as competition in free economies tends to promote faster growth. Additionally, liberal economies provide more opportunities for entrepreneurship and private investment. While economic freedom is an important indicator, its individual components can have varying impacts on the overall health of the economy.",0
59,7,"According to Parente and Prescott (2000), the importance of security of property rights for economic growth is widely agreed upon. This is because having secure and transferable rights to assets and contracts encourages investment and leads to growth, as owners are confident that they will benefit from their investments. The efficient allocation of assets that comes with security of property rights also contributes to growth (World Bank 2002), as savings can be directed towards activities with high expected profits. Rodrik (2000) suggests that security of property rights, when complemented by a well-functioning legal system, can act as a necessary institution for economic freedom.",0
59,8,"Access to a stable currency is another aspect of economic freedom that mainly focuses on controlling inflation. High and unstable inflation can hinder economic growth, but moderate inflation can make it easier for prices and wages to adjust to market shocks. Inflation also allows for greater flexibility in real wages, leading to lower long-term unemployment rates. However, the impact of inflation on growth is still uncertain based on empirical evidence.",0
59,9,"There could be efficiency effects from trade liberalization, indicated by the freedom to trade internationally. This interaction with the global market may lead to the dissemination of technology. When exchange is based on comparative advantages, free trade can enhance the productivity of domestic firms with the presence of international competition. However, the relationship between trade liberalization and economic growth remains inconclusive, with some studies reporting positive linkage while others are skeptical. Sachs and Warner (1995) and Rodriguez and Rodrik (2001) hold differing opinions, and Greenaway et al. (2002) provides evidence in support of a positive relationship. Yanikkaya (2003), on the other hand, remains skeptical.",0
59,10,"Regulating labor, credit, and business is considered a crucial aspect of economic freedom. Research suggests that reducing regulations can promote growth and benefit businesses (Calmfors and Driffill 1988; Baumol et al. 2007). Unfavorable labor laws and disputes can impede business operations. Inadequate infrastructure and raw materials can also hinder business performance. High transaction costs limit trade and economic activities, which restrict the economic freedom of individuals (Debroy et al. 2011).",0
59,11,"The analysis of economic freedom at state-level in India drew from the Economic Freedom of Indian states, 2011 (Debroy et al., 2011) report which covers the years 2005, 2007 and 2009. The index used for economic freedom in India was derived from three key indicators - size of government, legal structure and property rights protection, and business and labor regulation. The study focused on 20 states as data for those states were available.",0
59,12,"The Economic Freedom of the World Report by the Fraser Institute serves as the basis for the areas used to construct India's economic freedom index, ensuring the comparability of measures with those of other countries. However, due to India's specific conditions and division of responsibilities between the states and the central government, only three dimensions are deemed appropriate for the index. These dimensions allow state governments to directly impact economic conditions and institutions. The rating scale ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 representing the highest degree of economic freedom. Per capita gross state domestic product (GSDP) and GSDP growth rate are used to measure the impact of economic freedom on economic growth, with data collected from the Central Statistical Office (CSO) of the government of India.",0
59,13,"The study focuses on the economic freedom index rather than its change, although examining the latter may have been more beneficial. Unfortunately, data for the freedom index in the Indian context is only available for three years, and analyzing changes would reduce the data period to two, thereby decreasing the number of observations. Previous research has also concentrated on the level of economic freedom rather than the change. Based on prior empirical evidence, the study assumes that economic freedom affects growth, but not the other way around. No endogeneity testing is conducted in the proposed linear multiple regression model.",0
59,14,"Higher rates of economic growth are linked to greater levels of economic freedom. This connection could be explained by the ""productivity effect,"" which is related to the fact that many of the freedom index variables are measures of price distortion that impact the allocation of resources and efficiency. As a result, economic freedom has positive impacts on economic growth, as noted by Cole in 2005.",0
59,15,"It could be suggested that a smaller government, improved legal provisions and property rights security, and increased flexibility and state intervention in credit, labour market and business will lead to higher economic growth in India. According to Solow-Swan and Ramsey's neoclassical growth models, a higher value of the rule of law indicator will elevate the steady-state level of output per effective worker, and a higher ratio of government consumption to GDP will lower it, which reduces the growth rate. In the former case, the growth rate will rise, while in the latter, it will decrease, given values. (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004).",0
59,16,"The level of economic freedom is decreased when the government interferes with the economy by producing and providing goods and services or redistributing resources. As government expenditure increases, it may lead to distortions in private decision-making and have adverse effects on public finance. Economic freedom is meant to encompass the idea that the government's role in a free economy is only to provide protective and productive functions. When the government goes beyond these functions and transfers resources between taxpayers, it is seen as impinging on economic freedom. Essentially, a small government size is needed to increase economic freedom, while a large size reflects more resource reallocation and intrusion into the private market which may lower freedom. In creating the freedom index, the non-linear relationship between government size and economic freedom was considered.",0
59,17,"Flexibility within the labor market is crucial for achieving success in any business venture. This trait highlights an entrepreneur's ability to adapt to changes necessary for the growth of their enterprise (Altman, 2007). Offering entrepreneurs the liberty to streamline their labor base and depart from the market can also bolster their abilities. Obstacles such as limited infrastructure and raw materials may impede entrepreneurs and lead to their failures (Debroy et al., 2011).</Mask>",0
59,18,"There may be uncertainties in the money market due to volatility, which is indicated by inflation and macroeconomic instability. The role of inflation in output growth is a subject of conflicting views, with the ""grease effect"" and ""sand effect"" creating different effects. While developed countries exhibit a predominant grease effect, developing countries show a significant sand effect. High inflation rates may lead to inefficient allocation of resources, decreasing real net return on investment and resulting in a decline in investment and economic growth in the long run. On the other hand, favorable impacts of inflation due to money acting as a capital substitute cannot be overlooked. Hence, the impact of inflation on economic growth remains an empirical question.",0
59,19,"The significance of the economy's structure in relation to economic growth cannot be overlooked. The industry mix, which is reflected in the sectoral composition, is a useful indicator in this regard. Structural changes that favor fast-growing sectors may enhance growth and per capita income. While previous studies have investigated the role of services in compositional effects, in the Indian economy, the fast-growing service sector and manufacturing sector, which is an employment-generating sector, play significant roles. Two independent factors, the shares of employment for the secondary and tertiary sectors, are used to understand compositional effects. However, the expected sign of each variable is unclear and dependent on the relative size of each sector and employment dynamics in all other sectors. Therefore, the impact of shares of industry and services on growth in India remains an empirical question.",0
59,20,"Investing in human capital is another key factor that drives economic growth. Studies show that increasing investment in human capital can lead to higher growth rates until reaching a steady state. Human capital can help overcome the constraint of diminishing returns to physical capital and generate long-term per capita growth without the need for technological progress. Therefore, producing human capital can serve as an alternative to improving technology to drive long-term growth. The growth rates are affected by the balance between human and physical capital, with abundance of human capital relative to physical capital resulting in higher growth rates. In times of crisis, recovery is faster if physical capital is destroyed rather than human capital. A country with greater availability of human capital can adopt sophisticated techniques at a lower cost and achieve higher returns.",0
59,21,"Since 1991, India has implemented various liberalization measures that can be categorized into two phases, commonly known as first and second generation reforms. The first phase mainly focused on external sector reforms introduced by the central government, while the second phase emphasized domestic economic reforms that primarily fall under the purview of the state government. First generation reforms also included product market agendas, while second-generation reforms primarily addressed the markets for land and labor. This information was sourced from Jha in 2009 and Debroy et al. in 2011.",0
59,22,"The scores of economic freedom have significantly improved over time due to the reforms, with values increasing from 5.1 in 1990 to 6.4 in 2008 (Table 1). All individual indicators of economic freedom, except for 'access to sound money,' have constantly improved. These indices measure the extent of freedom from government-imposed restrictions on various pertinent aspects (Debroy et al. 2011). It is intriguing to note these changes.",0
59,23,"It is evident that India, being a vast country, showcases distinct contrasts among its constituent states, primarily owing to their differing social, political, and institutional frameworks. Thus, the current national scenario may not accurately reflect the individual state's conditions. Additionally, the implementation of economic reform policies has not been uniform across all states. While some states embraced the reform agendas with fervor, others have been sluggish in their adoption. Consequently, certain states enjoy greater economic freedom and growth rates than others. Therefore, studies on economic freedom and growth must concentrate on these inter-state differences.",0
59,24,"The study focuses on economic freedom and its indices as important variables. Table 2 displays the impact of overall economic freedom on economic growth, reflected in column 1. A positive and significant correlation exists between the overall economic freedom index and economic growth across the states, suggesting that higher levels of economic freedom lead to better economic growth.",0
59,25,"The second, third, and fourth columns of Table 2 illustrate the economic freedom indices for three different components. The economic freedom index for the size of government suggests that reduced government intervention, indicating a higher level of economic freedom, may lead to increased economic growth. The coefficient for this index is positive and significant, showing that states with smaller government spending as a share of the total, less government enterprise sector, and lower marginal tax rates are likely to achieve greater economic growth. Additionally, the legal structure and security of property rights coefficient is positive and significant, suggesting that ensuring law and order and protecting property is a vital area of governance. The regulation of labor and business directly affects economic growth, with this aspect of economic freedom reflecting state intervention in labor markets, bureaucratic and procedural costs, including physical infrastructure. It may be said that high flexibility in the labor market enhances output growth. The three economic freedom indices are also tested simultaneously to check the model's robustness (Table 2, column 5), and the results are generally consistent.",0
59,26,"India's per capita income growth is directly impacted by the share of employment in the tertiary sector. However, the secondary sector's share appears to be irrelevant. The reason for including both sectors in the growth model is to analyze the compositional effects of people transitioning from low-productive agriculture to high-productive secondary and tertiary sectors. Currently, India's growth is largely due to the growth of the tertiary sector, evidenced by its increasing share in the country's GDP. This growth is led by information and communication technology, highlighting ICT's pivotal role in India's growth.",0
59,27,"The role of literacy rate, as a measure of human capital, in determining economic growth is significant. The positive coefficient of the initial literacy rate suggests that states with a stronger human capital base at the beginning are more likely to experience higher growth rates. It implies that human capital can complement physical capital, thereby delaying the onset of diminishing returns to reproducible capital, according to Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991).",0
59,28,"It is interesting to note that the per capita income growth rate of Indian states is positively correlated with their initial levels of per capita income. This implies that states with higher initial per capita incomes tend to grow faster compared to their counterparts with lower per capita incomes, corroborating Rao et al.'s findings. This finding contradicts the neoclassical growth theory's prediction of diminishing returns to reproducible capital, as proposed by Solow in 1956. Instead, the results suggest an increase in returns to reproducible capital and a widening gap in economic growth between the Indian states (Rao et al. 1999).",0
59,29,"The data shows that economic freedom contributes positively to India's economic growth. It is interesting to note that all three aspects of economic freedom are important for the states of India. Therefore, it would be wise for the country and its regions to reduce the government's size and interference in the market, as well as to have flexible regulations for credit, labor, and product markets. Moreover, strengthening the legal structure would create a more business-friendly atmosphere throughout India's states, fostering growth.",0
60,1,"The influence of economic freedom and culture on economic growth is discussed in this paper, with the argument that both factors play a crucial role in determining economic prosperity. The study used the World Values Surveys to measure culture and found that economic institutions associated with economic freedom were also essential for growth. It was discovered that economic freedom had a more significant impact, indicating that culture and economic freedom could substitute or complement each other. The paper further suggests that culture becomes more important for growth when economic freedom is lacking and reduces in significance when economic freedom is established.",0
60,2,"Economic growth and development rely heavily on key economic institutions, such as private property, the rule of law, and contract enforcement. North (1990) defines institutions as the ""rules of the game,"" which are manifested in both formal (codified structures) and informal (cultures, norms, and conventions enforced by social custom) ways. While economists acknowledge the importance of both formal and informal institutions for growth and development, the relative impact of each remains uncertain. Therefore, we argue that both economic institutions and culture must be taken into account when analyzing economic growth.",0
60,3,"The objective of this research is to integrate 'cultural capital' into the freedom-growth framework and contribute to understanding how institutions impact economic development. By controlling for economic institutions and culture, the study separates and evaluates their individual effects on economic outcomes. The analysis sheds light on whether economic freedom and culture complement or substitute each other, with a major emphasis on their relative effects on economic prosperity rather than their feedback or interaction.",0
60,4,"Using a fixed effects model from 1970 to 2004 and including various robustness checks, we found that culture and economic freedom both play a role in economic prosperity. However, when considering both factors simultaneously, the relationship between culture and growth weakens, while economic freedom continues to have a positive and highly significant impact on economic growth. This suggests that culture and economic freedom may act as substitutes, with culture providing key institutional functions in the absence of economic freedom, but becoming less necessary with credible economic institutions.",0
60,5,"The literature has extensively scrutinized the strong correlation between economic freedom and growth, as mentioned earlier. The theoretical fundamentals supporting this connection are also firmly established. De Haan and Sturm (2000: 3) state that economists and economic historians have been advocating that the freedom to choose and supply resources, competition in business, trade with others, and secure property rights are crucial factors in advancing the economy, ever since the era of Adam Smith, if not before.",0
60,6,"To deepen our understanding of how culture impacts economic growth, we limit our scope to a particular set of cultural indicators that are deemed significant for economic interactions and transactions. Referred to as 'economic culture,' this subset is defined by Porter (2000: 14) as ""the convictions, attitudes, and principles that shape the economic behavior of individuals, organizations, and other institutions."" This focused approach facilitates a more detailed examination of the correlation between culture and economic growth (Patterson 2000).",0
60,7,"The variable for our economic culture is based on the methodology outlined in Tabellini (2008a, 2009). It identifies four categories of culture that should influence behavior related to social and economic interaction, thereby affecting economic growth and development. These categories are trust, respect, individual self-determination, and obedience, all of which govern interaction between individuals in markets and entrepreneurship. Trust, respect, and individual self-determination encourage economic interaction, while obedience constrains it by reducing risk-taking, which is crucial to entrepreneurship.",0
60,8,"Self-determination is a way of measuring the level of control individuals have over their lives and their choices. If an individual has a high level of self-determination, they are more likely to see economic success or failure as a result of their own efforts. This motivates them to work harder and increase their productivity, ultimately leading to an increase in their overall welfare. Banfield (1958) argues that the greater an individual¡¯s ¡®locus of control,¡¯ the higher the economic development of their country will be.",0
60,9,"The correlation between culture and economic freedom can work in either direction, as substitutes or complements. Economic growth is influenced by both culture and economic freedom. If one of them surpasses the other in significance when included in the same regression, they can be considered as substitutes. However, if both remain significant, it suggests that culture and freedom are complementing each other to promote economic growth.",0
60,10,"The formalization of informal institutions associated with economic freedom in a culture may promote economic growth. As a result, informal norms and mechanisms like trust networks may no longer be necessary. In this scenario, economic freedom becomes more important than culture in the growth regression, indicating a substitution effect.",0
60,11,"The argument for considering culture and economic freedom as complementary and important factors in growth regression is strong. While each factor may contribute to economic growth independently, their combined impact is likely to be much stronger than either alone. For instance, a trusting culture can facilitate some exchanges, but the enforcement of laws on property rights and against predation by a government is essential for sustainable economic growth. A number of studies have suggested that culture and economic freedom mutually reinforce each other, supporting this argument (references omitted).",0
60,12,"We use the Economic Freedom of the World Index developed by the Fraser Institute to measure economic freedom. The index rates the level of economic freedom from zero to ten, with ten being the highest, based on 42 different components that can be classified into five main groups. These groups are the size of government, monetary policy and price stability, legal structure and security of private ownership, freedom to trade with foreigners, and regulation of credit, labor, and business. Each of these categories contains a subset of variables used to create the overall index of economic freedom.",0
60,13,"We have included the investment share as one of our standard control variables due to the well-established positive correlation between the rate of investment in physical capital and the rate of growth (Levine and Renelt 1992). However, we acknowledge that including both economic freedom and the investment rate in the same regression may lead to an endogeneity problem, as pointed out by De Haan et al. (2006). Numerous studies demonstrate that economic freedom enhances growth both directly through a productivity-promoting channel and indirectly through an investment effect (Dawson 1998; Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles 2003; Gwartney et al. 2004). Although we include investment in our primary specification, we address the endogeneity issue in a later section.",0
60,14,"The third column of the regressions combines culture and economic freedom to differentiate between the substitutability and complementarity of the two variables. In the OLS regression, the significance of culture disappears when controlling for economic freedom. However, in the fixed effects regression, culture is significant at the 10% level. Economic freedom remains strongly and positively significant in both specifications. The joint significance of the F-statistics from all three columns is highest when controlling for both culture and freedom. The results support the idea that economic freedom is a stronger contributor to economic performance than culture.",0
60,15,"The insignificance of culture is observed in all five regression specifications, whereas economic freedom is found to have a positive and significant impact at the 99% level, further supporting the substitution theory. According to regression (1), a one unit increase in the freedom index leads to an increase in growth by 1.40 percentage points. When controlling for educational attainment, the coefficient on freedom almost doubles and the R-squareds go from 0.28 to 0.93, indicating severe endogeneity. Education has a strong positive and significant relationship with growth, while all other variables, except for culture, are also significant in this specification. Investment, population growth, and area are significant only in this regression while urban population is significant in three out of four regressions, albeit with a switch in signs. Geography and legal origin turn out to be insignificant.",0
60,16,"Despite the fact that the extra control variables do not provide much explanation to the model, as implied by the comparable R-squareds to the baseline specification (except for education), we acknowledge that our model only accounts for roughly 25% of the variance in growth. We attribute this to our prudent handling of our control variables.",0
60,17,"Based on our benchmark and core analysis, it appears that culture and economic freedom could act as substitutes. Our findings indicate that economic institutions that uphold private property rights, the rule of law, and contract enforcement play a significant role in determining economic growth. This outcome is consistent across various regression models. Although we observe a slight positive link between culture and economic growth, our analysis shows that culture only has a statistically significant impact in one of the seven regressions when we control for economic freedom. This outcome seems to support the substitution hypothesis and suggests that the relationship between culture and economic growth may be more complex than previously believed.",0
60,18,"To test reverse causality more directly, we conduct a simple check that involves the use of both lagged and future values of changes in freedom, changes in culture, and our growth rate. If our results are being driven by reverse causality, we anticipate that changes in income will subsequently result in changes in freedom and culture, or both. However, if freedom or culture is contributing to growth, then we expect changes in these variables to be correlated with growth in the following period. Consequently, we examine changes in these variables, not their levels, for this specification only.",0
61,1,"The article highlights that extreme economic inequality is not only a violation of social justice, but also a dysfunction to the U.S. economy and a factor linked to the recent economic crisis. The changes in ideology, market economy, and government policies since the mid-1970s are identified and contrasted with the preceding post-World War II decades. The analysis reveals how increased economic inequality and political consequences contributed to the economic meltdown, which had devastating effects, particularly on the social work clientele. The article has implications for social reform and calls for social movements to broaden the constituency of social justice in pursuit of reducing economic and political inequality. It also explores the ways social workers can contribute to such movements.",0
61,2,"During the period of 65 years following World War II, economic inequality can be divided into two parts. The first three decades saw a decline in inequality, whereas the next 30 years saw the rise of inequality, leading to an economic crisis. The article focuses on the differences between the two periods in terms of income and wealth distribution, wages, unemployment, and poverty. It then elaborates on the democratic system of government's relationship with capitalism during the first period, in which a concept of ""new capitalism"" emerged, characterized by the national income's rise benefiting individuals who were previously unable to share in the prosperity through their earnings. During this time, efforts were also made towards the conscious pursuit of full employment, which aided in the earning of higher incomes. This era, seen retrospectively, may have been an anomaly in the history of capitalism, resulting from the federal government's active role in the economy in response to the Great Depression and World War II's incredibly exceptional events in the United States.",0
61,3,"It's not surprising that economic inequality has increased over the past 30 years, but the extent of the divide can still be shocking. Inequality is evident in numerous areas, including wages, income, wealth, poverty, and unemployment.",0
61,4,"The income gains of the top 1 percent of households are particularly outrageous and disproportionate. In 2007, just before the financial collapse, the average after-tax income of these wealthiest Americans was $1,319,700, which is an increase of $976,120 over the 1979 average. This is a stark comparison to the middle and bottom quintiles, who only saw increases of $11,200 and $2,400, respectively. Analyzing data from the CBO, Sherman and Stone of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities discovered that after-tax income gaps between the richest 1 percent and the middle and poorest fifth of the country increased more than threefold between 1979 and 2007. The data suggests that income concentration at the top of the income scale has reached levels not seen since 1928, the eve of our previous, catastrophic financial crash.",0
61,5,"Wealth is highly skewed towards the top and has experienced a recent surge in concentration. From 1995 to 2004, just about all of the gains in household net wealth went to the highest quartile of income earners. In 2004, the wealthiest 10% possessed over 70% of private wealth. Edward Wolff, a renowned scholar in the field, authored a study entitled Top Heavy to describe the mounting inequality in wealth in the United States.",0
61,6,"Unemployment was relatively low during the period of shared prosperity, with an average of 4.8 percent from 1949 to 1973, compared to an average of 6.5 percent from 1974 to 2008, which has led to stagnant wages in times of high unemployment. This not only results in lost income and increasing inequality but also leads to the loss of potential output for the economy. Conversely, when the labor market tightens, wages and benefits rise, particularly for low-wage workers, as seen in the 1990s. The impact of unemployment is not limited to reduced incomes and tax revenues but also contributes to government budget deficits through increased outlays to benefit jobless workers.",0
61,7,"During the Great Depression and World War II, the government took on a more active role in the economy, resulting in a larger and more involved government. By enacting policies that reduced the severity of recessions and distributed income more equitably, the government became more accepted by Americans. The expansion of social welfare programs, particularly unemployment compensation, helped stabilize the economy during times of economic downturn by reducing the contraction of consumer spending. The government also implemented regulatory policies to prevent another stock market crash and maintained higher tax rates in peacetime to support rising real wages and labor peace. Despite criticisms of violating free-market economics, economist Robert Kuttner argued that this system produced nearly 30 years of egalitarian economic growth at an average annual rate of 3.8%, highlighting its benefits.",0
61,8,"Instead of investing in productivity and innovation to reduce their competitive disadvantage, businesses opted for alternative strategies that increased inequality (Harrison & Bluestone, 1985). This included squeezing labor through wage freezes and flexible work arrangements, globalization through transferring operations to lower-wage countries, and abandoning production for paper profits resulting in job losses. Companies like General Electric and General Motors shifted their focus to more profitable financial services. Another strategy was lobbying for tax and regulation reductions.",0
61,9,"In 1980, the Republicans successfully brought together their fiscally conservative, pro-business base with a group of the Democrats' New Deal coalition. These voters were turning away from the Democratic party due to issues like affirmative action, expanded welfare, school busing, women's liberation, gay rights, abortion, and high taxes. Former Democratic supporters, including blue-collar workers, felt that the party no longer represented their interests and prosperity. This was noted by Edsall (1991).",0
61,10,"Despite projecting a progressive and populist image, Democrat Bill Clinton oversaw the elimination of AFDC and the GlassSteagall Act, a key New Deal banking regulation. This repeal allowed for the merging of commercial and investment banks and the continuation of high-risk investment practices. Clinton also maintained Republican policies of globalization, neglecting workers' rights and environmental protection.",0
61,11,"President-elect Bill Clinton's abandonment of his campaign promise to prioritize the needs of the people over the financial sector highlighted the influence of the latter. Despite pledging to create an economy that prioritized the well-being of ordinary citizens, Clinton acknowledged that the wealthy controlled the economy and that lowering deficits would benefit bondholders but harm his supporters. Robert Rubin, a co-senior partner at Goldman Sachs and a member of Clinton's National Economic Council and Treasury Secretary, was among the advisors who advised the president-elect to prioritize deficit reduction.",0

This ""nexus of factors"" gave rise to specific developments such as the increase in credit, the lack of regulation, and the housing bubble, which will be examined in more detail later.",0
61,13,"In the United States, the increasing ""media monopoly"" contributed to a limitation on the spectrum of viewpoints available to the public. Between 1983 and 2004, there was a drastic decrease in the number of corporations controlling most of the newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations, book publishers, and movie companies, from 50 to just five. The nonprofit organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) noted that mergers in the news industry had accelerated, further narrowing the range of perspectives that could access mass media. Ultimately, the views expressed by the media were heavily influenced by the agendas of their owners.",0

Various countries are less apprehensive about ""big government."" Research indicates that wealthy capitalist countries differ significantly in poverty prevention and the size and scope of their welfare states. Even though most welfare states have faced cutbacks in recent years, the relative poverty rates across countries vary widely. For example, in 2000, France and Germany had poverty rates of 7.3% and 8.4%, respectively, while the United States had a poverty rate of 17.0%. The United Kingdom and Canada had lower poverty rates of 13.7% and 12.4%, respectively, compared to the U.S. Several countries like the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden had even lower rates, which ranged from 5.4% to 6.6%.

However, these financial instruments were central to the housing bubble, its inevitable collapse, and the subsequent financial bailouts. Banks purchased credit-default swaps, a derivative that insured mortgage loan packages, in an attempt to minimize their risk. Since insurance was heavily regulated, these packages were named ""credit default swaps"" to avoid further regulation. Nearly a decade prior, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission suggested regulating these derivatives, but notable figures such as Clinton's Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, his Deputy Lawrence Summers and Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, strongly opposed regulation.",0

61,17,"Job creation similar to the New Deal work programs designed by social workers Harry Hopkins and Aubrey Williams requires improvement as women and minorities were not employed according to their needs. To enhance the New Deal model, it is crucial to emphasize job opportunities in social fields like child and elder care, education, and health care, coupled with physical infrastructure. A new industrial policy promoting U.S. manufacturing could boost job opportunities and reduce reliance on the financial sector. However, these modifications require significant participation from the federal government. (Rose, 2010; Pollin & Baker, 2009).",0

Despite the global financial crisis caused by their failures, the money changers remain in the temple. The stock market may have recovered, but unemployment remained high for months. Financial interests are opposed to reregulation, and lobby heavily to weaken regulatory reform. However, Congress enacted the first regulatory legislation in a generation with a powerful consumer protection component. The effectiveness of the new law will ultimately depend on successful implementation, which financial interests are actively lobbying against. (Johnson & Kwak, 2010) (Lichtblau, 2010)",0
61,19,"Social workers have historically focused more on welfare than job creation, despite some involvement in government job creation in the 1930s. However, with the ongoing issue of unemployment and its far-reaching effects, social workers can play a role in reducing inequality by supporting organizations that advocate for direct job creation by the government. They can also support living wage campaigns and the strengthening of the labor movement, including advocating for the Employee Free Choice Act of 2009, and by joining unions themselves to advocate for reforms that benefit all workers.",0
61,20,"The fact that many families with incomes above the median, including social workers, struggle to afford basic necessities highlights the high cost of living. These families are consequently at risk of falling prey to predatory lending. It begs the question, who is responsible for safeguarding them against these financial predators? In the past, settlements took up this task and advocated for consumer protection and regulatory laws. Therefore, social workers not only need to educate consumers about financial literacy but also push for the enforcement of new consumer protection laws.",0
62,1,"In 2001, Greece became a part of the Eurozone and experienced a brief period of economic prosperity before facing a major financial crisis in 2010. The economic situation transformed drastically between the country's entry into the Eurozone and their acceptance of a shared IMF/EU rescue package. To test the economic voting theory, I utilize this scenario. I examine the relations between macroeconomic indicators and the incumbent party's vote share, as well as sociotropic assessments of the state of the economy and support for the incumbent party, using longitudinal aggregation data from 1981 to 2009 and individual-level data from 2004 to 2009. The findings reveal that sociotropic economic assessments are linked to government party backing, but when the economy is at its worst, the incumbent has little chance of victory and should only anticipate support from long-time loyalists.",0
62,2,"The Greek economy faced its most difficult period in recent times in 2009, which has since made news headlines worldwide. This unexpected development came following Greece's acceptance into the Eurozone alongside its booming economic activity and falling unemployment rates in the early 2000s. The conservative ND party's win in the 2004 election ended PASOK's eleven-year rule and exposed signs of corruption in the government, prompting Karamanlis to promise reform and fight against corruption.",0
62,3,"In 2009, Greece was facing a serious problem as its debt and budget deficit had reached an alarming level. Prime Minister Karamanlis decided to hold a snap election due to the difficulties facing his government in handling the effects of the global recession, as well as a series of scandals that led to the resignation of three ministers within a year. During the electoral campaign, Karamanlis refrained from making promises regarding the economic policy his party would follow, and instead presented himself as sincere about the actual economic situation of the country, attributing it to the global financial crisis. However, despite his efforts, PASOK won the election comfortably, with the justification that the economy had not been managed well by the previous government.",0
62,4,"Voters are not considered fools and they make rational judgments about the past performance of the economy, according to the idea of economic voting. Although prospective evaluations are relevant, they are not as easy as reminiscing. Voters' perceptions and appraisals of policy and performance are driving forces behind their decisions, argued Key. Fiorina extended Key's argument about retrospective evaluations. Even uninformed voters have a hard bit of data - what life has been like during the incumbent's administration. Based on such evaluations, voters can hold the government accountable by rewarding and re-electing it or punishing it and voting for the opposition.",0
62,5,"There is limited knowledge on economic voting in Greece, and the existing research is based on a comparative study by Freire and Costa Lobo (2005) and their analysis of the effect of objective and subjective economic indicators on voting behavior in Greece, Portugal, and Spain from 1984 to 1999. Their findings suggest that in Greece, personal financial perceptions correlate with GDP changes. Additionally, the authors used Eurobarometer data to examine the importance of the economy on party choice from 1985 to 2000 and found that ideology was the most significant factor. However, there is a need for empirical testing of economic evaluations for recent elections, which will require examining aggregate as well as individual-level data.",0
62,6,"Macro performance is connected to support for the current party via the reward-punishment hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that voters evaluate a government's economic performance based on major indicators, such as unemployment and inflation, and then reward or punish the current party based on these evaluations. Essentially, the government is held accountable for its economic policy decisions. Opposing political parties can also gain support if voters deem the incumbent party's performance inadequate. This concept was discussed by Sanders in 2000 and previously by Lewis-Beck in 1988 and Powell and Whitten in 1993.",0
62,7,"Research on German and British data corroborates Mueller's theory that voters only respond to economic circumstances when they experience a sudden downturn (referencing Nannestad and Paldam, 1997, p.85). However, can this hypothesis be applied to individual-level analysis? Previous attempts to test the ""grievance hypothesis"" at the individual level (as cited in Kiewiet, 1983 and Lewis-Beck, 1988) have been unsuccessful except for when examining the Danish electorate (Nannestad and Paldam, 1997). In contrast, a study conducted by van der Brug et al. (2007) found evidence supporting the ""grievance asymmetry"" hypothesis which posits that economic voting depends on the direction of economic change. These authors had a more liberal definition of what constituted an asymmetry, which resulted in substantial variations in the impact between improving and deteriorating economic conditions (van der Brug et al., 2007, pp. 142-159).",0
62,8,"In Greece, previous simulations at the individual level regarding the effects of economic changes on elections showed that voters tended to reward the governing party when the economy improved, with rewards being slightly stronger than punishments. The lack of coalition governments in Greece makes it a high-clarity country, as voters can easily identify the party accountable for government policies. Stable single-party governments have been a characteristic of Greece's party system, partly due to the disproportional electoral system, known as ""reinforced proportional representation,"" which has been modified multiple times since democracy was restored in 1974. With the exception of the quasi-caretaker coalition governments of 1989-1990, ND and PASOK have taken turns in government, while all other parties remained in opposition.",0
62,9,"The scatterplots depicted in Fig. 1 (with bandwidth 0.7) display a rather mixed outlook, with some evidence suggesting an asymmetry between the fluctuations in the state of the economy and the vote share for the ruling party. Upon closer examination of each macroeconomic indicator separately, it can be observed that declines in the GDP are linked to declines in the incumbent party's vote share and vice versa, but there seems to be a threshold at 2.5% change where incumbents are no longer rewarded for improving growth indicators. With regard to inflation, it appears that increases in the inflation rate up to around 17% are not associated with a decline in the incumbent vote share; voters are, in fact, slightly rewarding the party. However, after this threshold, there is a substantial decline in the vote share for the incumbent. The same is true for changes in the unemployment rate, where alterations between ?1% and 1% do not seem to impact the incumbent vote share. But there is a steep decline in the vote share for the incumbents after the threshold, indicating a punishment for them, although there are very few observations beyond this point.",0
62,10,"I conducted a logistic regression analysis to understand how economic variables impact support for the incumbent party. The dependent variable was coded as 1 if the respondent intended to vote for the incumbent party and 0 if they intended to vote for any other party at the opposition, based on previous studies (Lewis-Beck and Nadeau, 2000; Evans and Andersen, 2006). Logistic regression allowed me to estimate the probability of a voter selecting the incumbent party and how this probability changed with changing economic perceptions. However, in line with most studies, vote choice was considered a function of temporary effects such as economic evaluations, long-term effects such as party identification and ideology, and demographics such as age and gender (Clarke et al., 2004).",0
62,11,"Fig. 2 indicates that the percentage of voters who negatively evaluated the economy increased by almost 20% when comparing the 2004 and 2009 elections. In 2004, which was five years before the economic crisis, 24.4% of voters evaluated the economy as a lot worse. In 2009, a few months before Greece agreed to a bailout package with the IMF/EU, this percentage increased to 43.9%. However, for economic considerations to play an important role in voters' decision-making, the economy must be a salient issue for them. Issue salience was measured in both surveys by an open-ended question asking respondents to name the most important problem facing the country, with the option to mention up to two issues in 2004 and three in 2009. For both elections, economic issues were by far the most significant in voters' minds, with the Greek public mentioning the economy in general, inflation and unemployment in particular, as the most critical issues. There was a significant increase in the importance of the economy from 2004 to 2009, followed by a decrease in the significance of unemployment as an issue.",0
62,12,"Table 1 presents the findings of the study. The economic variable coefficients are statistically significant and aligned with the initial hypothesis. In the 2004 election, voters identifying with the left side of the ideological spectrum showed more support for the socialist governing party, PASOK, as did those who believed that the economic situation had improved in the previous year and those who identified with the incumbent. None of the sociodemographic factors were found to have a significant impact. Similar patterns were observed in the 2009 election. Those who held a favorable view of the economy were more likely to vote for the incumbent, which happened to be the conservative ND. As a result, voters on the right side of the political spectrum also inclined towards ND. These results suggest that economic assessments have a significant bearing on support for the incumbent party. Despite the favorable performance of the economy in 2004, retrospective evaluations of the economic situation correlated with support for the incumbent.",0
62,13,"It is challenging to address endogeneity in cross-sectional data regression models since we lack suitable exogenous instruments. Instead, a counterfactual argument is offered: if we consider endogeneity as an omitted variable problem, we must assess the effect size of this variable to nullify the results presented in Table 1. Considering the powerful predictors included in the model (party identification and left-right self-placement), it is hard to imagine another explanatory variable that could predict incumbent party support with an odds ratio of at least 1.8.3. Thus, we can safely assert that while economic evaluations' impact on support for the incumbent might be overestimated, such an effect undoubtedly exists.",0
62,14,"The article aims to analyze the correlation between the economy and voting behavior in Greece during the 2004 and 2009 elections, with a focus on how it affects support for incumbent parties. The research suggests that, similar to other countries, the Greek electorate tends to punish the ruling party during economic downturns rather than reward them for improvements. However, the non-parametric methods used limit the ability to draw definite conclusions. A multilevel analysis that considers individual-level covariates indicates that rewards are equally as likely as punishments in Greece. While there is a lack of Greek electoral data, future research should continue to examine the concept of ""grievance asymmetry.""",0
62,15,"The probability of voting for the incumbent party increases as positive evaluations about the economy increase, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. However, confidence intervals between adjacent plots for different levels of evaluation overlap, indicating that any changes in mean evaluations among the electorate would not significantly impact the probability to vote for the incumbent party, with the exception of the shift from ""much worse"" to ""much better"" evaluations in 2004. Figs. 4 and 5 also suggest that the position of the party on the Left-Right scale may affect the gain from positive evaluations about the economy. The centrist position of PASOK allows it to make gains across the ideological spectrum, but right-wing ND faces uncertainty when trying to gain support from the left. The expert surveys used in this study include the 2003 Benoit and Laver (2006) survey for the 2004 election and the Vowles and Xezonakis (2009) survey for the 2009 election.",0
62,16,"The results do not suggest that there was no economic voting in 2009. Economic evaluations did have an important role in both elections, but the evidence from Figs. 4 and 5 shows that this role did not have a substantial impact on electoral returns for the party in government. This was particularly evident in the parliamentary election of October 2009, where the high odds ratio for party identification in Table 1 indicated that only the most loyal supporters of the conservatives intended to vote for the incumbent ND. Ultimately, this resulted in the worst electoral result for ND in its 35-year history.",0
63,1,"The literature on economic voting demonstrates that successful economic performance improves the chances of incumbents being re-elected. However, there is still disagreement as to whether voters in economically insecure situations are more inclined to cast economic votes. This article suggests that the degree of exposure to economic risks is a significant factor in explaining individual-level discrepancies in economic voting, as the level of risk exposure determines the importance of the economy in voting choices. The article focuses on job insecurity and employability as crucial factors in economic voting patterns. It postulates that voters who are more vulnerable to unemployment and have fewer employment prospects in the event of job loss are more likely to engage in economic voting. The test, which employed a dataset combining survey data on incumbent support with occupational unemployment rates and other exposure measures to economic risks, corroborated the hypotheses.",0
63,2,"The relationship between economic factors and electoral outcomes has been extensively researched in political science. Despite some areas of debate, the idea that macroeconomic performance is critical in democratic elections is now widely accepted by the general public and the media. However, recent years have seen challenges to this understanding in two areas: individual differences in information processing abilities and institutional factors that may affect economic voting. Studies have shown that individuals vary significantly in how they acquire information about the economy, while political institutions can affect how voters hold incumbents accountable for economic outcomes.",0
63,3,"This article presents two novel ways to advance economic voting literature and understand individual-level differences in voting behavior. Firstly, it incorporates political science literature to investigate the mediating factors between macroeconomic performance and incumbent support. Specifically, it explores the significance of 'skills' and professional job insecurity, which have been recognized as key sources of social policy preferences and welfare state arrangements. Secondly, it provides fresh empirical evidence that indicates how voters react to changes in macroeconomic performance based on their position in the labor market. The study shows that macroeconomic performance tends to be more critical to voters employed in professions that face higher risks of unemployment or rely on specific professional skills.",0
63,4,"In the upcoming section, an overview of the recent literature on economic voting is provided, focusing on the investigation of individual-level differences in economic risk exposure. A model of economic voting is then introduced, highlighting the importance of levels of exposure to the economic cycle in shaping voting behavior. Afterwards, this study shares the data used and details the research strategies employed in empirical testing. Lastly, the regression analysis results are discussed, followed by conclusions regarding possible directions for future research.",0
63,5,"In the study of economic voting, there has been reluctance to address the question of how individual economic conditions affect voting patterns. The economy is typically viewed as a 'valence issue', with all voters preferring a good economy. Scholars have primarily focused on responsibility attribution, assuming a lack of variation in economic performance's salience. Nevertheless, some classic studies, such as Hibbs (1977), have laid theoretical foundations for understanding how group differences in responsiveness to macroeconomic signals can shape economic voting patterns.",0
63,6,"This article makes two key contributions to the debate. Firstly, it advocates for a close integration of research into economic voting and literature on social policy preferences. The article argues that an individual's position in the labour market not only determines their preferences for social insurance but also shapes economic voting patterns. At a macro level, the resulting disparities in risk exposure generate significant differences in voting behaviour across occupational groups. Secondly, the article conducts the first empirical test of this argument using occupational unemployment data - a crucial concept in the discussion on social policy preferences and the welfare state's origins. Additionally, a range of alternative measures of risk exposure are presented for testing and verifying the study's results.",0
63,7,"The results from these significant articles indicate the need for a closer fusion of the economic voting literature and the knowledge from a different well-known branch of political science. Academic studies on the determinants of social policy preferences have offered extensive proof that the distribution of economic risks among the electorate is incredibly unequal. Such divergences are responsible for differences in choices concerning redistribution as well as in the macro-level welfare state arrangements. Two categories of individual-level aspects decide the exposure to the economic cycle of individual voters. One analysis highlights professional skills acquired through education and professional practices, which correlates positively with the degree of risk exposure. This is because employees with non-transferable skills are more prone to extended unemployment after a job loss. Another perspective proposes that job insecurity, instead of employability, is the primary factor that determines risk exposure. Industry association influences job security via various channels.",0
63,8,"The core principles of the economic voting model propose that there are two primary reasons for voters to be concerned with the macroeconomic state. Firstly, the success of the economy may be seen as valuable in its own right, and economic voting may follow a 'sociotropic' trend, in which voters support incumbents only if they have enhanced the financial well-being of their country as a whole (Kinder & Kiewiet 1981). Secondly, economic performance is also important because the future financial outcomes of individual voters depend, to some extent, on the country's economic health. For the argument outlined in this piece, it is vital to assume that economic voting is, at least in part, motivated by ¡®pocketbook¡¯ anxieties about the future implications of macroeconomic performance on an individual level. If voters didn't have concerns about how aggregate economic activity affects their personal finances, susceptibility to economic risk would not be a relevant factor in economic voting.",0
63,9,"To comprehend why this is so, we must examine a factor that has been significantly under-researched in the literature on economic voting - that is, the prominence of the economy and how it varies among the populace. This article assumes two critical hypotheses about the relationship between economic salience and voting behavior. Firstly, it assumes that voters have considerable cognitive limitations in how they receive and interpret information on specific political issues. This means that individuals, under different constraints, tend to consider only a few items from their broader spectrum of preferences while making decisions. Second, voters do not evaluate candidates based on their performance in all policy areas but only on those they consider of particular interest. Therefore, this is important for economic voting because although all voters may prefer a competent economic manager, some might prioritize other attributes of the candidate.",0
63,10,"The literature on economic voting has evolved to better understand the connection between macroeconomic performance and voting behavior. While economic voting is recognized as important, recent studies reveal differences among individuals and countries. Responsibility attribution and individual-level characteristics also influence economic voting. However, this article highlights an overlooked aspect - social policy preferences and welfare state development. Categorizing voters by their vulnerability to economic fluctuations can lead to a deeper understanding of economic voting. The analysis shows that voters with higher job insecurity are more likely to support incumbent governments with good macroeconomic performance.",0
63,11,"However, the positive findings presented in this study need to be considered in light of certain limitations of the research design. These limitations present opportunities for further research into the relationship between economic risk and economic voting. Firstly, the argument outlined in this article should be validated by analyzing actual voting data, as opposed to the measure of public opinion used in this study. Although the study has controlled for respondents who expressed the intention to vote, discrepancies between such intentions and actual voting behavior, including non-voting, have not been addressed. Secondly, the sample size is inadequate, as it is limited to a small number of advanced economies. By including a larger number of clusters in the sample, potential methodological issues in the estimations of standard errors for macro-level variables can be resolved, and interaction effects between cluster-level covariates can be investigated. Additionally, campaign-specific dynamics and political communication strategies, which were not examined in this study, are critical in determining the significance of the economy in electoral contests. Finally, the proposed causal mechanism was not verified through this study.",0
63,12,"Figure 3 depicts a visual presentation of the variation between the two groups by plotting two distinct curves that predict the probabilities of incumbent support based on GDP growth. The solid curve represents the low-skill respondents, which is noticeably steeper than the dashed curve that represents the high-skill respondents. This difference implies that macroeconomic fluctuations have a more significant impact on the support for the incumbent among low-skill respondents. For instance, during a terrible economic situation like a -1% growth, the predicted probability of incumbent support would decrease by 0.21 (from 0.45 to 0.24) for low-skill respondents while it would only reduce by 0.08 (from 0.39 to 0.31) for the high-skill group. Also, the chart reveals that the variation is more significant during economic crises than economic booms, which implies that the two groups vary more in their reluctance to penalize incumbents for poor economic governance than their enthusiasm to reward them for good performance.",0
63,13,"The models numbered 3 to 5 use different measures of job insecurity to estimate the model in Equation 3. Model 3 combines macroeconomic growth with a dummy variable to evaluate the impact of unemployment on economic conditions. The outcomes of the estimation reported in Table 2 reveal a positive coefficient for the interaction term, but it is not statistically significant in either the simple logistic or random effect model. Model 4 examines whether employment in the public sector provides job security, but the coefficient is positive and small, which is contrary to the expectations. This coefficient is nearly significant in the random effect model and insignificant in the simple regression model, demonstrating that there is no observable difference in economic voting behaviour between public and private sector employees. Finally, models 5 and 5r reveal that union membership is a significant factor in economic voting behaviour.",0
64,1,"The transformation process in Hungary from 1989 to 2004 is analyzed and evaluated in this paper. The paper's goal is to analyze the transformation process in Hungary, and the structure of the paper follows this general goal. The economic development of Hungary before the fall of the communist regime is analyzed first, as it determined the entire process that followed. Next, political development, which had a significant impact on the transformation process and its results, is briefly mentioned. The paper then focuses on the main steps in economic transformation, specifically on aspects such as privatization. Lastly, the main economic indicators of this period are analyzed. The conclusion drawn is that the transformation process met its main economic goal, with the economy's growth ability increased. However, the transformation process also created an environment for subsequent economic problems.",0
64,2,"The aim of this paper is to examine and assess Hungary's transformation process. According to the author's perspective, the primary objective of this transformation was to move from a centrally planned system to a market economy. We believe that this objective was generally accomplished with Hungary's accession to the EU, which is why we limit our analysis to the period up to 2004. This serves as indirect evidence that a functioning market economy had been established, as it was a requirement for accession. However, it is important to understand how this was achieved as other transforming countries continue to struggle. The second goal of the transformation process was to shift the overall trend of economic development. The centrally planned system was not sustainable, leading to a decline in economic growth, and Hungary was falling behind market economies. Without improving growth, any change in the economy would be meaningless. This paper evaluates the progress made towards achieving this objective.",0
64,3,"We will begin by outlining the political progress in Hungary over the long-term, which had an impact on the state of the Hungarian economy towards the end of the 1980s. This will be analyzed in the second chapter. Subsequently, we will focus on the political developments during the transformation era, which we consider to be the period between 1990 and 2004 (i.e. accession to the EU). We believe that the accession to the EU serves as evidence for the state of the Hungarian economy. The main economic developments will be analyzed in the following three chapters. We will focus on the sequence of reforms first and foremost, following which we will examine the process of privatization. These two chapters will provide an in-depth insight into the key economic steps taken. Finally, in the last chapter, we will summarize the economic results during the aforementioned period. Specific subchapters will delve into an analysis of economic growth, the economy's structure, inflation, unemployment, and external relationships.",0
64,4,"During the paper's development, we faced challenges regarding data. Specifically, we encountered issues with the duration of consistent data series as identifying relevant and uniform data that spanned the entire transformation period was incredibly arduous. This compelled us to use abbreviated series. We believe that the data we utilized are the most optimal that were obtainable.",0
64,5,"The main focus of this text is on Hungary's development during the transformation process. However, to fully understand the country's history, it is important to examine its broader perspective. Hungary's long-term economic development can be traced back to the aftermath of the First World War, when the country lost a significant portion of its land to neighbouring states. This event had a profound impact on the Hungarian populace, and the government's primary objective during the interwar years was to reunite all Hungarians under a single state. To this end, Hungary allied itself with fascist Germany in the 1930s, a move that was deemed necessary to achieve their goal.",0
64,6,"The relaxation of political tensions increased over time and resulted in the emergence of an opposition in the mid-1980s. Negotiations were held at the round table in 1989, which brought about a constitutional change to ensure a transition to democracy, market economy, human rights, and the prohibition of a single-party government (even when the party has a parliamentary majority). This change was ratified on October 23, 1989, and marked the beginning of a new democratic era for Hungary. The country avoided pseudo-democracy or national unity government, and went straight to democratic elections in March 1990.",0
64,7,"Political changes had an immediate effect on the growth of the Hungarian economy, which had a centrally planned system implemented after the Second World War. Although the system had some unique features in comparison to other centrally planned systems in the region, the backbone of the system was similar. The Hungarian system was generally not as stringent as that of Czechoslovakia, but significant differences arose as reforms were introduced after 1968.",0
64,8,"Hungary incorporated value added tax into the tax system in 1988, making it the first country in Central Europe to do so. By 1989, 63% of all prices had been liberalized. The forint underwent continuous devaluations, decreasing from 45.8 to USD in 1986 to 63.2 in 1990 (Vintrov¨¢, 1992).",0
64,9,"According to Bethkenhagen (1989), the private sector accounted for 3% of the national product in 1970. By 1989, this had increased to over 25% (Holman, 2000), and two-thirds of Hungarians had secondary income from private activities while being employed by a state company or a cooperative. Although significantly higher than Czechoslovakia's figures, these numbers are still far from reflecting a fully developed market economy.",0
64,10,"In Hungary during the communist reign, the economy experienced fluctuations in growth that were more pronounced than in Czechoslovakia. Although strong growth was achieved in the 1950s, this declined in subsequent decades to very low growth during the 1980s. Economic reforms did not lead to an improvement in the trend of economic growth, but instead resulted in worsening economic results. A figure provided in the text clearly shows this general trend.",0
64,11,"In March/April of 1990, the first free elections occurred. A central-right post-communist government was established by Jozsef Antall (1932-1993), consisting of Christian and national parties. With a parliamentary majority of 60%, the government enjoyed a secure position. One of its successes was the departure of Soviet forces from Hungary in 1991. Additionally, an association agreement with the European Community was signed that year.",0
64,12,"In 1994, the MSZP, a left wing party with post-communist roots, won elections by a large margin. However, due to economic difficulties, they had to implement stringent measures. The following election in 1998 resulted in a right wing coalition led by Fidesz and Hungary entered NATO. Fidesz secured a victory in 2002 but was unable to form a government, which was instead formed by left wing parties.",0
64,13,"Hungary generally upheld democratic principles throughout the entire period and joined the European Union in 2004. However, there has been a persistent dissatisfaction with the country's transformation process and overall quality of life. A survey conducted in 2006 revealed the extent of this dissatisfaction, as shown in the table below. While there is no clear explanation for this attitude, it may be attributed to the high expectations of Hungarians in the late 1980s and their general satisfaction with the semi-capitalist system of goulash communism.",0
64,14,"The discussion of reforms in Hungary during the transformation period was similar to that in other countries. However, the fact that the communist party had started reforms before the regime's fall made Hungary unique. Hungarians believed that radical reforms were not necessary, as they could achieve the same results with slower reforms. However, some proponents of shock therapy did not trust the government's ability to establish a market economy. The first period of Hungarian transformation is often described as gradualist, but there are debates over its definition. Some Hungarian measures, such as the bankruptcy law, were considered extremely radical. The second subchapter focuses on reforms that occurred in the mid-1990s, while the third subchapter concentrates on the period after the turn of the century.",0
64,15,"The Hungarian economy experienced macroeconomic imbalances, as previously stated. Laki (1993) identified three main tasks of the Antall government which included maintaining the country's creditworthiness, reducing inflation, and addressing the growing public deficit. However, reducing the public deficit was the most challenging task as the fall of the communist regime led to a decline in state income while the government struggled to decrease expenditures. Additionally, the government took on the responsibility of late state companies that provided social services to the public, resulting in further spending increases (Allen, Hass, 2001).",0
64,16,"The Hungarian government proceeded with reforms in the business and financial sectors alongside improvements to the legal system, privatization efforts, and antitrust policies. However, the tough new bankruptcy code implemented in 1992 challenged the efficacy of Hungarian gradualism, leading to 5,000 subjects going bankrupt and around 500 large companies being transferred into private ownership. While this privatization method negatively impacted affected banks due to the growing number of classified credits, the Czech Republic's bankruptcy legislation remained weaker during the same period, with the first law approved in 1993 only and not applicable to companies awaiting privatization.",0
64,17,"The economic performance of Hungary during this period was negative. Despite the country's approach of implementing gradual reforms, it could not prevent a transformation recession. Hungary experienced a comparable or more severe decline than other Central European nations, leading to a high unemployment rate. Unlike other countries after price liberalization, inflation did not exhibit a dramatic spike but stayed consistently high. However, the foreign capital inflow was relatively high due to the previous liberalization that had made foreign investors familiar with investing in Hungary. Nevertheless, the country faced a current account deficit.",0
64,18,"The purpose of taking these actions was clear; the government sought to decrease deficits in public finance and the trade balance while increasing competition in the economy. The outcomes of these policies were harsh, with government spending decreasing by 10% of GDP, real wages declining by 12% in 1995 and 4% in 1996, and economic growth slowing to just 1% in both years. However, the trade deficit decreased between 1994 and 1996, while the government deficit (excluding privatization income) dropped from 8.4% to 3%. The average deficit was relatively high at 5.5% of GDP between 1990 and 2004, with the results being the worst among Central European countries. The following figure illustrates the overall development of public finance during the first decade.",0
64,19,"After the implementation of the Bokros package, the economic development was viewed positively. However, this period of prosperity only lasted for a brief period, and Hungary encountered various challenges at the beginning of the new century. The government's expenditures were blamed for creating fiscal issues, with public sector wages increasing by 12-13% in 2002. The public finance deficit grew, as illustrated in the previous chart. Additionally, trade deficits increased, reaching 6-8% of GDP due to a decline in competitiveness caused by the escalating wages and slowdown of the European economies. This information is according to Gabrisch and H?lscher (2006).",0
64,20,"The central bank responded to lasting inflation pressures by implementing a monetary restriction, which included widening the fluctuation band in May 2001. The summer of that year saw the introduction of inflation targeting and the currency became fully convertible. In October, the crawling peg was abandoned and the central parity of the forint was fixed. Although the central bank shifted its focus to inflation targeting, the central parity and fluctuation zone remained in place. This meant that the central bank attempted to control both inflation and exchange rates using interest rates, which was made more complex by the free movement of capital. Despite declining inflation and lower pressure on the nominal exchange rate, Hungarian authorities decided to fix the currency.",0
64,21,"Higher inflation, as discussed earlier, led to a rise in foreign currency indebtedness over the years. This was particularly concerning for households that frequently acquired mortgages in Swiss francs or euros. The following chart highlights the percentage and progression of this form of debt. The primary reason for this trend was the discrepancy between interest rates in Hungary and developed countries, along with the surging inflation rate. However, this borrowing practice only caused problems if the exchange rate remained constant or increased, which was a precarious situation.",0
64,22,"The high government deficits mentioned in Figure 2 did not result in growing government debt during the period, as shown in the chart below. However, the negative trends of indebtedness in foreign currencies and growing government debt led to severe problems for the Hungarian economy in the latter half of the 2000s.",0
64,23,"The central European countries were different at the start of their transformation process, with Hungary being more accepting of the role of state company managers compared to Czechoslovakia where they were seen as high-ranking communists. As a result, Hungarian managers were able to take control of numerous companies by the late 1980s, earning the term ""spontaneous privatization.""",0
64,24,"The public's attitude towards privatization was not clear cut according to the survey. Hungary had low support for restitutions (re-privatization) and relatively high resistance to privatization overall, which was one of the highest in Eastern Europe. However, the survey showed the highest support for selling companies for the highest price offered. Laki (1993) reported that in a survey from the middle of 1991, 34% of respondents were against privatization, but as many as 55-60% were against privatization of their own company. Additionally, there was strong opposition to foreign investment and returning land to previous owners.",0
64,25,"The transformation of state companies into joint-stock companies in Hungary was made possible by the 1988 act. This significant event gave the management the power to control the companies. At the beginning of the following decade, the insiders continued to play a crucial role in the Hungarian privatization. Earle and Estrin (1996) noted that the government was unable to sell or keep full ownership of a company without the consent of insiders. Unfortunately, this important role played by the management was accompanied by scandals and embezzlement, which resulted in the public turning against the privatization process. This hindered the entire privatization process and led to a slowdown (Srholec, 2001).",0
64,26,"In 1990, the state Property Fund (SPA) was established as a vital agency for privatization in Ukraine. It controlled almost 2,000 state-owned companies, primarily in industry and agriculture. As per Earle and Estrin (1996), SPA was critical in avoiding more significant abuse of the situation because it had the authority to approve all sales. This led to the establishment of an institutional environment.",0
64,27,"In the meantime, the government initiated the small privatization process. The first undertaking, called pre-privatization, commenced in May 1990 and was focused on retail with the aim of halting impulsive privatization. Between 1991 and 1993, roughly 10,000 units were either sold or leased, predominantly being small shops and restaurants that were auctioned. A crucial aspect of this type of privatization was that the employees of the respective shops gained the majority of the property. The ensuing table outlines the changes in property ownership.",0
64,28,"Until mid-1995, SPA sold 75% of its ownership, which represented only 35% of state property. The government still owned certain industries like gas distribution, railways, airlines, telecommunication, banks, and chemical companies. However, this changed when the Bokros package was implemented. The government needed to reduce fiscal deficits urgently, and, therefore, decided to sell all the state-owned property except railways, post office, and national parks. The allocation for privatization was around HUF 1.3 trillion, out of the overall state ownership of HUF 1.6 trillion. The privatization process included direct sales to foreign investors, which resulted in a huge flow of foreign direct investment in Hungary. The government sold properties worth HUF 790 billion, and the debt decreased from 86% of GDP in 1995 to 60% in 1998.",0
64,29,"The figure demonstrates the economic growth observed in Hungary. Comparable to other central European nations, Hungary underwent a transformational recession. Its gradualist approach to reform did not prevent the downturn, leading to a discernible deceleration following 1995. Despite this, the overall trend remains positive. A comparison of results yielded by the HP filter under communist and post-1990 conditions illustrate Hungary's capacity to achieve 3 to 4 percent growth following its transformational setback.",0
64,30,"Hungary experienced an increase in unemployment during the initial stages of transformation, despite adopting a more gradual approach. The rate reached a maximum of 12% and then gradually decreased. In contrast, the Czech Republic had minimal unemployment until 1997 when it grew due to currency and economic crises. However, by this time, Hungary's unemployment rate had already been steadily decreasing. It is important to note that both countries had relatively low unemployment rates compared to other post-communist countries such as Poland. However, there was a significant drop in employment levels in Hungary that impacted the figures.",0
65,1,"The current literacy tests on economics prioritize theory and neglect the actual economy. To address this, the researchers aim to evaluate how well students are learning empirical information. Economic literacy is a worthwhile objective and the existing teaching methods aim to foster an economic mindset, but the authors do not intend to criticize the present literacy campaigns. Rather, they seek to spark a discussion within the discipline about the importance of teaching students fundamental economic facts. The study involved administering surveys to hundreds of introductory economics students, and some initial insights about their capacity to comprehend basic facts have been tabulated.",0
65,2,"Objective economics provides learners with a factual understanding of their economy, enabling them to make informed decisions and normative assumptions about its direction. Instructors must play the dual role of presenting various economic models and providing basic information on economic variables. This study emphasizes the latter role, as students' ability to make informed economic decisions is greatly enhanced by factual knowledge of real economic variables. The selection of which models to teach is not addressed in this text.",0
65,3,"There has been some debate about whether defining literacy in this way is appropriate. In 2002, Hansen, Salemi, and Siegfried published a paper proposing ways to rearrange college courses to improve literacy at that level. They argue that current introductory courses, which place a heavy emphasis on technical literacy, do not benefit the majority of students who will never receive further economics training. Hansen, Salemi, and Siegfried cite a study in which college economics course-takers scored 9 on a 15-point survey, high school economics course-takers scored an 8, and those who took no economics scored a 7 (2002, 463). In their paper, they suggest revising the introductory series to allow for more focus on real-world problems and more opportunities to practice economics. (468).",0
65,4,"It appears reasonable to suggest that those who promote the idea of ""practicing economics"" have genuine intentions of enhancing student comprehension, but what precisely does this statement entail? Does it involve instructing pupils to think in terms of utility maximization? If so, does this imply that utility maximization is not inherent and, instead, necessitates education? Does it mean just presenting our learners with the most efficient models currently available and stopping there? As mentioned at the start, introducing students to these models is critical, but failing to provide them with a fundamental grasp of genuine economic variables can have negative consequences down the line. This would be like helping students create a car but neglecting to mention that fuel is necessary for the car to run. Given the persuasive potency of basic economic analysis, it seems reasonable that we have a duty to provide our pupils with the information from which these tools are derived, as well as teaching them how to apply this knowledge effectively to whichever models we teach.",0
65,5,Colleagues are currently conducting a project that aims to investigate the American public's knowledge of economic variables. The project is predicated on the notion that informing people with factual information is more effective than using abstract economic models that lack empirical evidence. This essay is a part of this ongoing project.,0
65,6,"The selection of facts that fall under the category of ""economics"" is crucial as it sets the boundaries of the subject. Consequently, fact-based economic education has lost its significance. While some macroeconomic topics such as GDP, inflation and unemployment are universally considered important, other economists might prioritize poverty, income distribution, and interest rates. Additionally, individual interests influence the emphasis given to different topics. Nonetheless, the pertinent matter is whether we are providing our students with precise empirical statistics and dependable information about major economic issues.",0
65,7,"The aim of the working group is to assess the level of comprehension of economic variables among individuals in the economy. Since it is an ongoing project, the procedures and techniques are expected to evolve as we progress. The group undertook a survey of 341 new introductory economics students using a set of questions that emphasized significant variables. We present some initial results that we consider could be valuable to the field.",0
65,8,"The working group members acknowledge that the wording of the question on GDP may cause confusion between GDP and GDP/person. They are working to improve the survey. Nevertheless, even with the faulty question, the current data shows that people can learn and remember figures such as GDP/person, as evidenced by students who received instruction from the working group instructors and answered accurately.",0
65,9,"We conducted a survey to assess the students' level of knowledge about income distributions in the US. The survey included questions on the income required to be among the top 5% and 20% of earners in 2007, which turned out to be approximately $166,000 and $87,000 respectively. The results were presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2, indicating the percentage of students who answered within a specific income range.""",0
65,10,"The students on average believed that an income of $20,056,314 was needed to be in the top 5% and $887,906 to be in the top 20%. However, 80% overestimated the income needed for the top 5% and 70% overestimated the income needed for the top 20%. More than half of the respondents, 56% for the top 5% and 35% for the top 20%, provided an answer that was at least double the actual number. This indicates that many students have a skewed perception of income distribution in the US. These findings may explain why some politicians are able to claim that raising taxes on households earning over $250,000 would affect middle-income earners.",0
65,11,"Based on the respondents' formal training, we can analyze their responses and obtain interesting results. The data suggests that those with more formal training provide more accurate responses for the 20% level. However, for the 5% level, there seems to be no difference between individuals with ""no high school"" and ""college"" backgrounds (refer to Table 1). In fact, the study indicates that high school classes have a negative impact on understanding. It's worth noting that although the instructor's past students performed remarkably well, their average responses were still far from the actual numbers.",0
66,1,"This study examines the connection between economic freedom, foreign direct investment (FDI), and economic growth in a group of 85 countries. The study employs the generalized method-of-moment system estimator to arrive at the empirical findings which demonstrate that FDI does not have an independent (positive) influence on output growth. Rather, the impact of FDI is determined by the level of economic freedom in the receiving nations. This implies that countries that endorse greater economic activity freedom benefit considerably from the presence of multinational corporations (MNCs).",0
66,2,"The relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth has been extensively discussed in the economic literature. Policymakers have increasingly focused on attracting more FDI inflows in recent years, coinciding with the lifting of many restrictions on foreign capital flows by countries, including developing ones, since the early 1980s. As a result, global FDI inflows have significantly increased over the past few decades, with the growth rate exceeding that of both world trade and GDP. The positive effects of FDI, such as productivity gains, technological transfers, introduction of new processes and management techniques, employee training, and international production networks, have led to heightened interest in attracting FDI. Furthermore, FDI is considered less volatile than other forms of capital and thus less destructive.",0
66,3,"This research paper looks to deepen the understanding of the connection between foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth by taking into account the role of institutions. Recent literature has brought attention to the importance of economic freedom in facilitating FDI spillovers, which refers to how multinational corporations transfer knowledge and technology to host countries. The lack of economic freedom can hinder a nation's ability to assimilate this new knowledge and technology, which can subsequently impede economic growth. Although previous studies have also highlighted the importance of economic freedom, they have mainly focused on its direct impact on economic growth. Therefore, this article contributes to the existing literature by examining the role of economic freedom in creating wealth.",0
66,4,"In this paper, we examine the potential correlation between economic freedom and growth by utilizing the index of economic freedom (EF) provided by the Fraser Institute. This index is a measure of institutional quality that grants insight into the factors of an atmosphere conducive to prosperity. Looking at the index components, we expect that countries with higher levels of EF will have superior absorptive capacity, allowing them to reap the benefits of FDI spillovers. Less regulation is generally agreed upon by the profession as good for economic advancement. A free and competitive market presents more opportunities for entrepreneurs to pursue new ideas and incentivizes firms to take on risky ventures such as FDI-related activities for high investment returns. Conversely, a heavily regulated market will not function efficiently, leading to inadequate allocation of resources. If financial markets are extensively regulated, activities related to FDI will be impacted as firms need external funding to finance the adoption of new technology. (Alfaro et al., 2004)",0
66,5,"The reason behind providing tax incentives and subsidies, as well as adopting policies that encourage Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), is due to the belief that FDI will bring significant benefits to the receiving countries. Multinational Corporations (MNCs) are associated with advanced technologies, patents, trade secrets, brand names, management techniques, and marketing strategies, as well as being renowned for their significant R&D expenditure. Additionally, they hire a considerable number of technical and professional employees. FDIs provide instant access to innovative technology that can benefit not only those receiving the foreign capital but also other businesses in the host country, similar to domestic investments. FDIs may also assist in rectifying the balance-of-payment deficits, increase job opportunities, and provide crucial training for managers and workers. Furthermore, export-oriented FDIs might promote exports by establishing assembling plants and supporting local businesses in accessing foreign markets for exports.",0
66,6,"The necessity of skilled labour to handle new technologies has been debated, and Borensztein et al. discovered that FDI inflows had a minor effect on growth. However, in countries where the human capital surpassed a certain threshold, it positively contributed to growth when interacted with FDI. In contrast, the same interaction effect was not significant for domestic investment, which could reflect the technological distinctions between FDI and domestic investment. This proposes that developed countries, with higher human capital, are more likely to benefit from FDIs. Xu's study supported this standpoint, finding that technology transfer by MNCs from the U.S. contributed to productivity growth in developed countries but not developing countries. However, Alfaro et al. disagreed with this notion, stating that human capital did not mediate FDI inflows. Instead, they suggested that the financial sector's development was more important than human capital for FDI spillovers.",0
66,7,"Although the evidence regarding the relationship between FDI and growth is inconclusive, the evidence supporting the role of institutions in the development process is more persuasive. According to North (1990), who is well-known as an economic institutionalist, institutions are the limitations or guidelines created by humans that establish political, economic, and social interactions. Essential components of these institutions include formal rules such as constitutions, property rights maintained through the legal system and law enforcement, as well as informal constraints (e.g. tradition, cultural norms, behaviors, and customs). The structure of these institutions, he notes, establishes the motivation for an economy. As the structure develops, it directs economic evolution towards growth. In essence, institutions affect the investment security, corruption rates, skewed or extractive policies, and ultimately, are influential on the urge to invest in the human and physical capital, which contributes to economic growth.",0
66,8,"Institutions play a vital role in economic development, as affirmed by several recent studies. Knack and Keefer introduced the use of property right security indicators as proxies for institutional quality in growth literature, with indices such as ICRG and BERI. These markers include the quality of bureaucracy, property rights, and political stability. Cross-country analyses reveal a strong, positive correlation between these factors and economic performance. Barro adds that secure property rights encourage investments and increase investment productivity, thereby enhancing growth. Furthermore, Demetriades and Law suggest that strong institutions have more impact on output per capita in low-income nations compared to financial developments. Rodrik et al. show that the quality of institutions is more important than geography and integration for explaining cross-country income differentials. Finally, Acemoglu et al. measure the efficacy of current institutions using the ICRG's protection from expropriation risk index.",0
66,9,"empirical research on the relationship between FDI and growth is limited, particularly in terms of the impact of economic freedom on FDI spillovers. It is suggested that countries with more economic freedom benefit more from the presence of MNCs, but there is no concrete evidence to support this claim. Further empirical evidence is needed to advance the literature on FDI and growth.",0
66,10,"The use of GMM estimators can be in one- and two-step variants, with the latter being more efficient in large samples but problematic in small ones due to instrument proliferation. Windmeijer's simulation analysis shows that the two-step GMM estimator with numerous instruments can result in biased standard errors and parameter estimates, while Bowsher notes that numerous instruments may weaken the overidentification test. To address these issues, Roodman suggests reducing the dimensionality of the instrumental variable matrix.",0
66,11,"The empirical findings using three different approaches discussed in Section 5 are presented in this section. Tables 1-5 report the empirical results. Table 1 reports a preliminary analysis on the effects of FDI and EF on growth. Table 2 presents coefficient estimates obtained from the baseline specification, which used an interaction term constructed as a product of FDI and EF index. Table 3 reports the coefficients estimate from a specification that uses dummies to capture the contingency impact of FDI on growth at different levels of EF. Table 4 displays the estimated coefficient obtained using sample splitting under which linear growth-FDI relationships are estimated using two different subsamples. Finally, the results on the interaction specification using the components of EF index are displayed in Table 5. The objective is to indicate whether the component of the EF index yields qualitatively similar results to that of the aggregate index.",0
66,12,"""Several studies have explored the relationship between FDI and economic growth, but their findings are inconsistent. In newer research, it seems that the recipient nations' absorptive ability is the primary factor contributing to this uncertainty. This study aims to investigate a new component of absorptive capacity, EF, which looks at whether the degree of economic activity freedom in host nations influences the marginal impact of FDI on growth.""",0
66,13,"Using panel data from 85 countries over the period 1975-2004, our empirical analysis draws three important conclusions. Firstly, FDI alone has no direct impact on output growth, which supports previous studies. Secondly, EF is identified as an important driver for countries' long-term growth, and this finding is consistent with prior research. Finally, the impact of FDI on growth is determined by the level of EF in the country. Our study shows that countries promoting economic freedom benefit significantly from MNCs' presence as firms can more easily absorb and adopt new technology and other benefits associated with FDI inflows. This finding suggests that EF is a crucial element of a nation's absorptive capacity, which has been somewhat neglected in earlier research.",0
66,14,"Cross-border exchange of goods and services can benefit domestic companies and their ability to sell products in international markets. Exporting involves expenses such as building distribution networks, transportation systems, and an understanding of overseas consumer preferences, which multinational corporations (MNCs) are often better equipped to handle. Domestic companies can reduce their costs by emulating or collaborating with foreign firms that are already exporting. These benefits can lead to greater operational efficiency for domestic companies. International trade also provides domestic companies with access to more diverse intermediate goods and capital equipment, which can increase productivity.",0
66,15,"Reducing regulatory constraints such as labor, business, and credit is crucial for encouraging spillovers in FDI. For instance, relaxed regulations on the hiring and firing of workers in the host country can lead to increased labor mobility, with workers from MNCs transferring their knowledge and technological expertise to domestic firms. The level of regulatory restrictions on business operations can also impact FDI spillovers by affecting market competition. If the industry is highly competitive due to fewer regulations, MNCs may be more willing to share their technology with domestic suppliers in order to secure intermediate goods at competitive prices. Access to external funds is also crucial for technology upgrading, and reducing regulatory constraints can enhance the success of domestic firms in acquiring new technology. This was documented by Alfaro et al. (2004).",0
66,16,"Policymakers need to balance the cost-effectiveness of policies aimed at attracting FDI versus those focused on improving EF. It is advisable to prioritize policies that enhance economic freedom since they are likely to produce greater benefits in the long run. Countries that fail to adopt these strategies will fall behind in the global competition. Policymakers should establish easy-to-understand policies for potential investors before turning to other incentives to attract investment. Nonetheless, implementing these reforms can be a daunting task that requires a strong commitment in the long term. While political resistance may arise in certain countries in the short term, the eventual economic benefits could be considerable.",0
66,17,"Despite the significant findings, it is important to note some limitations. Our main specification's interaction term forces FDI's impact on growth to increase or decrease monotonically with the level of EF. However, it is possible that a certain level of EF is necessary before FDI can affect host countries. Only countries with high absorptive capacity are likely to benefit from foreign capital, while countries with low absorptive capacity experience less or no benefits from FDI. This implies the need for a more adaptable specification that can account for different types of interactions between FDI, output growth, and economic freedom. A possible solution is to use a regression model based on threshold effects to capture the presence of contingency effects. We will further explore this in future research.",0
