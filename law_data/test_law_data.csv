76,20,"The response in the foreign trade sector was much greater than even the optimists anticipated. As already seen, export earnings rose dramatically, and India was much more integrated into the world economy, although its share of world exports was still low (at 1%) contrasted with its share in the early 1950s. Although there is some indication that export growth may have slowed in the last half of 2007 and early 2008, merchandise export growth averaged over 20% annually from 2003每2004 to 2005每2006, the last year for which data are available. In addition, service exports grew exceptionally rapidly, more than doubling in each of the three most recent years. Indeed, in 2005/06, India had a positive services balance equal to 3% of GDP.",1
76,21,"Some observers have questioned whether the success of Indian IT services was the result of government intervention and government policies. In fact, however, the opposite seems to be the case: the IT sector started its rapid growth period without significant government encouragement. Indeed, a major factor seems to have been that it is a service industry that was not subject to significant government regulation during its early period. Hence, it was able to become established with much less government intervention than was the case with many other industries. In addition, the IT industry was much less dependent on Indian infrastructure than were most other manufactures. Satellite communications were a major vehicle for transmission of product between foreign buyers and Indian providers. The success of the Indian IT sector exceeded all expectations of what India could achieve, and has resulted in a considerable increase in optimism about India＊s economic capabilities. This last may be the most important contribution of the IT sector to India＊s economic policy and growth prospects.",1
76,22,"It was already stated that momentum for reform has dwindled sharply in the past 3 or so years. For the future, the key questions are whether the reform momentum has largely stalled for the foreseeable future and, if so, what are the growth prospects and what reforms are needed in the short to medium run to maintain or accelerate growth.",1
77,1,"The evolution and outcomes of conflicts in Europe, including the current one in Ukraine, have been influenced by the dynamics of economic, technological and military balances, which in turn are affected by the economic warfare and sanctions that have been used to alter them. This article reviews defence economic concepts of relevance to the Ukraine conflict and then draws out lessons for the present concerning power balances, military capabilities, conventional deterrence, economic warfare and counter-measures against sanctions from experiences in Europe in the twentieth century. An evaluation is made of the impacts of economic sanctions on Russia and Ukraine in 2014每2016.",1
77,2,"The analysis is divided into two inter-related components, both covering the period 19172016. The first is concerned with the assessment of: the organisation and performance of the defence sectors in the economies of the USSR and Russia; trends in defence capabilities, economic and military balances, and conventional deterrence in Europe; the adequacy of resources allocated to support NATO, including its expansion in the 2000s; and comparison of the economic power and military capabilities of Russia and Ukraine in 2013每2016. The second section evaluates the causes and features of Western economic warfare directed at the USSR/Russia, as well as Russian responses and economic results in the periods 1917每1945, 1945每1991 and 1992每2013. it then describes Western economic sanctions imposed on Russia in connection with the Ukraine conflict and assesses their economic, military and political impacts. The remainder of this introduction reviews concepts related to these main sections.",1
77,3,"The concept of economic power of relevance to national security concerns what Knorr (1957, p. 8) called ＆economic defense potential＊, which is determined by the volume and rate of growth of GDP, the structure and flexibility of output at the sector level, and capabilities in science and technology. Economic power is produced by an economic system that is governed by economic policies and functions in a multi-dimensional economic environment (Gregory & Stuart, 1999). OECD/NATO countries have had competitive and open market economies, which over time have performed well at macro and micro levels in the generation of economic power. in contrast, the USSR/CMEA countries had centralised, state-owned, planned and closed economies. These developed the characteristics of a ＆shortage economy＊, which generated rapid extensive economic growth but inhibited efficiency and technological progress (Davis & Charemza, 1989; Kornai, 1980, 1992). Following the collapse of the communist/ command systems in Europe, all countries engaged in the processes of economic transition. Those in East Europe and the Baltic region made rapid progress to market economies and joined the EU. But Russia, Ukraine and other states that emerged from the USSR developed hybrid economic systems (part market, part state) that performed poorly in the 1990s.",1
77,4,"Similar points were made by Lenin and early Soviet defence economists (Davis, 1991a). During World War ii all major countries not only studied the problem of how to convert economic power into military capabilities, but also implemented policies in their war economies to accomplish this, with varying degrees of success. in the post-war period Knorr (1957, p. 7, 1973) argued that ＆defense potential＊was dependent not only on economic power, but also on the efficiency of the utilisation of resources devoted to defence (organisational ability) and on the＆will to provide for military power＊(e.g. share of GDP devoted to defence). Studies of economic power and security have been continued up to the present (Fels, Kremer, & Kronenberg, 2012).",1
77,5,"in the case of the USSR, the defence sector was given a high priority status within the planned economy, which meant that it benefited from the preferential allocation of scarce resources and from the establishment of special organisations (e.g. the Military每industrial Commission) to ensure the accomplishment of the national security objectives of the state. Aspects of Soviet defence organisation have been maintained in the Russian Federation (Davis, 2002).",1
77,6,"Government policy makers take into account external and domestic threats (military, economic, political) when developing a national security strategy that includes both threat reduction programmes (diplomatic, propaganda, arms control, espionage) and the military capabilities generated by the defence sector (Davis, 1986a, 1986b, 1992). i n the case of the USSR, the strategy of the Brezhnev regime placed heavy emphasis on military power, whereas the Gorbachev government shifted it to threat reduction (see quotation on p. 6). in the Russian Federation, the government of Yeltsin placed less emphasis on military power than has that of Putin.",1
77,7,"Economic warfare (including specific economic sanctions) is intended primarily to influence economic, technology and military power balances to the advantage of the country/alliance conducting it. Punitive measures can relate to trade in commodities (embargo, denial of ＆Most-Favoured Nation＊ (MFN) status, refusal of export licences, preclusive buying) and finance (freezing of assets, restrictions on lending, expropriation of property) (Baldwin, 1985, p. 41). Even in periods with no overt economic warfare, countries that are leaders in technology maintain controls on exports that concern both the features of technologies (e.g. advanced encryption) and potential recipient countries (Joyner, 2006; Kabrt & Jung, 2015; MacDaniel, 1993; Rode & Jacobsen, 1985).",1
77,8,"in this article economic warfare (including sanctions) is interpreted as a politico-economic process with a beginning, an end, and the following features in between: EWF (Economic Warfare Feature) 1, trigger (cause); EWF 2, establishment of objectives (economic, military, political); EWF 3, agreement on conditions for termination; EWF 4, decisions on specific measures (e.g. restrictions on trade and finance); EWF 5, comprehensiveness of participation; EWF 6, commitment to implementation (e.g. rigorous or symbolic); EWF 7, effectiveness of counter-measures; EWF 8, evaluation of impacts; and EWF 9, removal of restrictions/sanctions. These nine features are discussed throughout the historical periods examined in the second section of this article, including the one related to the Ukraine conflict. Elements of this process (trigger, measures, counter-measures, economic impacts) are summarised in three historical tables covering Western economic warfare (sanctions) directed against the USSR/Russia during 1917每1945 (Table 6), 1949每1991 (Table 7) and 1992每2016 (Table 8). A more detailed assessment of anti-Russia sanctions related to the Ukraine conflict is presented in Table 10, which considers specific measures, goals and impacts (economic, military, political) during 2014每2016.",1
77,9,"The Soviet Union emerged victorious from World War ii, but its economy was severely damaged and its structure was distorted in favour of the military sector. By the mid-1950s it had reduced the military burden and entered a period of rapid extensive growth with rising living standards that continued into the mid-1970s (Davis, 1999, 2014a). The index of USSR industrial production (1970=100.0) increased from 22.2 in 1950 to a peak of 189.1 in 1988 (Figure 1). Despite Western economic warfare, the Soviet Union became the dominant economic power in Europe. Although the USSR introduced numerous economic reforms, it retained an inefficient shortage economy that was characterised by decelerating GDP growth and sluggish technological innovation (Ellman & Kontorovich, 1992; Gregory & Stuart, 2001).",1
77,10,"Soviet hard-currency trade through its state monopoly expanded dramatically in the 1970s because of increases in world market prices for energy and in exports of oil and gas: energy earnings rose from $388 million in 1970 to $18,865 million in 1984. The government made use of its evolving＆Rent Management System＊(RMS) (HP 4) to redistribute the growing energy ＆rent＊ (value) to finance imports, to support the defence effort, and to subsidise inefficient enterprises (HP 3) and East European countries (HP 5) (Davis, 2014a; Gaddy & ickes, 2005; Marrese & vanous, 1983).",1
77,11,"OECD economies grew at healthy rates during 1950每1973, experienced ＆stagflation＊ in 1974每1980 due to oil price shocks, and then entered a period of sustained growth. Overall, from 1965 to 1985 Soviet economic power declined relative to the major OECD countries and the technology gap with the USA widened: 8每10 years for advanced microcircuits and 9每15 years for mainframe computers in the mid-1980s (DOD (US Department of Defense), 1988).",1
77,12,"From the mid-1960s the Soviet leadership pursued an ambitious strategy to enhance national security that placed greater emphasis on military power than on threat reduction (Davis, 1992, 2002; Sapir, 1991). The allocation of resources to the defence sector rose substantially and by the 1980s the defence burden was around 15% of GDP. The increases in the armed forces and deployed weapons are shown in Table 1. Western economic warfare (discussed in the next main section) slowed the emergence of the USSR as the second superpower, but did not prevent it (DOD, 1981 ... 1990).",1
77,13,"Russia and Ukraine emerged as independent states in 1991 with similar inheritances of a malfunctioning shortage economy with newly revealed negative value-added components (HP 3) and the common challenge of establishing a market system in difficult politico-economic circumstances. Due to the weakness of the state in Russia there was a break-down in the priority protection system and in central control of the RMS (HP 4), which had less rent (value) to distribute because of low energy prices ($22 per barrel). initial macroeconomic stabilisation efforts failed in both countries, which resulted in 40% declines in GDP and high inflation (EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development), 1994 ... 1999). Microeconomic processes were dominated by barter between firms, build-ups of informal inter-enterprise debt, pervasive second economy activity and corruption (HP 2), ineffective privatisation, limited industrial restructuring, and little FDi (see Note 10). ",1
77,14,"vladimir Putin was elected President of Russia in 2000 and has remained the dominant leader since then. Despite slow progress with economic reforms in Russia, GDP grew by an average of 7% during 2000每2008 due to increases in earnings from energy exports (the oil price rose to a peak of $145 per barrel in 2008) and in consumption and investment. The greater resource rents available to the government through the RMS (HP 4) enabled it to support welfare programmes, subsidise negative-value added and loss-making industries (HP 3), and reduce domestic and international debt (Connolly, 2015a; Gaddy & ickes, 2010). However, the RMS continued to allow substantial informal siphoning off of rents and the second economy (HP 2), with its related corruption networks, remained an important component of the Russian economy (Kim & Kang, 2009). The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) caused temporary negative growth, but the population and economy in Russia were protected by stabilisation funds built up prudently by imposing high taxes on energy exports. During 2010每2013 GDP growth was a healthy 3.4%, inflation remained low, and surpluses were achieved in the state budget and current account (see Table 3 for 2012每2013). Russia＊s high growth rates enabled it to reduce the economic power gap in Europe.",1
77,15,"With respect to macroeconomic performance, growth of GDP in Ukraine recovered to an average of 7% over 2000每2008, but then contracted by 15% in 2009. During 2010每2013 Ukraine had a low average growth rate of 2.4% (zero in 2013), chronic budget and current account deficits, and high foreign debt to GDP burdens (79% in 2013) (Table 3). Ukraine remained dependent on Russia for energy supplies and as a market for exports of uncompetitive industrial commodities (HP 5) (Gaddy & ickes, 2014a).",1
77,16,"The first question concerns the commitments of resources made by both the USSR and NATO countries to achieve their security objectives and establish a military balance in Europe. Due to the traumatic experiences of World War ii, NATO countries and the USSR were committed to converting economic power into military capabilities and to maintaining combat readiness. These policies resulted in the USSR devoting around 15% of GDP to defence in the mid-1980s and in the leading NATO countries accepting relatively heavy defence burdens for democracies in peacetime: USA 6%, UK 5%, France 4% and Germany 3%. Although these military efforts strained economies (especially that of the USSR) and entailed significant opportunity costs, they contributed to peace in Europe, stability of borders, and nuclear and conventional deterrence.",1
77,17,"The USSR economy was significantly smaller than those of its NATO adversaries and its technological level was lower. However, the Soviet Union developed a unique, insulated military economic system (central planning and rationing, high priority, technological espionage) that enabled it to mobilise its limited resources to become the dominant European industrial and military power (Figure 1, Table 2). However, the exceptionally heavy defence burden and well-known flaws in the general economic and political systems contributed to the collapse of the USSR. Most institutional features of the Soviet defence sector were carried over to the Russian Federation (Figure 2). However, in the 1990s the priority of the military每industrial complex declined and the armed forces, defence industry and military R&D experienced severe economic difficulties. The situation changed for the better in the 2000s as a result of economic recovery and the raised priority of national security programmes. As in the past, the top leadership is closely involved in managing the military每industrial complex (e.g. President Putin is head of both the Security Council and the State Commission for Military每Industrial Issues). The conflicts during 2013每2016 in Ukraine and Syria demonstrate that the Russian economy can generate necessary military capabilities and that the leadership has the will to employ them.",1
77,18,"Over the past century the dynamics of economic, technological and military balances have helped to explain the rise and fall of nations and alliances. This was evident in the case of World War ii. in the Cold War period the NATO countries had greater economic power and a higher average technological level than the USSR, but for several decades the latter was able to achieve military balance through its defence economic arrangements. in the post-communist period the NATO countries have maintained their economic power and technological superiority. However, as a result of continued NATO cuts in defence spending and the increased Russian defence effort the balance of deployed conventional military capabilities in Europe shifted in favour of Russia. Table 5 demonstrates that by 2013 Russia had overwhelming advantages over Ukraine in the local balance of economic and military power. These military imbalances contributed to Russia＊s annexation of Crimea and support for insurgents in eastern Ukraine.",1
77,19,"The USA, Japan and European countries conducted economic warfare (supplemented by sanctions) against the USSR throughout 1917每1991 (Tables 6 and 7). However, there were recurrent disagreements between participants with respect to perceptions of triggers, objectives, termination conditions, and specific measures that limited the comprehensiveness of and commitments to economic warfare. The wide-ranging trade controls of CoCom achieved some successes. But the robust counter-measure Spetsinformatsiya system enabled the USSR to obtain controlled goods and secrets through trade diversion and technological espionage. Table 8 indicates that in the period 1992每2013 lower key and fragmented efforts were made by the West to control the flows of technology to Russia and to impose economic sanctions. These achieved some goals concerning specific products or sectors. Overall, the answer to question five is that Western economic warfare and sanctions directed at the USSR/Russia over the period 1917每2013 did not achieve intended ambitious objectives concerning the alteration of economic and military power balances, but did slow the development of the USSR into a superpower.",1
78,1,"Introducing a roundtable discussion of the World Bank＊s World Development Report 2009: Reshaping Economic Geography, this article contextualizes the report in intellectual and political terms. It reflects on the lost opportunities for, and potential limits of, engagement between the style of New Economic Geography espoused by the World Bank and the pluralist heterodoxy of economic geography ※proper,§ before briefly previewing the commentaries from Gillian Hart, Victoria Lawson, and Andr谷s Rodr赤guez-Pose and the response from World Bank authors Uwe Deichmann, Indermit Gill, and Chor Ching Goh.ecge_1093",1
78,2,"This collection of commentaries represents an attempt to revisit some of the concerns that motivated the Boston roundtable, now that the full report has been circulated extensively and the wave of initial reactions has passed. Discounting the subdisciplinary pique that has (quite understandably, perhaps) accompanied the responses of many economic geographers, what should be made of the substantive arguments〞concerning, for example, the relationship between urbanization and long-run economic development〞contained in the report? Are the WDR 2009＊s methods, and its policy messages, ultimately irreconcilable with the kinds of economic geography practiced by the (small but heterodox) field that has long self-identified with this moniker? Are conversations between (geographical) economists and (economic) geographers destined to remain dialogues of the deaf? Might there, nevertheless, be lessons for both ※sides?§",1
78,3,"If, as it has been said, the World Bank ※is to economic development theology what the papacy is to Catholicism, complete with yearly encyclicals§ (Holland 1998, 4), then the arrival of any WDR is a momentous event. By definition, the WDRs engage with, and in many ways anoint, issues of global significance. Recent iterations have, for example, dealt with issues such as the role of the state, gender inequalities, climate change, poverty, transition economies, and environmental sustainability. And even if their diagnoses and policy messages cannot simplistically be assumed to represent a condensate of ※World Bank thinking,§ not least since the agency is hardly monolithic, the WDRs can be seen as strategically significant indications of this sprawling institution＊s evolving worldview〞and, in some instances, as statements of policymaking intent (see Wade 2001; Maringanti, Sheppard, and Zhang 2009). The positioning of ※economic geography§ in this exalted realm therefore calls attention, in a quite unprecedented way, to the spatialities of economic development, notwithstanding the ambivalent implications for the academic field formerly known as economic geography.",1
78,4,"In intellectual terms, the principal points of reference for the WDR 2009 derive from the New Economic Geography (NEG), a project that, with few exceptions, has had a rather troubled history with economic geography-proper (cf. Martin 1999), an attitude of indifference on one side being asymmetrically met by a mix of suspicion and antagonism on the other side. In substantive terms, the WDR 2009＊s concern with urbanization as a global phenomenon marks the world-historical threshold, passed some time in the last decade, when the majority of the planet＊s population was counted as formally ※urban§ (United Nations 2008); the social stresses and development challenges facing cities seem certain to multiply over the coming decades. Framed in these contexts, the WDR 2009 makes a bold case for the long-run efficiencies of trade-driven concentration-cumspecialization 角 la Krugman, embracing not only urbanization but also, more controversially, uneven spatial development as necessary facets of economic growth and poverty alleviation. Richly illustrated, with the benefit of the latest geocoded data and considerable cartographic ingenuity, the vocabulary of the WDR 2009 is essentially that of neoclassical economic geography (a.k.a. geographical economics or the NEG), while its confident voice resonates with the authority of cosmopolitan policy management.",1
78,5,"The catholicism of economic geography and development studies/geography, in contrast, is most certainly of the atheistic, small ※c§ variety. These two fields, which have evolved along parallel tracks for reasons that today seem indefensible, both tend to exhibit a rather unruly ethos of almost-unbounded heterodoxy〞skeptical of paradigmatic claims emanating from just about any source, from Marxism to neoclassical economics. What passes as the center here has no more than a weak gravitational pull, around a fluid zone of engagement between, inter alia, institutional political economy, postcolonial theory, economic sociology and economic anthropology, (post)Marxism, socioeconomics, political ecology, feminism, and evolutionary and institutional economics. Here, economies and economic development are typically understood in expansive and integral terms, as socially and spatially constituted phenomena, and as sites of (often-contradictory) economic processes that are never found〞and never travel〞alone, but which exist only in institutionally regulated and culturally embedded forms.",1
78,6,"The nature of economic geography＊s rather mutable heterodoxy has been rather difficult to characterize, even from the ※inside§ (see Clark 1998; Scott 2000; Peck 2000, 2005; Sheppard 2006; Lawson 2010). From the ※outside,§ Paul Krugman once expressed his indifference to (if not incomprehension of) economic geography-proper, as a field apparently preoccupied with ※post-Fordism [and] the Derrida-influenced regulation school,§ heaping faint praise on earlier traditions of work in geography for their ※empirical insights, good stories and obvious practical importance,§ but giving up on the new wave of ※deconstructionist geography§ (Krugman 1995, 41, 85; cf. Barnes 2003). If, indeed, there is anything that unifies the pluralist endeavor of economic geography today, it may be a rather antagonistic relationship with orthodox economics, although there are notable exceptions even to this general rule (see Clark, Feldman, and Gertler 2000; Wrigley and Overman 2010; Rodr赤guez-Pose 2010). The WDR 2009＊s near-uniformly critical reception in economic geography and development studies must be understood, therefore, as less singularly negative (cf. Buckley and Buckley 2009) than ※plurally negative.§",1
78,7,"This can be seen as a strategy, quite literally, of making the most of uneven development, on the grounds that in the longer-term economic benefits will ※trickle out§ from favored centers of growth to the progressively integrating periphery. As Allen Scott (2009) argues in his trenchant critique of the WDR 2009, uneven spatial development may indeed be inevitable, but that does not negate the case for active policy measures〞not least because the political fallout in abandoned regions might destabilize the development process itself, never mind the social costs. His own work on agglomeration economies has convinced him, moreover, that regional institution building also has a vital role to play in shaping the character of development in growth regions. (The same might be said, moreover, about uneven spatial development, the intensity and form of which also vary with policy regimes.) Yet such considerations tend to fall outside the purview of the WDR 2009, due to what Scott portrays as its ※blinkered vision.§",1
78,8,"While Harvey notes the curious neglect of classical theorists of agglomeration, like August L?sch, Johann Heinrich von Th邦nen, Alfred Weber, and Edgar Hoovermarginalized during the long aspatial turn of twentieth-century economics, prior to their recuperation under the NEG〞Scott is equally perplexed about what he sees as an unnecessarily narrow-gauge reading of economics itself. (The WDR 2009, he notes, is largely silent on the economics of path dependency, cumulative causation, and on evolutionary and institutional economics and comparative political economy, not to mention regulation theory.) It would be quite wrong to characterize these responses as mere defenses of disciplinary turf or claims on academic naming rights. Economic geography effectively abandoned many of the questions reformulated under the NEG long ago, and its reengagement with agglomeration economics since the 1980s has been much more attentive to institutions and culture. New Intellectual allies, meanwhile, have been found across the broad terrain of heterodox economic studies.",1
78,9,"It is not just that economists and geographers appear to speak different languages. More fundamentally, at an ontological level, a Rostovian developmental teleology, together with the notion of long-term competitive convergence through the application of a pan-regional development fix, are difficult (if not impossible) to reconcile with some of the central axioms of contemporary geographical scholarship〞namely, that economic development, national growth, and urban trajectories are spatially differentiated in qualitative form, not just contingent expression (see Peck and Theodore 2007; Bryceson, Gough, Rigg, and Agergaard 2009; Maringanti, Sheppard, and Zhang 2009; Hart 2010). The pluralization of economies in (economic and development) geography, then, is not just a poststructuralist tic; it speaks to an appreciation of geographically differentiated economic processes, of sociospatial embeddedness, and of both the reality and the still-to-be-realized potential of alternative economic pathways. Essentially unitary development visions〞even their triptych reformulations in the WDR 2009 that acknowledges certain registers of spatial difference only to fold these back into a unidirectional development trajectory〞cannot be reconciled with such plural views.",1
78,10,"Ultimately, it is this apparent irreconcilability of prevailing intellectual (and perhaps normative) worldviews that appears to be the principal reason for the exasperated tone that has characterized the WDR 2009＊s reception in economic geography and development studies, where the majority of published reviews are concentrated. Economists, on the other hand, have reviewed the report more favorably, although not yet in any of their discipline＊s mainline journals (Montgomery 2009; Buckley and Buckley 2009). Buckley and Buckley＊s (2009, 2806) attempt to engage seriously with geographers＊ critiques concedes some meaningful differences of emphasis and orientation, but rather baldly counters that ※some of their criticisms are not valid.§ There is perhaps a sense here that geographers, professionally inclined to sustain the contention that ※things are different here,§ need somehow to fall in line〞along with skeptical governments〞with what are often presented as encircling and superior forms of economic logic. ※Growth, says the bank, is inevitably lumpy,§ is how The Economist (※Lump Together and Like It§ 2009, 65) tartly summarized the WDR 2009. ※Governments must learn to like it.§",1
78,11,"In rather a different way, Gillian Hart (2010, 342) also seeks to tackle the WDR 2009 ※on [its] own turf,§ emphasizing its neglect of finance markets. She takes issue, too, with the adoption of a ※linear§ (Rostovian) model of economic development. Noting, like Harvey (2009), how the unanticipated, massive failure of global finance markets in 2008 was bound up with a radical remapping of the global economy (and international economic relationships), she goes on to rehearse the geopolitics of global finance in the post-Bretton Woods era. This geopolitical environment, she argues, has functioned to sustain the dominance of the U.S. dollar, while dividing developing nations between the debt-dependent (of Latin America and Africa, subject to neoliberal structural adjustment and lost decades of development) and those (Asian) countries that avoided the debt trap by running trade surpluses based on manufactured exports. Comparing China with South Africa, she argues that China＊s state-led policies, including township and village enterprises, have underwritten higher real wages than have policies in South Africa, where apartheid was followed by structural adjustment. Whereas China has accumulated massive surpluses, providing insulation from global financial crises, South African firms and elites have moved their financial portfolios offshore into global financial centers. ",1
78,12,"Responding to what they characterize as three constructive critiques, Uwe Deichmann, Indermit Gill, and Chor Ching Goh (2010) of the World Bank reiterate what they see as the merits of the WDR 2009. Like Buckley and Buckley (2009), they argue that this is not simply a laissez-faire (or neoliberal) analysis, given its focus on policymaking. Retracing the policy road map of the WDR 2009, they document its positive reception among policymakers, summarizing the planned diffusion strategy〞which, through a series of studies at the continental, national, and provincial scale, aspires to fine-tune the ※reshaping economic geography§ framework to a range of regional contexts. Geographers have been involved, they argue, from the ※earliest stages§ through to these regional case studies. The World Bank team responds briefly to the three commentaries. They dismiss Hart＊s call for attention to finance on the grounds that finance markets have not malfunctioned in ways that have ※impeded geographic transformations§ (2010, 374). ",1
78,13,"What is to be made of this faltering conversation? Elsewhere, Barnes and Sheppard (2010) have issued a plea for a renewed commitment to ※engaged pluralism§ between geographers and economists, as well as across the community of economic geographers, calling for constructively critical engagements in which everything is potentially up for grabs, with all parties prepared to reexamine their most cherished, hard-core beliefs. The essays that follow indicate that such engagement may remain, for the time being, as difficult to realize as it is important〞particularly given what Rodr赤guez-Pose calls the ※Realpolitik power structures§ (2010, 368) that empower economists＊ interventions in comparison to those of geographers. We note, for example, conspicuous silences in the World Bank team＊s response here: the persistent criticism of Rostovian developmental imaginaries goes unanswered, and their dismissal of the role of financial markets flies in the face of Hart＊s summary of research purporting to demonstrate the opposite. There may be three speeds, but there is still only one direction; there may be three world-developmental zones, but each anticipates a higher stage of market integration.",1
76,20,"The response from the foreign trade sector exceeded even the expectations of optimists. Export earnings rose significantly and India became more integrated into the global economy, although its share of world exports remained low at 1%, compared to the early 1950s. While there are indications that export growth may have slowed in the latter part of 2007 and early 2008, merchandise export growth averaged over 20% annually from 2003-2004 to 2005-2006, which is the last year for which data is available. Additionally, service exports grew exceptionally quickly, more than doubling in each of the past three years. In 2005/06, India had a positive services balance proportional to 3% of its GDP.",0
76,21,"Some have questioned if the Indian IT services' achievement is due to government intervention and policies. However, it seems that the opposite is true. The IT industry grew rapidly without government support, mostly due to being a service industry that faced fewer government regulations at its inception. Furthermore, the IT sector relied less on Indian infrastructure than other industries, using satellite communications for product transmission between foreign buyers and Indian providers. The success of the Indian IT sector exceeded expectations and has increased economic optimism in India. Ultimately, the IT industry's crucial contribution to India's economic policies is the increase in confidence about India's economic capabilities.",0
76,22,"The momentum for reform has significantly decreased over the last three years. The crucial queries for the future are if this momentum will continue to stagnate, what are the growth possibilities, and what short to medium-term reforms are necessary to uphold or quicken the growth.",0
77,1,"The way conflicts in Europe, such as the ongoing one in Ukraine, have played out has been shaped by economic, technological, and military factors, which in turn have been impacted by economic warfare and sanctions. This article examines the relevant defence economic concepts related to the Ukraine conflict and draws on historical experiences in 20th century Europe to provide lessons on power balances, military capabilities, conventional deterrence, economic warfare, and countermeasures against sanctions. Additionally, the effects of economic sanctions on Russia and Ukraine between 2014 and 2016 are evaluated.",0
77,2,"The analysis comprises two interconnected parts that cover the years 1917-2016. The first one assesses the performance and organization of the defence sectors in Russia and the USSR, along with trends in defence capabilities, economic and military balances, and conventional deterrence in Europe. It also evaluates the resources supporting NATO and compares the military prowess and economic power of Russia and Ukraine between 2013 and 2016. The second part focuses on the reasons and characteristics of Western economic warfare against Russia and its responses to the same in 1917-1945, 1945-1991, and 1992-2013. Additionally, it discusses the impact of Western sanctions connected to the Ukraine conflict on Russia's economy, military, and politics. The introduction provides an overview of terms and ideas related to these two main sections.",0
77,3,"The economic power relevant to national security is determined by the GDP's volume and growth rate, sector level output's structure and flexibility, and capabilities in science and technology. Economic system governance through policies and functions within a multi-dimensional economic environment shapes economic power, with OECD/NATO countries having open market economies that generate macro and micro-level economic power. In contrast, the USSR/CMEA countries had centralised, state-owned, planned and closed economies that generated extensive economic growth but inhibited efficiency and technological progress. The collapse of command systems in Europe initiated economic transition processes. Countries in East Europe and the Baltic region made swift progress towards market economies and joined the EU. However, Russia, Ukraine and other former USSR states developed hybrid economic systems that performed poorly in the 1990s.",0
77,4,"Lenin and early Soviet defence economists made similar points which were also studied by major countries during World War II. They implemented varying policies in their war economies with different levels of success. Knorr argued in the post-war period that defense potential depends not only on economic power, but also on organisational ability and the share of GDP devoted to defence. Studies on economic power and security have continued up to the present.",0
77,5,"The planned economy of the USSR prioritized the defence sector, giving it access to scarce resources and special organizations like the Military-industrial Commission. These measures were taken to accomplish national security objectives of the state. Even in the Russian Federation, some aspects of the Soviet defence organization remain intact, as stated by Davis in 2002.",0
77,6,"Government policy makers take into consideration both external and domestic threats, such as military, economic, and political factors, when formulating a national security strategy. This strategy includes programs to reduce threats, such as diplomatic efforts, propaganda, arms control, and espionage, as well as military capabilities developed by the defence sector. While the Brezhnev regime in the USSR focused heavily on military power, the strategy shifted towards threat reduction under the Gorbachev government. Similarly, the government of Yeltsin in the Russian Federation placed less emphasis on military power compared to the current government under Putin. This is shown in a quotation on page 6.",0
77,7,"Economic warfare, which involves economic sanctions, is primarily used to influence the economic, technology, and military power balances in favor of the country or alliance conducting it. Punitive measures can include trade embargoes, limited access to trade benefits (MFN status), denial of export licenses, preclusive buying, freezing of assets, restrictions on lending, and expropriation of property. Even during times of peace, technology-leading countries control their technology exports by considering both the features of technologies (like advanced encryption) and potential recipient countries. (Joyner, 2006; Kabrt & Jung, 2015; MacDaniel, 1993; Rode & Jacobsen, 1985) (Baldwin, 1985, p. 41).",0
77,8,"The article defines economic warfare, including sanctions, as a politic-economic process with nine key features, including the trigger, establishment of objectives, and agreement on conditions for termination. These features are discussed throughout historical periods, including the Ukraine conflict, and are summarized in three tables covering Western economic warfare against USSR/Russia during 1917-1945, 1949-1991, and 1992-2016. Additionally, a more detailed assessment of anti-Russia sanctions related to the Ukraine conflict is presented in Table 10, which considers specific measures, goals, and impacts during 2014-2016.",0
77,9,"Following their victory in World War II, the Soviet Union's economy was left severely damaged and distorted towards military efforts. However, by the mid-1950s, they had reduced this burden and entered a period of rapid growth and increasing living standards that lasted into the mid-1970s. Industrial production saw a significant increase, with a peak of 189.1 in 1988. Despite economic warfare from the West, the Soviet Union became the dominant economic power in Europe. While some reforms were introduced, an inefficient shortage economy persisted, leading to decelerating GDP growth and limited technological innovation.",0
77,10,"In the 1970s, the Soviet state monopoly on hard-currency trade expanded due to increases in energy prices and exports of oil and gas, resulting in a rise in energy earnings from $388 million in 1970 to $18,865 million in 1984. To manage this growth, the government created the ＆Rent Management System＊ (RMS), used to distribute the increasing energy value towards financing imports, supporting the defence effort, subsidising inefficient enterprises, and Eastern European countries. (Davis, 2014a; Gaddy & ickes, 2005; Marrese & vanous, 1983).",0
77,11,"During the period of 1950-1973, OECD economies experienced healthy growth rates, followed by a period of 'stagflation' due to oil price shocks that lasted from 1974 to 1980. Despite this setback, they then entered a phase of sustained growth. In the same period, Soviet economic power declined relative to OECD countries, and the technology gap with the USA continued to widen, with a gap of 8-10 years for advanced microcircuits and 9-15 years for mainframe computers in the mid-1980s according to the DOD (US Department of Defense), 1988.",0
77,12,"In the mid-1960s, the Soviet leadership prioritized military power over threat reduction as a means of enhancing national security, as stated by Davis (1992, 2002) and Sapir (1991). This strategy led to a significant rise in resources allocated towards the defense sector, with defense burden rising to around 15% of GDP by the 1980s. Table 1 displays the increases in armed forces and deployed weapons. Although Western economic warfare hindered the USSR's emergence as the second superpower, it did not completely prevent it, as reported by DOD (1981...1990).",0
77,13,"In 1991, both Russia and Ukraine faced the challenge of establishing a market system in a difficult politico-economic environment, as they inherited malfunctioning shortage economies with newly revealed negative value-added components. The weakness of the state in Russia led to a breakdown in the priority protection system and central control of the RMS. Initial macroeconomic stabilisation efforts failed in both countries, resulting in a 40% decline in GDP and high inflation. Microeconomic processes were dominated by barter between firms, informal inter-enterprise debt, second economy activity and corruption. The process of privatisation was ineffective, industrial restructuring was limited, and Foreign Direct Investment was minimal.",0
77,14,"Vladimir Putin has held the position of President of Russia since 2000 and has maintained his dominant leadership role. Although economic reforms have progressed slowly, Russia experienced an average GDP growth of 7% between 2000-2008 due to increased earnings from energy exports. The RMS allowed the government to support welfare programs, subsidize industries with negative value-added, and reduce domestic and international debts. However, informal siphoning of rents and corruption remained prevalent in the Russian economy. The Global Financial Crisis caused temporary negative growth, but stabilisation funds protected the population and economy. Between 2010-2013, GDP grew by 3.4%, inflation remained low, and surpluses were achieved in the state budget and current account, allowing Russia to narrow the economic power gap in Europe (Table 3).",0
77,15,"Ukraine's GDP grew at an average of 7% from 2000 to 2008 but declined by 15% in 2009. From 2010 to 2013, the country experienced a low average growth rate of 2.4% and faced chronic budget and current account deficits, along with a high foreign debt to GDP ratio of 79% in 2013. The country was reliant on Russia for energy supplies and exports of uncompetitive industrial goods, as noted by Gaddy and Ickes (2014a).",0
77,16,"The initial inquiry pertains to the resources that the USSR and NATO countries dedicated to securing their objectives and creating military equilibrium in Europe. After being scarred by the events of World War II, both the USSR and NATO countries committed to channelling their economic prowess into military capabilities and maintaining their readiness for combat. As a result, the USSR allocated roughly 15% of its GDP towards defence in the mid-1980s, whereas democratic NATO nations assumed relatively hefty defence responsibilities during peacetime - the USA (6%), the UK (5%), France (4%), and Germany (3%). Though these military endeavours strained economies (particularly the USSR), and incurred significant opportunity costs, they played a considerable role in establishing peace in Europe, border stability, and nuclear as well as conventional deterrence.",0
77,17,"The Soviet Union's economy was smaller and less technologically advanced than those of its NATO adversaries. However, it developed a military economic system that allowed it to allocate resources efficiently and become the dominant power in Europe. Despite flaws in the general economic and political systems, most institutional features of the Soviet defence sector were carried over to the Russian Federation. In the 1990s, the military-industrial complex experienced severe economic difficulties, but the situation improved in the 2000s as national security programmes became a higher priority. The top leadership, including President Putin, is closely involved in managing the military-industrial complex. Recent conflicts in Ukraine and Syria demonstrate the Russian economy's ability to generate necessary military capabilities and the leadership's willingness to use them.",0
77,18,"Nations and alliances have risen and fallen based on the dynamics of economic, technological and military balances in the past century. This is exemplified by the case of World War II and the Cold War period, where NATO countries had economic power and technological expertise while the USSR maintained military balance through defence economic arrangements. In the post-communist era, NATO countries still possess economic and technological superiority, but Russian defence efforts have caused a shift in the balance of deployed conventional military capabilities in Europe. By 2013, Russia had overwhelming advantages over Ukraine in both economic and military power, contributing to its annexation of Crimea and support for eastern Ukrainian insurgents. This information is demonstrated in Table 5.",0
77,19,"The USA, Japan, and European countries engaged in economic warfare against the USSR throughout 1917-1991, along with supplementary sanctions. However, disagreements between participants led to limited commitments to economic warfare. CoCom's trade controls yielded some successes, but the Spetsinformatsiya system allowed the USSR to obtain controlled goods and secrets through trade diversion and technological espionage. In 1992-2013, the West's efforts to control technology flows to Russia and impose economic sanctions were lower key and fragmented but did achieve specific goals. Overall, Western economic warfare and sanctions did not achieve their intended objectives concerning the alteration of economic and military power balances but slowed the USSR's development into a superpower. (Table 6 and 7 show the economic warfare, while Table 8 shows the efforts made in 1992-2013.)",0
78,1,"The article introduces a roundtable discussion on the World Bank's World Development Report 2009, which focuses on reshaping economic geography. The article discusses the intellectual and political context of the report, highlighting missed opportunities for engagement between the New Economic Geography supported by the World Bank and the pluralist heterodoxy of traditional economic geography. Gillian Hart, Victoria Lawson, and Andr谷s Rodr赤guez-Pose offer commentaries, while World Bank authors Uwe Deichmann, Indermit Gill, and Chor Ching Goh provide a response.",0
78,2,"This compilation of commentaries endeavors to re-examine some of the concerns that motivated the Boston roundtable, now that the complete report has been widely circulated and the initial reactions have subsided. Apart from the understandable subdisciplinary resentment exhibited by some economic geographers, what should we make of the significant arguments presented in the report regarding the correlation between urbanization and long-term economic progress? Is there a conflict between WDR 2009＊s methodology, policy messages and the economic geography practiced by the (small yet heterodox) area that has long identified itself with this label? Shall the conversation between (geographical) economists and (economic) geographers forever be an unproductive exchange? Is it possible that both sides can learn something from each other?",0
78,3,"If the World Bank is the papacy of economic development theology, then a WDR is a significant event that deals with global issues. The WDRs have addressed topics such as the role of the state, gender inequality, climate change, poverty, transition economies, and environmental sustainability. While their ideas may not represent a uniform ""World Bank thinking,"" the WDRs reflect the evolving worldview of the institution and its policymaking intentions. The inclusion of ""economic geography"" in this realm highlights the spatialities of economic development, despite the mixed implications for the academic field of economic geography.",0
78,4,"The WDR 2009 is heavily influenced by the New Economic Geography (NEG), which has had a rocky relationship with traditional economic geography. The report emphasizes the importance of urbanization, a global trend that has accelerated in recent years, and the challenges it poses for social and economic development. The WDR 2009 argues that trade-driven concentration and specialization, as advocated by economist Paul Krugman, are necessary for long-term efficiency and poverty reduction, even if they lead to uneven geographical development. The report is richly illustrated and uses the vocabulary of neoclassical economic geography, while presenting itself as a cosmopolitan guide to policy management.",0
78,5,"The economic geography and development studies/geography of Catholicism is a small ""c"" atheistic version. These two fields have grown independently and exhibit a heterogeneous and skeptical attitude towards any paradigmatic claims, from Marxism to neoclassical economics. The center here has a weak pull, and the zone of interaction includes institutional political economy, postcolonial theory, economic sociology and anthropology, (post)Marxism, socioeconomics, political ecology, feminism, and institutional and evolutionary economics. Economies and economic development are conceived as socially and spatially-constituted phenomena and as sites of (contradictory) economic processes that are never isolated but rather, exist in institutionally-regulated and culturally-embedded forms.",0
78,6,"Economic geography's mutable heterodoxy has proven difficult to characterize even by those within the field. Paul Krugman expressed his apathy towards economic geography-proper, dismissing it as a preoccupation with ""post-Fordism [and] Derrida-influenced regulation school."" While there exists an antagonistic relationship between economic geography and orthodox economics, there are exceptions. The WDR 2009 faced a pluriform negative reception within economic geography and development studies.",0
78,7,"To take advantage of uneven development, a strategy may be implemented with the belief that long-term economic benefits will eventually spread from growth centers to the integrating periphery. While some argue that uneven spatial development may be inevitable, policy measures are still necessary to prevent the negative consequences and social costs in abandoned regions. Allen Scott's research on agglomeration economies highlights the importance of regional institution building in shaping development in growth regions. However, the WDR 2009 has been criticized for having a limited perspective on these considerations as it focuses solely on economic growth.",0
78,8,"The neglect of classical theorists of agglomeration, such as August L?sch, Johann Heinrich von Th邦nen, Alfred Weber, and Edgar Hoover, during the aspatial turn of twentieth-century economics is noted by Harvey, while Scott is perplexed by the narrow reading of economics. The WDR 2009, according to Scott, does not discuss the economics of path dependency, cumulative causation, or institutional economics and comparative political economy. These responses are not solely for the defense of academic naming rights or disciplinary turf. Economic geography has abandoned many of the questions addressed by the NEG, and its renewed engagement with agglomeration economics is more focused on culture and institutions. New intellectual allies have been found in the heterodox economic studies field.",0
78,9,"Economists and geographers have different language and ontological levels. The Rostovian developmental teleology, which focuses on long-term competitive convergence, is difficult to reconcile with the central axioms of contemporary geographical scholarship that emphasize spatial differentiation in economic development, national growth, and urban trajectories. The pluralization of economies in geography acknowledges different economic processes and alternative pathways, while unitary development visions cannot be reconciled with such plural views.",0
78,10,"The WDR 2009's reception in economic geography and development studies has been characterized by an exasperated tone due to the apparent irreconcilability of prevailing intellectual worldviews. The majority of published reviews are concentrated in these fields, while economists have reviewed the report more favorably, albeit not yet in any of their discipline's mainline journals. Some geographers have criticized the report, but Buckley and Buckley's attempt to engage with these critiques has led to a concession of differences while countering that some criticisms are not valid. There is a sense that geographers need to align themselves with encircling and superior forms of economic logic, despite their professional inclination to sustain the contention that ""things are different here."" The Economist has summarized the WDR 2009 by stating that growth is inevitably lumpy, and governments must learn to like it.",0
78,11,"Gillian Hart (2010, 342) takes a different approach by critiquing the neglect of finance markets in the WDR 2009 and the adoption of a ""linear"" model of economic development. Hart notes that the failure of global finance markets in 2008 was linked to the geopolitics of global finance in the post-Bretton Woods era, which has led to the dominance of the US dollar and divided developing nations. She compares China and South Africa's economic strategies, arguing that China's state-led policies have led to higher real wages and accumulated surpluses, while South African firms and elites have moved their portfolios offshore into global financial centers.",0
78,12,"Deichmann, Gill, and Goh (2010) from the World Bank have responded to three positive critiques of the WDR 2009 and defended its focus on policymaking rather than being a laissez-faire or neoliberal analysis. They emphasize the positive reception of the WDR 2009 among policymakers and its diffusion strategy to a range of regional contexts. The involvement of geographers in the framework from the earliest stages is also highlighted. The World Bank team dismisses Hart's argument on finance markets not impeding geographic transformations.",0
78,13,"The current conversation about engaged pluralism between geographers and economists, as called for by Barnes and Sheppard (2010), remains difficult to achieve due to power imbalances favoring economists, as pointed out by Rodr赤guez-Pose (2010). The essays in this collection reveal persistent differences between the two disciplines, with some critical points being left unanswered by economists. Despite the existence of different developmental zones, the ultimate direction seems to be a higher level of market integration.",0
67,1,"This article describes and analyzes the R谷seau de D谷veloppement 谷conomique et d＊Employabilit谷 de la Francophonie Canadienne (RD谷E), a large pan-Canadian network established to support economic development for Francophone minority communities in Canada.The study analyzes the organizational and relational structures of the organizations devoted to supporting minority economic development in Canada and compares their relative importance in different regional contexts. Finally, it discusses whether RD谷E responds to economic necessities and whether it uses recognized economic practices and strategies, while considering the political context behind these initiatives.",1
67,2,"The subject of this article merits attention for three main reasons. First, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have received a large amount of political attention over the past two decades, especially because the government developed an increasing number of industrial and economic policies aimed at promoting and supporting SMEs. This requires a greater response from the government to support and help SMEs in their business activities, because SMEs often face barriers throughout their development or sometimes even lack the competences and resources needed to successfully carry out new business activities (Asheim, Isaksen, Nauwelaers, & T?dtling, 2003).",1
67,3,"Second, although some research has focused on SME support policies, few studies have compared public initiatives, programs, and organizations, and even less so the policies aimed specifically at Francophone minority communities in Canada. Studies that have dealt with French Canadian economic development and business programs are scarce and have mainly looked at the collective efforts to assist and ensure the economic development of Francophone minority communities (Forgues, 2007, 2008) or at their main social and cultural challenges (da Silva & Heller, 2009).",1
67,4,"This article is divided into four sections: We begin with some theoretical considerations about regional economic development, followed by a description of the Francophone minority communities in Canada. This provides a framework for the detailed description of Canadian economic development policies for Francophone communities. Second, we trace the context behind the emergence of Francophone minority programs in Canada and highlight some issues and events related to national unity and their effects on economic development policies. Third, we describe the organizational and relational structure of the economic development program addressed to Francophone communities and entrepreneurs, with a particular emphasis on the place of RD谷E in each Canadian territory and province. We conclude with a discussion of critical issues surrounding RD谷E in an attempt to explain the dichotomization between national unity objectives and economic development.",1
67,5,"The perspectives through which to understand regional economic development are very diverse. In general terms, the different kinds of local and regional development strategies have been articulated with the conceptualization of ※highroad§ and ※low-road§ strategies. The distinction between these potential routes to development relates to the qualitative dimensions of local and regional development (Malecki, 2007; Pyke, Rodriguez-Pose, & Tomaney, 2006). High-road strategies in regional development consider both structural change (i.e., adapting strategies toward the knowledge-based economy) with the imperative of lifestyles and amenities to attract and retain the creative workforce and knowledge industries to maintain and increase regional competitiveness. Low-road strategies in regional development are based on low wages, unskilled labor, low productivity, and low-valueadded activities.",1
67,6,"As economies become more unstable in the globalizing economy, regions need to adopt strategies to maintain or improve their position, regardless of their level of advancement or the sectors in which they specialize (Cooke, Heidenreich, & Braczyk, 2004). The same is true for the structures of governments and governance that are created and implemented and that affect, directly or not, economic development at the regional level. In general, regions aim for the ※high road§ rather than the ※low road§ in development, focusing on building the wealth of the region by enhancing prosperity, improving well-being, and increasing living standards.",1
67,7,"In the different strands of the current literature on regional development, there are five main areas of actions and interventions that emerge from the high-road strategy perspective in regional economic development (Amin, 1999; Malecki, 2007; Porter, 2003; Pyke et al., 2006). The first area of action is the promotion of economic development toward the building of regional clusters (Cooke, 2007; Huggins, 2008; Porter, 2003). It is now accepted that clusters can stimulate the competitiveness and productivity of enterprises as well as support the emergence of new spheres of activity. Successful clusters typically have strong, competitive businesses, appropriate research and education facilities, and supportive labor markets, infrastructure, and policy environments. It is recognized that, together, these features often lead to greater levels of competitiveness and productivity growth (Cumbers & MacKinnon, 2004; Wolfe & Gertler, 2004). Policy action is increasingly centered on supporting clusters or interrelated firms and supportive organizations. Policy makers see in cluster dynamics a new policy tool to promote regional development. In part, the perceived success of Silicon Valley and other clusters in Europe, such as Emilia-Romagna and Baden W邦rttemberg, have encouraged national and local governments to develop their own clusters.",1
67,8,"Second, the experiences of some of the most dynamic regional economies in North America and Europe show the importance of building economies of association within regions (Cooke & Morgan, 1998). Knowledge transmission, production, and innovation occur within institutional, political, and social contexts (Cooke et al., 2004); these activities can be seen as embedded in social relationships. These social relationships develop over time along culturally determined lines. The regional context provides a set of rules, conventions, and norms that prescribe behavioral roles and shape expectations (Edquist, 2005). These rules can be seen as regional assets or as a specific form of capital that is derived from social relations, norms, values, and interaction within a community. The existence of social capital, with trust as an element of social capital, helps overcome market failures or reduce market costs for firms in densely related networks by supporting stable and reciprocal exchange relationships among them (Cooke, 2007; Lichtenstein & Lyons, 2006).",1
67,9,"Fourth, regional government bodies provide the central stimulus to regional economic development and tackle impediments to economic renewal. The idea is to develop what Scott (2007) calls the cognitive-cultural dimension of the regional economy and society. This approach indeed breaks with past policies, notably sectoral policies that disregarded the broader environment. Regions that fare best are those that have invested in their economic, social, cultural, and environmental development and favor the development of a regional economy and society by strengthening their institutional bases (Asheim & Gertler, 2005; Cooke et al., 2004). As such, regional governments have the role to maintain competitiveness in the region and deploy a multitude of strategies that will encourage processes of economic development (Pol豕se & Shearmur, 2006). With these intentions, governments create conditions favoring the development of the regional economy and normally define the formal institutional context in which economic activities are spread. Another important role of the government is to encourage common understanding and support collective practices and representations of economic development in the region (Amin & Thrift, 1994).",1
67,10,"Fifth, there is the promotion of economic initiatives toward the mobilization of diverse social groups and individuals to realize their potentials with the objectives of stimulating job creation and building a regional economy capable of nurturing skills, expertise, and capabilities (Amin, 1999). Targeted groups are vulnerable social groups such as young people, underqualified people, or ethnic and language minorities. Advocating the combination of economic competitiveness and social cohesion for social learning has been termed the new conventional wisdom (Cooke, 2007), especially in the context of regions marked with problems or persistent structural unemployment and weak levels of entrepreneurship.",1
67,11,"It is instructive to highlight how the development trajectories of regions differ from each other. Regions do not all have the same levels of development and complexity. Therefore, they do not experience the same problems or evolve in the same way or at the same rate (Doloreux & Dionne, 2008). Although every region aims for the high-road strategies in economic development, not all regions succeed. Large city regions would appear to be more suitable than smaller areas because of the numerous assets usually found therein, such as universities, a developed knowledge support system, and many innovative businesses (manufacturing and services), all of which enhance regional development and competitiveness (Wolfe & Gertler, 2004).",1
67,12,"To fully understand what Canadian economic policies and programs refer to when addressing linguistic minorities, it is essential to explore the definitions of Francophone and Francophone minority communities. Broadly speaking, according to the Canadian Census and Statistics Canada (2006), a Francophone is a person whose ※mother tongue§ is French and who is still able to speak French at the moment of the inquiry. The definition of Francophone also includes those who answer ※French§ to the question, ※first official language spoken?§ (a way of determining which immigrants are Francophones/Anglophones). Francophone minority communities refers to Francophone communities that are outside of Quebec and in a regional minority context. According to the Official Languages Act (Office of the Commissioner of the Official Languages, 1996), a Francophone minority community is officially recognized to be so when it has a minimum of 10% Francophones or at least 5,000 Francophones in urban areas.",1
67,13,"In total, Francophones outside Quebec account for about 3.2% of the Canadian population and are mainly concentrated in the provinces of Ontario and New Brunswick (see Table 1). These two provinces have adopted the most rigorous legislation related to service access in both official languages in Canada. Furthermore, New Brunswick is the only Canadian province that has chosen an official bilingual status, thereby offering access to services in both official languages. The Francophone population in the remaining provinces and territories varies between 0.5% (Newfoundland and Labrador) and 4.4% (Prince Edward Island); legislation regarding access to services in French is underdeveloped in these areas.",1
67,14,"Based on the reality of the two language groups and their disparities, it is surprising to note that little attention has been paid to the application of economic development initiatives and business or entrepreneurial programs tailored to specifically address language differences. The federal government had previously calculated that policies reinforcing institutional bilingualism would contribute to the development of official language minorities＊ communities, but it became clearer in the mid-1990s that direct efforts were needed to more directly confront the risks posed to national unity and the economic disparities of linguistic groups. A consensus emerged that new linguistic economic development tools were needed more than traditional language measures. In 1997, the government created the National Centre of Economic Development and Employability; this Committee is at the origin of a complex web of organizations, partnerships, and programs designed to turn the Official Languages Act＊s recommendations into policies to readdress the economic gap between linguistic communities. Thus, the economic aspect of language policies became more explicit and even evolved as independent policies.",1
67,15,"With respect to the organizational structure, RD谷E adopts horizontal governing methods, using existing community networks to empower community actors while taking into account their specific needs and aspirations. Since its creation, RD谷E has established numerous links with existing local Francophone associations for economic development. It has also created new structures or organizations where none already existed.",1
67,16,"The RD谷E in each of the four Western provinces operates within the Western Canada Business Network; each Western provincial RD谷E is thus accountable to WEDC. Therefore, unlike the other regions that we will examine below, the structure of Francophone economic development in Western Canada favors a top-down approach. In 2001, WEDC established partnerships between the Francophone communities and the four Western RD谷Es to create the Francophone Economic Development Organization (FEDO) to achieve the objectives of the federal government＊s social and language policies. WEDC formulates the policies for Francophone development in the four provinces through its FEDO program. FEDO＊s governing boards are made up of volunteers who mainly come from the business community, which favors a transmission of knowledge regarding the specific economic challenges facing Francophone entrepreneurs. FEDO also provides a range of services exclusively targeting Francophone business development, which fall in three categories: and (a) provide consulting services, information, and training resources; (b) coordinate loans and grants; and (c) assist the economic development of Francophone communities with a wide range of services such as individual counseling; referral services; and assistance in enterprise planning, training services, workshops, forums, and conferences.",1
67,17,"The Business Development Program was designed to assist business start-ups, modernization, and expansion. Its main objectives include developing and valorizing entrepreneurship, increasing the number of new businesses, improving their competitiveness, and stimulating innovation and generating growth through product and market development. In 1995, this program officially became the main tool enabling ACOA to provide direct assistance for business development. Furthermore, the Cooperation Program joins the efforts of the federal and provincial governments, universities, research institutes, and private sector companies to strengthen Atlantic Canada＊s economy. It is essentially through the Cooperation Program that ACOA contributes to the economic prosperity of communities in general as well as of French minority communities and Francophone entrepreneurs.",1
67,18,"In New Brunswick, two main organizations support Francophone entrepreneurship: the New Brunswick Economic Board and the Community Business Development Corporations. The New Brunswick Economic Board was given the mandate to create RD谷E-New Brunswick and mainly offers economic workshops and promotes networking between businesses to stimulate Francophone entrepreneurship, whereas the Community Business Development Corporations produce studies to assist and support business strategies and projects. Community Business Development Corporations also contribute to the creation of new businesses and the expansion and modernization of already established enterprises and offer counseling services and assistance for entrepreneurial development, training, and technical assistance. Community Business Development Corporations do not exclusively provide services to Francophone entrepreneurs, but they help establish partnerships with other organizations addressing Francophones＊ development and entrepreneurship projects, such as RD谷E-New Brunswick and the New Brunswick Economic Board.",1
67,19,"In Nova Scotia, three organizations address Francophone economic development: the Economic Development Council, RD谷E-Nova Scotia, and the Business and Entrepreneurship Support Center. The Economic Development Council is responsible for the other two organizations. The Economic Development Council was in charge of establishing RD谷ENova Scotia and is working for the improvement and economic well-being of the Acadian and Francophone population of Nova Scotia. More specifically, its mandate is to support economic development in targeted regions, mainly by promoting and supporting Francophone businesses. The Economic Development Council is directly funded by ACOA and thus acts as an intermediary between RD谷E and ACOA. In parallel, RD谷E-Nova Scotia is active in the promotion of economic development and has the mandate of providing the necessary tools to achieve diversification and economic growth. Last, the Business and Entrepreneurship Support Center offers services to entrepreneurs and has established a business support center in partnership with St. Anne University.",1
67,20,"In this study, we have analyzed the main organizations and initiatives supporting regional economic development in Canadian Francophone minority communities. We began by developing a theoretical framework to identify five main areas of intervention to support regional economic development. This framework highlighted the importance of adopting high-road strategies in regions to maintain and sustain regional competitiveness through different initiatives such as building clusters, developing social capital and relationships, coordinating economic activities, promoting regional governance, and, finally, integrating social economy. The empirical part of the article focused on RD谷E, an organization that addresses the specific needs of Francophone minority communities in Canada.",1
67,21,"What follows are the key points of this article. On the positive side, RD谷E aims at developing social capital and networks among Francophones in different minority communities. It is commendable for the Canadian government to make efforts so that its minority communities can prosper while preserving their cultures and using the language of their choice. But this study suggests that RD谷E is perhaps more efficient or concerned with its underlying political functions than with its intended economic goals. RD谷E promotes Canadian unity by showing that the government pays attention to its Francophone minority communities, but it is less clear whether its desire to palliate the economic disadvantage of Francophone minority communities is grounded in a clear understanding of their needs and the best measures to respond to them. Moreover, the way RD谷E＊s activities are designed and distributed across the country suggests that the organization has not fully considered how to adapt its activities to regional particularities and dynamics.",1
67,22,"Furthermore, we question why the four orientations should respond to the needs of the Francophone population in particular. Any gap or economic disadvantage experienced by the Francophone population that is explicitly attributable to the language variable should benefit from government intervention to make sure that the choice of living or doing business in French is not detrimental to development. Otherwise, it is reasonable to say that the best initiatives deployed for one language group should be similar to those deployed for the other. It is not clear why Francophones are especially in need of intervention in the four sectors. For example, if it is established that Francophones are underrepresented in the tourism industry because of communication issues linked to client demography, then the RD谷E tourism orientation is justified if it addresses that deficit. In short, the government should make sure that being Francophone does not translate into an economic disadvantage and that Francophones have equal access to services, information, support, and economic opportunities.",1
67,23,"Our study also reveals the significant variation in the way RD谷E has integrated existing structures in each territory. For example, WEDC has adopted a top-down approach and created the FEDO program that standardizes RD谷E＊s activities in the Western provinces. On the other hand, ACOA has favored a bottom-up approach, meaning that RD谷E in the Atlantic provinces can address Francophone minority communities＊ needs without having to comply with any of ACOA＊s specific guidelines related to the Official Language Act. ACOA＊s structure, which can be characterized as more horizontal, seems to conform more closely with the original mandate of RD谷E, as the agency does not interfere with the activities of each provincial RD谷E and Francophone organization. Furthermore, in Atlantic Canada, we witnessed a more complex network taking shape between ACOA, Francophone associations, and economic development organizations. This less standardized, relational strategy allows greater freedom and responsibilities to Francophone economic development organizations and the RD谷E, although this also augments the risk of overlaps. A last example is FedNor, which targets specific regions and directs its activities exclusively toward rural and northern Ontario.",1
68,1,"Various international comparisons of subjective well-being show that the average level of happiness in a nation is significantly related to its political institutions. Examining a sample of industrialised market economics, this paper explores whether the same relationship holds for economic institutions as well. Holding other determinants of happiness constant, no significant relationships between happiness and type of economic system are found. Some conjectures explaining this asymmetry between happiness and economic and political systems are explored.",1
68,2,"Many studies on the determinants of happiness or subjective well-being (SWB) have explored the impact of particular demographic variables (sex, age, marital status, etc) and also of economic and political performance variables, such as unemployment status, inflation rates, efficiency of government services, civil liberties, and so on. Political and economic systems and the institutions composing them may be another source of SWB but, until recently, their impact has received relatively little attention. In recent years, however, Frey and his colleagues (eg, Frey and Stutzer, 2000, 2002; and Frey, 2008) have shown that SWB varies between Swiss cantons according to the degree of direct democracy; and Helliwell (2002) and Helliwell and Huang (2006) provide cross-country evidence that citizens are happier in nations with constitution establishing presidential systems and some form of proportional voting.",1
68,3,"The relation between economic systems and happiness has received virtually no serious theoretical or empirical analysis in the scholarly literature in any discipline. In the popular media one sometimes finds two types of vague arguments about this relationship: (a) Some leftwing commentators assert that happiness is greatest in ＆gentle＊ welfare states, such as the Nordic nations, while it is lowest in English-speaking nations with their alleged ＆dog-eat-dog＊ capitalism. Some rightwing commentators assert the opposite, that Nordic economic systems stifle initiative and frustrate would-be entrepreneurs, while lassez faire capitalism allows people to reach their greatest potential and, thus, become happier. (b) Others seem to say that most people are unmoved by abstract economic arguments and view the economic system instrumentally, that is, they are more concerned with the performance of the economy, rather than the system per se. As the economic performance of the four capitalist economic systems studied in this note are roughly similar by most criteria (Pryor, 2008), this argument can be taken to imply that there is no significant difference in happiness in countries with these different systems.",1
68,4,"This study is motivated by three concerns: (a) to explore empirically whether the relation found between the political system and happiness also holds for the economic system so that a stylised fact can be established, which can provide a focus on future theoretical economic analysis; (b) to determine which economic institutions are responsible for this relationship, assuming that such a correlation between system and happiness can be found; (c) and to test empirically the two ideological conjectures outlined in the previous paragraph",1
68,5,"The next section focuses on three methodological issues: the measurement of happiness, the selection of the sample, and the definition of the economic systems. The subsequent section surveys 53 possible determinants of happiness on a national level and explains why and how I have used principal component analysis to reduce these possible explanatory variables to a manageable number. The next following section presents the results of the regression analysis attempting to relate economic system to the level of happiness. The penultimate section explodes several objections to this type of analysis. The final section summarises the results and explores in greater detail why economic systems do not influence SWB, whereas political systems do.",1
68,6,"Hundreds of public opinion surveys pose questions of the following type to measure SWB or happiness (I use the terms interchangeably): All things considered, how happy would you say that you are on a scale from 0 through 10? Sometimes the question is asked in terms of life satisfaction, but the results are roughly the same (Veenhoven, 2000, esp. pp. 268每273). The results of these surveys have been standardised and summarised in the World Database of Happiness.",1
68,7,Several serious questions can be immediately raised about the meaningfulness of these tabulated answers: Are people telling the truth? Do the SWB scales yield comparable scores across individuals and societies? Are people＊s answers consistent over time? Are international comparisons biased by cultural norms concerning the propriety of talking about one＊s individual happiness? Such questions have been explored at considerable length in the literature on happiness; the general consensus is that in industrial nations the answers to these survey questions about SWB do reflect an important reality independent of cultural differences and the answers can be meaningfully compared from country to country.,1
68,8,"This leaves us with a group of 21 nations, all members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which, as shown below, have different economic systems. All are democracies and their political systems also have many features in common. Most also have relatively similar levels of economic development. Their similarities in the cultural and political dimensions give us more confidence that any discovered differences in their average levels of happiness do not arise from these causes. Although the sample is small, the use of a regression analysis with careful attention to statistical significance of the estimated coefficient means that we can have some confidence in the derived conclusions.",1
68,9,"An economic system can be defined as a set of complementary economic institutions and organisations that directly influence the allocation of resources. It differs from the political system because these institutions are primarily concerned with property relations or with the production and distribution of goods and services, rather than the exercise of political power. Of course, many economic institutions have important political elements, for example, government regulation, but a definition of the economic system focuses on how and to what degree such regulation influences resource allocation, whereas a definition of a political system deals with how the regulators are appointed and how they respond to the people＊s will. Thus, definitions of economic and political systems may deal with the same phenomenon, but from different perspectives.",1
68,10,"Although many designate economic systems in terms of one or two institutions (eg, a welfare state), the approach taken in this essay is more comprehensive and takes into account 40 institutions, measured by quantitative indicators representing various institutions in the market for goods and services (eg, product market regulation or barriers to starting new businesses), the labour market (eg, coverage of collective bargaining agreements or protection of jobs), the production and business sector (eg, concentration of corporate ownership or shareholder rights), the government sector (eg, government＊s share in total investment or share of employment in government owned enterprises), and the financial sector (eg, central bank independence or bank concentration).",1
68,11,"The 40 institutional variables were then subjected to a cluster analysis, a procedure that searches for complementarities between the defining characteristics (institutions) to determine which groups of countries feature roughly similar institutional configurations. Diagram 1 presents an example using just two, rather than 40, institutions. The axes A and B indicate the institutions used to define the economic system, for example, the ratio of government expenditures to the GDP and the degree to which wages are bargained at the national rather than the industrial level. The x＊s define a country＊s location in this two-dimensional institutional space and the spaces enclosed by the solid lines indicate the institutional clusters, which, in turn, define the three economic systems Q, R, and S (Figure 1).",1
68,12,"Using the 40 institutional variables, the actual systems derived by this method reveal four clusters: Anglo-Saxon, Nordic, Western European, and Southern European. Such a classification of the economic systems of the OECD nations is not startling, and other economists using different methods and criteria have arrived at a similar classification of OECD economic systems.",1
68,13,"As shown in Part B of Table 1, the average level of happiness does not vary greatly from one economic system to another. Indeed, only the Nordic and the Southern European nations are significantly different (at the 0.05 level of significance). If we follow the approach of Stevenson and Wolfers (2008) and add the logarithm of per capita GDP to the regression to hold constant this possible determinant, then none of the systems variable proves to be significantly related to the measure of happiness.",1
68,14,"The second problem arises because the number of possible determinants is considerably greater than the size of the sample. More specifically, among the various cross-national studies of happiness, there is no agreement about which are the most important determinants. In going through a wide swath of the literature, I found 53 likely determinants of SWB proposed by others that deserve examination, for instance, achievement motivation, belief in control versus fate, materialism, suicide, work values, subjective health ratings, fertility, inflation, and so on. This heterogeneous (and, at first sight, seemingly strange) list includes variables reflecting performance outcomes (social, economic, political, economic, or health) and cultural conditions and attitudes. None of these indicators, shown in Table 2 (and discussed in greater detail in Pryor, website), are included in the institutional variables defining the economic system. Obviously, for my sample of 21 nations these 53 possible determinants could not all be separately handled and statistically tested at the same time.",1
68,15,"A simple solution for both of the problems noted above is to reduce the number of possible determinants through a principal component analysis. This procedure isolates combinations of determinants that are highly correlated and, in the process, eliminates problems of multicollinearity among the possible independent variables. After the calculation of each component of the determinants of happiness, its impact is removed and a new principal component is calculated from the remaining data, so that the final result is a series of combined variables (principal components) that can be examined for their possible causal impact on the happiness variable.",1
68,16,"The data presented in Table 2 shows the correlation of the first three principal components with each of the 53 possible determinants, with the correlation coefficient indicating the relative importance of each determinant in the particular principal component. These components, each with an eigenvalue greater than 3.6, account for 54.1% of the total variance of the sample. Although interpretation of a single component is sometimes difficult, that is not important because each component represents the unifying element of the various possible determinants of happiness of which it is most significantly related.",1
68,17,"For the regressions including only one principal component and the economic system, the results are meager and primarily show a significant difference only between the Nordic and Southern European economic systems for the third components, holding the other determinants constant. When the three components are included with the three economic systems, none of the economic systems appears significantly different from the Nordic countries.",1
68,18,"The other explanatory variables are the various derived components of the possible causal variables. The key question to be answered is whether the individual economic systems have an impact on happiness, as measured by the calculated coefficient in the various regressions. The first three regressions show how happiness relates to each of the separate principal components and to dummy variables representing the different economic systems. The fourth regression includes all of the principal components and economic systems; and the last regression includes just the principal components and economic systems together.",1
68,19,"The regressions discussed above show that the economic system does not seem to have a significant impact on SWB of the population. Contrary to ideological assertions, the population in ＆gentle＊ Nordic economic system and those in the ＆ferocious＊ Anglo-Saxon economic systems show no significant difference in their average level of happiness, other factors held constant. However, two possible objections can be immediately raised.",1
68,20,"This can be easily tested by examining the correlation between the four individual economic systems and the three calculated components of the determinants of happiness. Eight of the 12 regressions show no significant relationships between economic system and a component of happiness. The Nordic and Southern European economic systems are, respectively, significantly positively and negatively related to the first principal component. The Anglo-Saxon and Nordic economic system are, respectively, significantly positively and negatively related to the second principal component. Such results suggest that in these cases, multicollinearity between the economic system and the principal component might have some impact on the results in Table 3 to reduce the relationship between happiness with the economic system and component variables in one third of the cases. This impact, however, appears minor.",1
68,21,"The second possible objection to the conclusion that the economic system has no impact on happiness concerns the determinants of the different economic systems. I have presented evidence elsewhere (Pryor, 2007) that individuals in countries with the same economic system have similar roughly economic beliefs and values, which are somewhat different from those in countries with other economic systems at the same level of economic development. If these underlying economic beliefs and values determining the systems are highly correlated with the economic values determining the three principal components of the determinants of happiness, then multicollinearity may underlie the lack of significant t-scores for the economic systems.",1
68,22,"First, the political system has a more immediate or visible impact on people＊s lives than the economic system, which is more abstract. For instance, a referendum is an aspect of the political system of which people are directly aware. As the political system concerns the way decisions are made, the population can also more easily understand the system. In contrast, the economic system consists of many different and seemingly disparate institutions, so that the system as a whole comprised of these institutions are less apparent and people participating in the economy are not selfconsciously taking part in an economic system.",1
68,23,"Second, people may feel that they have little impact on changing the economic system than the political system, where they can vote for change. Their experience of voting and participating in activities to pressure the government for reform is more direct and focused than their experience with the economic system, where change is rarely linked to individuals and, moreover, is viewed as very much less possible except under revolutionary circumstances or during economic crises. In other words, happiness is more influenced by expectations of possible change, not when such expectations are habitually low: because the economic system is viewed as unalterable, people simply adapt to it and continue their lives. This parallels the result discussed in the happiness literature that paraplegics and others who have been seriously injured in accidents adapt in time to their new circumstances and have (in the long term, but not shortly after their misfortune) close to the same level of happiness as before.",1
69,1,"Based on the existing literature, this paper discusses the relationship between economic transition and corruption, and argues that economic transition is one of the main roots of the spread of corruption in transitional China. It divides economic transition into four parts, and examines various channels by which economic transition breeds corruption opportunities. By applying the case statistical analysis method to analyze 594 major corruption cases, it finds the most corruption-prone areas, and provides some empirical evidence on the existence of such channels.",1
69,2,"For thousands of years, corruption has remained a cancer in the human society. It exists in almost all countries, ancient or modern, developing or developed. In China, the rapid spread of corruption accompanied its great transition from a centrally planned economy system to a socialist market economy system. Corruption has not only threatened the economy development but also undermined social stability. What are the main causes of the spread of corruption in transitional China? What are the relations between the economic transition and the spread of corruption?",1
69,3,"At present, the internationally prevailing theory in interpreting the spread of corruption in a country is the ＆modernization theory＊, developed by American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington. However, such a theory has found itself in a tight corner in explaining the corruption in Eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union during their transition periods. Based on the theory, some scholars have found how corruption in transitional China affects economic transition. However, it is a pity that few of these studies have provided any empirical results. That is just what this paper aims to do. This discussion can also help deepen Huntington＊s theory, and attract more attention to institutional involvement in the fight against corruption in China.",1
69,4,"On the basis of observing corruption in the United States in the nineteenth century and in the UK in the eighteenth century, Samuel P. Huntington (1989) developed a theory which argued that modernization causes corruption. He holds that the level of corruption is associated with rapid social and economic modernization. He lists three channels by which modernization influences the level of corruption. First, modernization has changed the basic values of society. Second, modernization has opened up new sources of wealth and power, thus stimulating acts of corruption. Third, modernization, through changes caused by the output of the political system, has accelerated corruption.",1
69,5,"Huntington＊s opinion is among the most popular theories to explain the change of the level of corruption in certain countries. The empirical research by Larrain and Tavares (2000) also shows that the higher the economic development level, the lower the level of corruption is. However, Huntington＊s theory cannot explain the spread of corruption in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in their transition periods, as their economies were plunged into serious recessions in the period rather than experiencing modernization. In addition, some scholars have pointed out that a balanced social structure may help control corruption in a country (Benson 1990; Johnston 1995). Some others opine that if a country increases the average wage of its public sector or increases the possibility that corrupt activities will be discovered and punished, the level of corruption will reduce remarkably.",1
69,6,"From the early 1980s, some scholars began to focus on the economic transition and spread of corruption in transitional China, which had adopted a gradual transition strategy characterized by the dual-track system. Hao and Johnston (2006) pointed out that China＊s reform had greatly increased opportunities and incentives for corruption. It was one of the main reasons for the surge of corruption in China＊s economic reform era. Wu (1999) used the rent-seeking theory to analyze the rents and the corruption opportunities caused by the rents in the process of dualtrack reform, and pointed out that they were the root of official profiteering (guan dao). Gong (1994) argued that corruption in the 1980s was the inevitable result of the reform. Lu (2000) analyzed the corruption in the transition period and held that it was product of the reform of the administrative system. Some scholars also found an impact of institutional revolution in other countries＊ experiences. Girling (1997) studied corruption in Thailand＊s democratization in the 1950s, and showed that this process had created enormous opportunities for corruption. RoseAckerman (2000) and Kaufmann and Siegelbaum (1996) held that privatization provided public officials with enormous opportunities for rent-seeking, while Fisman and Gatti (2000) and Pei (2000) both opined that corruption was closely associated with decentralization. ",1
69,7,"Economic transition in this paper refers to the institution evolving from the centrally planned economy to the market economy. After 1978, China experienced a process of economic reform first and followed by economic transition. Economic reform means an improvement of the pre-existing centrally planned economy system, and economic transition refers to the introduction of a new economic system intended to replace the old one. Economic reform is therefore different from economic transition. However, for ease, in this paper economic reform and economic transition are collectively referred to as economic transition.",1
69,8,"Corresponding to the five characters of the centrally planned economy system, this paper divides China＊s economic transition into four areas: economic liberalization, decentralization, privatization and economic globalization. Economic liberalization refers to the steady rise in the market economy＊s percentage of the whole economy and the gradual reduction of the government＊s interference in economic activities (including deregulation of prices and opening of the market). Decentralization of power means the process of the central government＊s empowering of local governments and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). It includes administrative decentralization and fiscal decentralization. Privatization points to the increase in the private sector compared with the entire economy. A number of private enterprises emerged and some SOEs and resources were privatized. Economic globalization refers to the growing economic interplay and internationalization, including the inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI), international trade and the cross-border exchange of personnel. The four parts constitute the main contents of China＊s economic transition from 1978 to the present. The four parts, although not carried out simultaneously, were interconnected.",1
69,9,"Economic liberalization may breed corruption in two ways. First, in the dual-pricing reform, some public officials misused public power for rent-seeking. They moved the scarce resources in the centrally planned economy system to the market, and got huge and quick profits. Second, some public officials controlled the market entrance, and asked for bribery in the process of administrative approvals. They often colluded with the emerging economy entities (mainly private enterprises) and protected their illegal activities.",1
69,10,"Privatization may breed corruption in two ways. First, some businessmen had state-owned assets under-evaluated by offering bribes and then bought them at a low price. Second, private enterprises, which emerged and got rich in the economic transition, lacked political support and so tried to get protection by bribing officials. This increased the demand in the corruption market.",1
69,11,"Corruption, by its nature, is hidden and sensitive. We cannot ascertain what actually goes on. One of the main means for us to study corruption is to analyze those corruption cases that have been discovered and try to find out how corruption is generated. However, it is insufficient to focus only on the number of cases discovered or punished every year, because cases may differ a great deal even though they are discovered at the same time. If corruption activities in two cases occurred at different times, they may reflect different institution loopholes in different fields. Therefore, in order to explore the micro-mechanism by which corruption occurred, we need details of the corruption cases in order to discover their statistical characters. Only in this way can we grasp the orderliness of corruption. This paper therefore applies the corruption case statistical analysis method (Guo 2008) to study corruption in transitional China.",1
69,12,"Owing to the sensitive nature of corruption, no country would make all information regarding its corruption cases open to the public. China is no exception. Up to the present, we are unable to make more reliable, comprehensive or sample statistical analyses on all corruption cases discovered and punished during China＊s transition period. What we can do, however, is to make a second-best choice: take the corruption cases published by official files, publications and media reports as objects of study and make a statistical analysis.",1
69,13,"Obviously, neither Database A nor Database B is perfect. Database A may be regarded as a scientific sampling of corruption cases involving senior officials, as cases covered therein basically include all corruption cases discovered and punished from 1978 involving senior officials.2 The inadequacies of Database A are its comparatively small quantity of samples and its vulnerability to influence by political power in investigating potentially corrupt senior officials. Cases in Database B are not selected randomly, nor does it cover all cases discovered and punished in China＊s transition period involving middle level officials. But Database B has a relatively high number of samples, making analysis on the distribution of corruption-prone areas more persuasive. Furthermore, a comparison between these two databases can reveal differences in patterns of corruption by officials at different levels.",1
69,14,"Based on the two databases, we analyzed the types of corruption activities by public officials in accordance with the public interests involved. We identified five major types of causes of corruption, including administrative examination and approval, personnel management, administrative interference, government procurement and conflict of interests. Cases in the two databases are further divided into smaller categories according to their purposes, and the numbers of corruption cases by public officials in Database A and Database B are calculated, as shown in Table 2.",1
69,15,"As Table 2 shows corruption cases by public officials reveal that loan distribution and guarantee, personnel promotion and contracting out of construction projects are the most corruptionprone areas. This is consistent with our observation and what has been emphasized by the work of China＊s anti-corruption authorities in recent years. Corruption in administrative examination and approval and conflict of interests are both associated with the economic activities that emerged after the beginning of China＊s economic transition. The difference is that, in the former, public servants who abuse their public power to seek rent, do not directly participate in economic activities, while, in the latter, public servants run businesses personally or support their family members in running the businesses. In the conflict-of-interests situation, it seems that public servants themselves do not benefit directly from such activities, but there are severe conflicts of interests. Corruption in administrative interference has certain relations with government power and is one of the features left over from the planned economy system. In addition, its role in the generation of corruption has become even more prominent due to China＊s decentralization of power. ",1
69,16,"This paper provides some empirical evidence on the relationship between economic transition and the spread of corruption in transitional China. It identifies several channels through which economic transition breeds opportunities for corruption, the corruption-prone areas and the institutional causes of corruption. It would be helpful for anticorruption practices in China. After recognizing the relationship between the economic transition and the spread of corruption, we may know better the current corruption situation in China and how we can fight it successfully.",1
67,1,"The article assesses the RD谷E, a network established to assist the economic growth of Francophone minority communities throughout Canada. It evaluates the organizational and relational structures of organizations dedicated to minority economic development while examining their relative significance in various regional settings.  Additionally, the article explores whether the RD谷E is attuned to economic necessities and if it implements recognized economic tactics and strategies, all while taking into account the political context influencing such initiatives.",0
67,2,"The article's focus warrants consideration for three primary justifications. Firstly, there has been a significant amount of political emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) during the last two decades. This is primarily due to the government's adoption of numerous industrial and economic policies that are intended to bolster and support SMEs. Because SMEs often experience hindrances throughout their growth process or lack the expertise and resources needed to undertake new business operations successfully, the government must respond more promptly to support and assist them in their business activities (Asheim, Isaksen, Nauwelaers, & T?dtling, 2003).",0
67,3,"Although SME support policies have been researched, there is a lack of studies that compare various public initiatives, programs, and organizations, particularly those aimed at Francophone minority communities in Canada. Previous studies focused on French Canadian economic development and business programs are rare and have primarily examined collective efforts to aid and promote the economic development of these communities (Forgues, 2007, 2008) or the primary social and cultural obstacles they confront (da Silva & Heller, 2009).",0
67,4,"The article is structured into four parts. The first part includes theoretical considerations about regional economic development, followed by a description of Francophone minority communities in Canada. The second part discusses the emergence of Francophone minority programs in Canada and their impact on economic development policies due to national unity issues. The third part describes the organizational structure of the economic development program aimed at Francophone communities and entrepreneurs, with emphasis on RD谷E in each Canadian province and territory. Finally, the fourth section discusses critical issues surrounding RD谷E and the dichotomy between national unity objectives and economic development.",0
67,5,"The understanding of regional economic development can be looked at from various perspectives. The approaches to local and regional development are often categorized as ""high-road"" and ""low-road"" strategies based on the quality of the development. High-road strategies focus on structural changes, such as adapting to the knowledge-based economy, as well as providing lifestyle amenities to attract and retain a creative workforce and knowledge-based industries to enhance regional competitiveness. In contrast, low-road strategies are based on utilizing low wages, unskilled labor, low productivity, and low-value added activities. (Malecki, 2007; Pyke, Rodriguez-Pose, & Tomaney, 2006).",0
67,6,"In the globalizing economy, as economies become more unstable, regions must adopt strategies to either maintain or improve their position, regardless of their level of advancement or sector specialization. This applies to the structures of governments and governance that impact economic development at the regional level. Generally, regions strive to take the ""high road"" in development, prioritizing enhancing prosperity, improving well-being, and increasing living standards to build the wealth of the region. (Cooke, Heidenreich, & Braczyk, 2004)",0
67,7,"In the realm of regional development literature, the high-road strategy perspective suggests five key areas of action and interventions (Amin, 1999; Malecki, 2007; Porter, 2003; Pyke et al., 2006). The first focus is on promoting economic development through regional cluster building, which is widely recognized to enhance competitiveness and productivity while creating new areas of activity (Cooke, 2007; Huggins, 2008; Porter, 2003). Successful clusters typically feature strong businesses, education and research facilities, supportive labor markets, infrastructure, and policy environments (Cumbers & MacKinnon, 2004; Wolfe & Gertler, 2004). As such, policymakers increasingly view clusters as a valuable tool for driving regional development, with inspiration drawn from well-known clusters like Silicon Valley, Emilia-Romagna, and Baden W邦rttemberg.",0
67,8,"The significance of developing regional economies of association has been highlighted by the success of dynamic regional economies in North America and Europe. The transmission, production, and innovation of knowledge are all embedded in political, institutional, and social contexts and are reliant on social relationships that develop over time. Cultural determinants also play a role in shaping social relationships. Regional contexts provide a framework of conventions, norms, and rules that dictate behavioral roles and shape expectations. These behavioral rules contribute to regional assets or a specific form of capital that derives from social relations, norms, values, and interaction within a community. Social capital, with trust as a component, can overcome market failures or reduce market costs for firms in densely related networks. This is achieved by supporting stable and reciprocal exchange relationships within such networks.",0
67,9,"Regional government bodies play a vital role in promoting regional economic development and overcoming obstacles to economic growth. This involves developing the cognitive-cultural aspect of the regional economy and society, which is a departure from past sectoral policies. The most successful regions are those that invest in their economic, social, cultural, and environmental development and strengthen their institutional bases. Regional governments are responsible for maintaining competitiveness in the region and implementing various strategies to promote economic development. They also create favorable conditions for economic activities and encourage collective practices and representations of economic development in the region.",0
67,10,"The fifth strategy involves promoting economic initiatives that aim to mobilize diverse social groups to realize their potential. The objective is to stimulate job creation and build a regional economy capable of nurturing skills, expertise, and capabilities. This strategy focuses on vulnerable social groups, such as young people, underqualified individuals, and ethnic and language minorities. Combining economic competitiveness with social cohesion for social learning is now widely accepted as the new conventional wisdom, particularly in regions facing persistent structural unemployment and weak levels of entrepreneurship (Cooke, 2007) (Amin, 1999).",0
67,11,"It is important to note that regions have unique development trajectories, varying in both complexity and level. Consequently, they encounter distinct challenges and progress at different rates (Doloreux & Dionne, 2008). While all regions aim for high-road economic development strategies, success may not be universal. Larger city regions, which usually boast advanced knowledge support systems, universities, and innovative businesses in manufacturing and services, are generally more suitable for comprehensive regional development (Wolfe & Gertler, 2004).",0
67,12,"It is crucial to delve into the definitions of Francophone and Francophone minority communities to comprehend the Canadian economic policies and programs concerning linguistic minorities. As per the Canadian Census and Statistics Canada (2006), Francophone means a person whose primary language is French and can still speak French at the time of the survey. The definition also includes individuals who respond ""French"" to the question, ""first official language spoken?"" to determine whether immigrants are Francophones/Anglophones. Francophone minority communities denote Francophone communities located outside Quebec in a regional minority context. As per the Official Languages Act (Office of the Commissioner of the Official Languages, 1996), a community becomes an official Francophone minority when it comprises a minimum of 10% Francophones or at least 5,000 Francophones in urban areas.",0
67,13,"Francophone Canadians outside of Quebec make up approximately 3.2% of the total population and are primarily located in Ontario and New Brunswick. These two provinces have implemented the most stringent laws regarding language access for services, with New Brunswick being the only province to have official bilingual status. The percentage of Francophones in other provinces and territories ranges from 0.5% in Newfoundland and Labrador to 4.4% in Prince Edward Island. These regions have not yet developed comprehensive legislation concerning French language access for services. 

The revised paragraph provides the same information as the original but has been reworded to improve clarity and readability.",0
67,14,"It is surprising that little attention has been given to economic development initiatives and entrepreneurial programs that address language disparities between two language groups. While the federal government had previously focused on institutional bilingualism policies to support official language minorities, it became clear in the mid-1990s that more direct efforts were needed to address national unity and economic inequalities between linguistic groups. There was a consensus that new linguistic economic development tools were necessary to complement traditional language measures. To this end, the National Centre of Economic Development and Employability was created in 1997, leading to the creation of a vast network of organizations, partnerships, and programs aimed at readdressing the economic gap between linguistic communities. As a result, the economic aspect of language policies has become more explicit and has evolved as an independent policy.",0
67,15,"RD谷E utilizes a horizontal governing approach in its organizational structure, leveraging community networks to empower community members and their unique needs and goals. From its inception, RD谷E has collaborated with various local Francophone associations focused on economic development and even established new organizations where they were previously lacking.",0
67,16,"Unlike the other regions examined below, the structure of Francophone economic development in Western Canada follows a top-down approach. The RD谷E in each of the four Western provinces operates within the Western Canada Business Network, and each provincial RD谷E is accountable to WEDC. In 2001, WEDC formed partnerships with the Francophone communities and the four Western RD谷Es to create the Francophone Economic Development Organization (FEDO) to achieve the objectives of the federal government＊s social and language policies. FEDO's governing boards comprise mostly volunteers from the business community, who can provide knowledge on specific economic challenges facing Francophone entrepreneurs. WEDC creates the policies for Francophone development through its FEDO program, which offers a variety of services targeted at Francophone business development. These services fall into three categories: (a) consulting services, information, and training; (b) loan and grant coordination; and (c) a wide range of assistance for the economic development of Francophone communities, including individual counseling, referral services, and assistance with enterprise planning, training services, workshops, forums, and conferences.",0
67,17,"The aim of the Business Development Program is to help businesses that are starting up or looking to modernize and expand. Its goals are to develop entrepreneurship, improve competitiveness, and encourage innovation to drive growth in product and market development. Since 1995, this program has been the primary tool used by ACOA to provide direct support for business development. Additionally, the Cooperation Program brings together federal and provincial governments, universities, research institutions, and private companies to enhance the economy of Atlantic Canada. Through this program, ACOA contributes to the economic prosperity of both communities in general and French minority communities and Francophone entrepreneurs.",0
67,18,"The New Brunswick Economic Board and the Community Business Development Corporations are the two primary organizations supporting Francophone entrepreneurship in New Brunswick. The New Brunswick Economic Board focuses mainly on offering economic workshops and promoting networking between businesses to stimulate Francophone entrepreneurship. They created RD谷E-New Brunswick to support this objective. On the other hand, the Community Business Development Corporations provide assistance and support for business strategies and projects by producing studies, contributing to the creation of new businesses, and offering counsel and assistance for entrepreneurial development, training, and technical assistance. Although they don't exclusively provide services to Francophone entrepreneurs, they establish partnerships with other organizations addressing Francophones' development and entrepreneurship projects, such as RD谷E-New Brunswick and the New Brunswick Economic Board.",0
67,19,"In Nova Scotia, three entities focus on Francophone economic development: the Economic Development Council, RD谷E-Nova Scotia, and the Business and Entrepreneurship Support Center. The Economic Development Council oversees the other two organizations, having founded RD谷E-Nova Scotia and advocating for the financial stability and growth of the Acadian and Francophone population in Nova Scotia. Its purpose is to provide targeted regions with economic advancement by promoting and supporting Francophone enterprises. The Economic Development Council receives direct funding from ACOA and serves as a liaison between RD谷E and ACOA. Furthermore, RD谷E-Nova Scotia aims to promote economic development and equip individuals with tools for diversification and economic expansion. Finally, the Business and Entrepreneurship Support Center provides guidance to entrepreneurs and has joined forces with St. Anne University to establish a business support center.",0
67,20,"After creating a theoretical framework to identify key areas for regional economic development, we examined the organizations and initiatives that support Canadian Francophone minority communities. Our framework emphasized the need for high-road strategies, which can be adopted through initiatives such as building clusters, developing social capital, coordinating economic activities, promoting regional governance, and integrating social economy. Our research focused on RD谷E, an organization that caters to the unique economic development requirements of Francophone minority communities in Canada.",0
67,21,"The following are the main points of this article. RD谷E is aimed at developing social capital and networks among Francophones in different minority communities. The Canadian government's efforts to ensure minority communities' prosperity while preserving their cultures and language of choice are commendable. However, this study suggests that RD谷E is more focused on its underlying political functions than its intended economic goals. RD谷E promotes Canadian unity by paying attention to its Francophone minority communities, but it's uncertain whether it understands their needs regarding economic disadvantage and the appropriate response measures. Moreover, RD谷E's activities are not adapted to regional differences and dynamics, indicating inadequate preparation.",0
67,22,"We question why the four orientations need to cater specifically to the needs of the Francophone population. If any economic disadvantage faced by the Francophone population is linked to language, the government should intervene to ensure that choosing to live or conduct business in French does not hinder development. If there is no clear reason why Francophones require specific initiatives, then actions deployed for one language group should be similar to those for others. The RD谷E tourism orientation can be justified if it addresses any deficit where Francophones are underrepresented in the industry due to communication issues based on client demographics. In conclusion, the government should guarantee that being Francophone does not result in economic disadvantage, and Francophones have equal access to services, information, support, and economic opportunities.",0
67,23,"""The way in which RD谷E has integrated existing structures varies significantly by territory, as shown by our study. Some territories, such as WEDC, have adopted a top-down approach with standardized programs, while ACOA has opted for a more bottom-up approach that allows for greater flexibility. ACOA's structure aligns more closely with RD谷E's original mandate and avoids interference with provincial RD谷E and Francophone organizations. In Atlantic Canada, a complex network has formed between ACOA, Francophone associations, and economic development organizations, which allows for greater freedom but also increases the risk of overlaps. FedNor, on the other hand, focuses exclusively on rural and northern Ontario.""",0
68,1,"Various international evaluations of individual happiness demonstrate a significant connection between a nation's political institutions and the average level of contentment. This paper analyzes a set of industrialized market economies to see if the same correlation can be found with economic institutions. After controlling for other influential factors on happiness, no noticeable relationship between the type of economic system and happiness is observed. Possible explanations for the disparity between happiness and economic and political systems are considered.",0
68,2,"The impact of demographic variables and economic and political performance variables on happiness or subjective well-being has been studied extensively. However, the influence of political and economic systems and their institutions on SWB has been neglected until recently. Frey and his colleagues discovered that SWB varies according to the degree of direct democracy in Swiss cantons, while Helliwell found that citizens are happier in nations with a constitution establishing presidential systems and some form of proportional voting.",0
68,3,"There has been little scholarly analysis on the relationship between economic systems and happiness. Two vague arguments are often presented in the media: left-wing commentators claim welfare states like the Nordic nations promote greater happiness, whereas right-wing commentators argue laissez-faire capitalism leads to the greatest potential and happiness. Some suggest that people view economic systems instrumentally and are more concerned with their performance than the system itself. However, the economic performance of capitalist systems studied in this note is similar, suggesting no significant difference in happiness among countries with different systems.",0
68,4,"The three main motivations of this study are to investigate whether the correlation between political system and happiness can also be applied to economic systems, in order to establish a general fact that can guide future theoretical economic analysis. Additionally, the study aims to identify which economic institutions are responsible for this relationship once it is established, and to experimentally test the two ideological conjectures discussed earlier in the article.",0
68,5,"The upcoming section addresses three methodological concerns, specifically the measurement of happiness, sample selection, and the definition of economic systems. After that, there is a survey of 53 potential determinants of happiness at a national level, which is reduced through principal component analysis to make it more manageable. The following section presents the outcomes of the regression analysis that aims to connect the economic system to the level of happiness. The second-to-last section addresses the objections to this type of analysis. Finally, the last section summarizes the results and delves further into why political systems have more of an impact on SWB than economic systems.",0
68,6,"Numerous surveys seeking public opinion utilize questions like the one below to assess SWB or happiness (I use both words interchangeably): Considering all factors, how content would you say you are, on a scale ranging from zero to ten? Although the query is occasionally phrased in terms of life satisfaction, the conclusions are essentially identical (Veenhoven, 2000, especially pages 268-273). The outcomes of these polls have been standardized and condensed in the World Database of Happiness.",0
68,7,"The tabulated answers regarding SWB raise several questions about their meaningfulness, including the honesty of respondents, comparability of scores across individuals and cultures, consistency of answers over time, and potential cultural biases. However, extensive research on happiness suggests that in industrial nations, the survey responses do reflect a significant reality independent of cultural variations, and can be compared meaningfully across different countries.",0
68,8,"After excluding four nations, we are left with 21 countries that are part of OECD and possess diverse economic systems. Despite the differences, all these nations are democratic and share many political traits. Furthermore, they have almost similar developmental status. This similarity in cultural and political aspects ensures that any variations in their happiness level are not caused by these factors. Even though the sample size is small, utilizing regression analysis with a focus on statistical significance of estimated coefficient supports the validity of derived conclusions.",0
68,9,"An economic system is a collection of interdependent organizations and institutions that directly impact resource allocation. Unlike a political system that emphasizes political power, economic institutions prioritize property relations and the production and distribution of goods and services. Although some economic organizations have political features, such as government regulation, defining an economic system focuses on how regulations influence resource allocation rather than how regulators are chosen or respond to popular demand. As a result, both economic and political systems may focus on the same issues, but from different perspectives.",0
68,10,"Although economic systems are often categorized based on only one or two institutions, this essay takes a more comprehensive approach by considering 40 different institutions. These institutions are measured using quantitative indicators that represent various aspects of the market for goods and services, the labor market, the production and business sector, the government sector, and the financial sector. Examples of these indicators include product market regulation, barriers to starting new businesses, coverage of collective bargaining agreements, protection of jobs, concentration of corporate ownership, shareholder rights, government's share in total investment, share of employment in government owned enterprises, central bank independence, and bank concentration.",0
68,11,"The cluster analysis involved 40 institutional variables to identify groups of countries with similar institutional configurations. Using a two-dimensional example in Diagram 1, the institutions of government expenditures to GDP ratio and national vs. industrial wage bargaining were plotted on the axes A and B. Each country was represented by an x, forming institutional clusters enclosed by solid lines that define the economic systems Q, R, and S (Figure 1).",0
68,12,"The utilization of 40 institutional variables resulted in the identification of four clusters of economic systems, which are Anglo-Saxon, Nordic, Western European, and Southern European. This classification of the OECD nations' economic systems is not surprising as other economists have also arrived at a similar classification using alternative methods and standards.",0
68,13,"The average level of happiness is fairly consistent across different economic systems, with only the Nordic and Southern European nations showing significant differences (at a 0.05 level of significance). When we control for the possible influence of per capita GDP by adding its logarithm to the regression, none of the systems variable is found to have a significant association with happiness.",0
68,14,"The sample size is considerably smaller than the number of potential determinants, leading to disagreement among cross-national studies on the most important factors affecting happiness. There are 53 potential determinants proposed by others that merit examination, including achievement motivation, materialism, and subjective health ratings among others. These indicators reflect performance outcomes and cultural conditions and attitudes. However, none of these are included in the institutional variables that define the economic system. With a sample size of 21 nations, it is impossible to examine and statistically test all 53 determinants at the same time.",0
68,15,"To address the issues mentioned earlier, one can use principal component analysis to reduce the number of potential determinants. This approach involves identifying combinations of determinants that are closely correlated, thereby eliminating multicollinearity problems. Each determinant's effect is calculated and removed, and a new principal component is calculated from the remaining data. The result is a set of combined variables (principal components) that can be analyzed for their potential causal impact on happiness.",0
68,16,"The correlation of the first three principal components with the 53 determinants is presented in Table 2, with each determinant's relative importance indicated by the correlation coefficient. These components have eigenvalues exceeding 3.6 and collectively explain 54.1% of the variance. Although understanding a single component can be challenging, their significance lies in their ability to unify the many determinants that contribute to happiness.",0
68,17,"The outcomes of the regressions with only one principal component and the economic system are unremarkable. They exhibit a notable variation between the Nordic and Southern European economic systems for the third component, keeping the other factors constant. However, when all three components and economic systems are considered, none of the economic systems seem significantly distinct from the Nordic nations.",0
68,18,"The possible causal variables have various derived components which serve as the other explanatory variables. It is important to determine whether happiness is affected by individual economic systems, which can be measured through the calculated coefficient in the multiple regressions. The first three regressions analyze the relationship between happiness and each of the principal components and dummy variables that represent different economic systems. The fourth and final regressions consider all the principal components and economic systems, or only the principal components and economic systems combined.",0
68,19,"Based on the previous discussions on regressions, it appears that the economic system has no notable influence on the SWB of the population. Despite certain beliefs, the happiness of the individuals in the Nordic's mild economic system demonstrates no significant difference from those residing in the fierce Anglo-Saxon economic system, with all other factors considered. Nevertheless, there may be two potential arguments against this finding.",0
68,20,"By examining the correlation between the four individual economic systems and the three calculated components of the determinants of happiness, it can be determined whether there are significant relationships. Out of the 12 regressions, eight show no significant relationships. The Nordic and Southern European economic systems are significantly positively and negatively related to the first principal component, respectively. Similarly, the Anglo-Saxon and Nordic economic systems are, respectively, significantly positively and negatively related to the second principal component. These results suggest that in these cases, multicollinearity between the economic system and the principal component might have some impact on the results in Table 3, which affects the relationship between happiness with the economic system and component variables in one third of the cases. However, this impact appears to be minor.",0
68,21,"The potential counterargument to the assertion that the economic system has no impact on happiness pertains to the factors that shape the various economic systems. In a previous study (Pryor, 2007), I provided evidence that people in countries with comparable economic systems hold similar economic values and beliefs, which differ to some degree from those in other countries with equivalent levels of economic development but different economic systems. If these underlying economic beliefs and values that govern the economic systems are closely associated with the economic values that drive the three primary factors influencing happiness, then multicollinearity could be the reason for the lack of significant t-scores for the economic systems.",0
68,22,"The impact of the political system on people's lives is more immediate and visible than that of the economic system, which is comparatively more abstract. A referendum, for example, is a direct aspect of the political system that people are well-aware of. The nature of the political system, which deals with decision-making, makes it easier for the population to comprehend. On the other hand, the economic system comprises diverse and apparently disparate institutions, so the whole system remains less discernible, and individuals participating in it may not be acutely aware of their involvement in an economic system.",0
68,23,"People may feel they have little impact on changing the economic system compared to the political system, where voting and participating in activities can pressure the government for reform. Change in the economic system is rarely linked to individuals and is often deemed impossible except during revolutionary circumstances or economic crises. Thus, expectations of possible change play a significant role in happiness, and when these expectations are habitually low, people simply adapt to the unalterable economic system. This aligns with the findings in the happiness literature that individuals who have experienced major accidents eventually adapt to their circumstances and have similar levels of happiness as before.",0
69,1,"Drawing upon the current literature, this article explores the correlation between economic transition and corruption, highlighting how economic transition is a key contributor to the proliferation of corruption in China's transitional economy. The paper dissects economic transition into four segments, scrutinizing diverse avenues through which corruption arises. Utilizing statistical analysis on 594 significant cases of corruption, it pinpoints sectors at the highest risk of corruption and reveals some concrete evidence substantiating the existence of these paths.",0
69,2,"Corruption has plagued human society for millennia and is present in almost every country, regardless of its level of development or antiquity. In China, corruption has grown rapidly alongside the country's transition from a centrally planned economy to a socialist market economy. This has not only hindered economic development but also undermined social stability. The underlying causes of corruption in transitional China and its relationship with economic transition must be examined.",0
69,3,"At present, the widely accepted theory for explaining the spread of corruption in a country is the 'modernization theory' by American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington. However, this theory has faced difficulties in explaining corruption in Eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union during the transition period. Although scholars have linked corruption in transitional China to economic transition, few have provided empirical results. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to provide empirical evidence and enhance Huntington's theory. The discussion could also raise awareness of institutional involvement in combating corruption in China.",0
69,4,"Samuel P. Huntington (1989) developed a theory which stated that modernization causes corruption, based on his observation of corruption in the United States in the nineteenth century and in the UK in the eighteenth century. According to his theory, the level of corruption is linked to rapid social and economic modernization. Huntington identified three ways in which modernization affects corruption: firstly, modernization leads to a change in societal values; secondly, it creates opportunities for wealth and power, which can incentivize corruption; and lastly, changes in the political system as a result of modernization can accelerate corruption.",0
69,5,"Huntington's theory is commonly cited as an explanation for fluctuations in corruption levels across countries. However, research by Larrain and Tavares in 2000 suggests that economic development is also a significant factor in reducing corruption. While Huntington's theory works well for many countries, it fails to account for the rise of corruption in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union during their economic downturns. Some scholars propose that a balanced social structure can help to control corruption, while others argue that increasing the wages of public officials or implementing stricter punishments for corruption may be effective solutions.",0
69,6,"In the early 1980s, scholars began focusing on corruption and economic transition in China. China had adopted a gradual transition strategy characterized by the dual-track system. Scholars like Hao and Johnston noted that this reform greatly increased corruption opportunities and incentives. Wu used rent-seeking theory to analyze the root causes of official profiteering, while Gong argued that corruption was inevitable in the reform era. Lu analyzed corruption in the transition period and attributed it to the administrative system reform. Other scholars like Girling, RoseAckerman, Kaufmann, Siegelbaum, Fisman, and Pei found impacts of institutional revolution in other countries' experiences, such as enormous opportunities for corruption during democratization, privatization, and decentralization.",0
69,7,"Economic transition, as used in this paper, pertains to the shift from a centrally planned economy to a market economy. China underwent economic reform before undergoing economic transition starting in 1978. The reform focused on improving the existing centrally planned economy, while the transition introduced a new economic system to replace the old one. Although economic reform and economic transition are distinct concepts, they are collectively referred to as economic transition for convenience in this paper.",0
69,8,"China's economic transition is divided into four areas - economic liberalization, decentralization, privatization, and economic globalization, with each area corresponding to one of the five characters of the centrally planned economy system. Economic liberalization involves reducing the government's interference in economic activities and the rise of market economy's percentage in the economy. Decentralization of power refers to the central government empowering local governments and state-owned enterprises, including administrative and fiscal decentralization. Privatization highlights the increase of private enterprises in the economy, and economic globalization encompasses the growing international economic interplay, including FDI, international trade, and personnel exchange. These four areas constitute the main contents of China's economic transition since 1978, and although not implemented simultaneously, they were interconnected.",0
69,9,"Economic liberalization has the potential to foster corruption in two manners. Firstly, during the dual-pricing reform, certain public officials abused their authority for rent-seeking purposes. They transferred limited resources from the centrally planned economy to the market, resulting in significant and immediate profits. Secondly, some officials controlled market entry and demanded bribes during administrative approval processes. They frequently collaborated with emerging economy participants (primarily private enterprises) to safeguard their illicit actions.",0
69,10,"Privatization has the potential to encourage corruption through two methods. Firstly, a few businessmen may have intentionally undervalued state-owned properties by offering bribes, and consequently purchased them at a low price. Next, private enterprises that prospered during the period of economic transition may have lacked political support and therefore, attempted to secure protection by bribing officials. This resulted in an increased demand for corruption.",0
69,11,"Corruption is a sensitive issue and often concealed, making it hard to determine the extent of the problem. To understand corruption, researchers typically analyze known cases and investigate how they were carried out. However, simply looking at the number of cases annually does not give a comprehensive view, since the circumstances leading to each case may be vastly different. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying corruption, researchers must delve into the details of each case and examine statistical patterns. Using such an approach, this paper examines corruption in transitional China by applying the corruption case statistical analysis method proposed by Guo in 2008.",0
69,12,"Due to the delicate nature of corruption, no nation would disclose all data related to its corruption cases to the public, and China is not an exception. As a result, a trustworthy, exhaustive, or representative statistical analysis of all corruption cases uncovered and penalized during China's reform period remains impossible at present. However, we can resort to a viable alternative, which is to utilize corruption cases that have been published by authorized documents, publications, and media reports as research subjects and conduct statistical analysis.'",0
69,13,"Both Database A and Database B have their own shortcomings. While Database A provides a scientific sample of corruption cases involving senior officials discovered and punished from 1978, it has limited samples and is susceptible to political influences. On the other hand, Database B does not cover all cases discovered and punished during China's transition period involving middle level officials and is not selected randomly. However, it has a higher number of samples which helps in analyzing the distribution of corruption-prone areas more convincingly. By comparing these two databases, we can identify the differences in corruption patterns between officials at different levels.",0
69,14,"After analyzing the two databases, we examined the public officials' corrupt activities based on the public interests they concerned. Our analysis led us to conclude that corruption was caused by administrative approval, personnel management, administrative meddling, government procurement, and conflicts of interests. We further categorized the cases in the databases into subtypes according to their intention, resulting in the calculation of the number of corruption cases involving public officials in Table 2 for both Database A and B.",0
69,15,"According to Table 2, corruption cases involving public officials commonly occur in the areas of loan distribution and guarantee, personnel promotion, and contracting out construction projects, which is consistent with the findings of China's anti-corruption authorities. Administrative examination and approval and conflict of interests are also associated with economic activities resulting from China's economic transition. However, the former involves public servants seeking rent through abuse of power without direct participation in economic activities, while the latter involves public servants personally running businesses or supporting their family members. Corruption in administrative interference is a remnant of the planned economy system and has become even more prevalent due to China's decentralization of power.",0
69,16,"This article presents empirical proof regarding the correlation between the spread of corruption and China's economic transition. It outlines various means by which economic transition creates opportunities for corrupt practices, identifies areas at risk, and pinpoints institutional factors that contribute to corruption.
