"Neurogenesis is a process that is strictly regulated in order to create and maintain the complex architecture of the central nervous system. This phenomenon is a cellular plasticity mechanism in the adult brain, whereby new neurons are generated from neural stem cells. Neurogenesis involves various events, such as proliferation, restricting precursor cells to neuronal lineages, cell cycle arrest, migration, integration, and maturation, ultimately leading to functionally active neurons. The expression of doublecortin (DCX) is associated with the identification of neuronal precursors and newly generated neurons. DCX expression is mainly detected in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the subventricular zone/rostral migration stream/olfactory bulb axis. Scientists have established methods that use transgenic mice to study neurogenesis through the activation of reporter genes using the DCX promoter.","Neurogenesis is a carefully regulated process that both creates and sustains the complex cytoarchitecture of the central nervous system. Neurogenesis also plays a crucial role in the adult brain's cellular plasticity by continuously generating new neurons from resident neural stem cells. This process unfolds in several orderly stages: proliferation, lineage restriction, cell cycle cessation, migration, integration, differentiation, and functional and morphological maturation. At the end of this process, the newly formed neurons are fully integrated and active. Scientists use the expression of doublecortin (DCX) to identify these newly generated neurons and neuronal precursors. DCX expression is detected primarily in the adult dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the subventricular zone/rostral migration stream/olfactory bulb axis. Previously, the generation of transgenic mice equipped with reporter genes driven by the DCX promoter has enabled the monitoring of neurogenesis in these mice, both in vitro and in vivo.","Neurogenesis is a highly controlled process that maintains the complex cytoarchitecture of the central nervous system. In addition, neurogenesis is a form of neural plasticity in the adult brain as it continuously produces new neurons from the resident neural stem cells. The process involves several sequential events, such as proliferation, neuronal lineage restriction, cell cycle arrest, migration to target area, differentiation, and final maturation that leads to functional and morphological changes. At the end of the process, the newly generated cells become active and integrated neurons. The expression of doublecortin (DCX) has been identified as a marker for newly generated neurons and neuronal precursors. DCX expression is detected in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone/rostral migration stream/olfactory bulb axis. Researchers have created transgenic mice equipped with the DCX promoter to monitor neurogenesis both in vitro and in vivo through the activation of reporter genes."
"It is crucial to comprehend neurogenesis at both molecular and cellular levels to explore the potential of using it in therapeutic approaches for pathological neuronal losses. The role of abnormal neurogenesis in neuropsychiatric pathogenesis has been suggested by emerging evidence. Thus, various models, including transgenic models, have been developed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying neurogenesis in vivo. For instance, models with cell-type specific promoters such as nestin, GLAST, PLP, or DCX are used to investigate neural stem cells, radial glia, oligodendroglial precursors, and neuronal precursors, respectively.These models have been useful in the past, but they are not ideal for long-term studies such as fate mapping or assessing the long-term functional integration of newly generated neurons. The limitation is increased by the transient (mostly less than 1 month in rodents' DG and OB) expression of the DCX reporter in areas such as the SVZ/OB axis and the dentate gyrus, where DCX expression is detected only in newly formed neurons. As a result, these reporter mice are not suitable for carrying out fate mapping studies.","A comprehensive understanding of neurogenesis at both molecular and cellular levels is essential in developing therapeutic techniques to replace pathological neuronal losses. Emerging evidence indicates that abnormal neurogenesis may contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of neurogenesis in vivo, various models have been developed over the years, such as transgenic models utilizing cell-type specific promoters including nestin, GLAST, PLP, or DCX, which have been invaluable in the investigation of neural stem cells, radial glia, oligodendroglial precursors, and neuronal precursors. However, these models are not conducive to long-term studies such as fate mapping, or the long-term functional integration of newly generated neurons. In the dentate gyrus and the SVZ/OB axis, for example, DCX expression is only transient (mostly less than 1 month in rodents), rendering the DCX reporter mice unsuitable for fate mapping studies.","A better understanding of neurogenesis, at both molecular and cellular levels, is required to develop therapeutic strategies for replacing pathological neuronal losses. There is mounting evidence that abnormal neurogenesis may contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. Consequently, various models have been developed over the years, including transgenic models that rely on cell-type-specific promoters such as nestin, GLAST, PLP, or DCX. These models are used to explore the biology of neural stem cells, radial glia, oligodendroglial precursors, and neuronal precursors, respectively. Nonetheless, long-term studies, such as fate tracing, and investigations into the integration of newly generated neurons, are not feasible with these reporter mice. In the dentate gyrus and the SVZ/OB axis, DCX expression is transient, lasting mostly less than 1 month in rodents. As a result, DCX reporter mice are not an ideal option for fate mapping studies."
"To address the lack of a suitable tool for analyzing the fate of neuronal precursors, we developed transgenic mice that harbored the tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase gene under the regulation of the DCX promoter. Our research reveals that this advanced transgenic tool provides the opportunity for the creation of clear and regular labels for newly generated neurons and their fate can be tracked for an extended period. Additionally, it is an effective means for the regulation of gene expression within a critical time frame for neural differentiation and understanding the functional implications of such regulation.","In order to solve the issue of lacking a suitable tool that aids in the analysis of neuronal precursor fate, we developed transgenic mice which possess the tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase gene controlled by the DCX promoter. Our studies show that this novel transgenic tool allows for a time-resolved and long-term analysis of the fate of newly generated neurons. Additionally, it offers a means of regulating the expression of genes within an important time frame during neuronal maturation, enabling the exploration of the functional implications of such regulation.","To address the absence of an appropriate means of analyzing the fate of neuronal precursors, we generated transgenic mice containing the tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 recombinase gene, which is regulated by the DCX promoter.

Furthermore, it permits the regulation of gene expression within a crucial developmental stage of neurons, enabling researchers to investigate the functional consequences of such regulation."
"The CreERT2 cDNA was incorporated into the phuDCX-3509-DsRed2 cassette by subcloning a 2380-bp Sal I-Not I fragment of pCAG-CreERT2bpA-SS1 vector, which contains the CreERT2 cDNA, into the BamH I and Not I site.

In the SVZ and dentate gyrus, adult neurogenic regions, both DCX-CreERT2 transgenic lines exhibited the anticipated TAM-induced b-gal expression (Additional file 1). No b-gal activity was observed in the progeny derived from founder 2 following vehicle injection. However, in mice from founder 1, numerous b-gal positive profiles were identified after vehicle injection, indicating unspecific recombination events (data not shown). Therefore, only the transgenic DCXCreERT2 founder 2 line was expanded and used for subsequent analysis.","In order to evaluate Cre-recombinase activity, F1 generation of two founder-derived lines were mated with Rosa26 lacZ reporter mice to activate a lacZ expression after recombination [23]. Adult neurogenic regions including the SVZ and dentate gyrus were observed for b-gal activity in two-month-old DCX-CreERT2:Rosa26 lacZ mice following a tamoxifen (TAM) or vehicle injection. As expected, both DCX-CreERT2 transgenic lines showed TAM-induced b-gal expression in these regions (Additional file 1). Progeny of founder 2 did not display any b-gal activity after vehicle injections. However, founder 1 mice had multiple b-gal positive profiles detected following vehicle injection, indicating random recombination events (data not shown). Consequently, only the transgenic DCXCreERT2 founder 2 line was expanded and used for further examination."
"To validate that CreERT2 expression along with endogenous DCX expression aligns in the DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice, the respective expression patterns were analyzed. At a cellular level, almost all DCX+ cells in the developing CNS showed CreERT2 expression (E15.5). Moreover, one day post-injection of TAM, CreERT2 was observed to have moved to the nucleus (Figure 1a). Correspondingly, in the adult brain, CreERT2 expression was restricted to the nucleus of DCX+ cells one day after TAM injection (Figure 1b). The administration of TAM induced nuclear localization, which is necessary for CreERT2 activity [24].","To validate that CreERT2 expression coincides with endogenous DCX expression in DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice, the expression patterns were compared. At the cellular level, CreERT2 was detected in nearly all DCX+ cells of the developing CNS (E15.5). Furthermore, one day after TAM injection, CreERT2 was observed to have translocated to the nucleus (Figure 1a). Correspondingly, in the adult brain, CreERT2 expression was highly specific to the nucleus of DCX+ cells one day after TAM injection (Figure 1b). Nuclear localization of CreERT2 is induced by TAM administration and is essential for CreERT2 activity [24].","In order to confirm that CreERT2 expression matches the endogenous DCX expression in DCX-CreERT2 transgenic mice, the respective expression patterns were analyzed. At the cellular level, CreERT2 was detected in almost all DCX+ cells of the developing CNS (E15.5). Additionally, one day following the administration of TAM, CreERT2 was found to be translocated to the nucleus (Figure 1a). Similarly, in the adult brain, CreERT2 expression was exclusively located in the nucleus of DCX+ cells one day following TAM injection (Figure 1b). Nuclear localization is induced by TAM administration and is a necessary prerequisite for CreERT2 activity [24]."
"To assess the time window during which CreERT2 performs its function in the nucleus following a TAM injection, DCX-CreERT2 adult mice were perfused at different time points post-injection, and the CreERT2 sub-cellular localization was analyzed. The nuclear localization of CreERT2 was substantially reduced after seven days of TAM injection compared to the first day. Even at this point, CreERT2 expression was co-localized with DCX, but its distribution switched back to being largely cytoplasmic (as shown in Figure 1c). In addition, two weeks after the TAM injection, CreERT2 was only found in the cytoplasm (as demonstrated in Figures 1d and 1e). Overall, our results suggest that CreERT2's nuclear localization recedes quickly after the final TAM administration, implying that CreERT2 activity is transient and mostly ceases after seven days.","In order to determine the duration during which CreERT2 operates in the nucleus subsequent to the TAM injection, DCX-CreERT2 adult mice were perfused at various time points after the injection, and the CreERT2 sub-cellular localization was assessed. The CreERT2 nuclear localization was significantly reduced seven days post-TAM injection in comparison to the first day. At this point, CreERT2 expression was still co-localized with DCX, albeit its distribution returned to mostly cytoplasmic (illustrated in Figure 1c). Moreover, after two weeks of TAM injection, CreERT2 was exclusively situated in the cytoplasm (as demonstrated in Figures 1d and 1e). Taken together, our findings suggest that CreERT2 nuclear localization rapidly fades away following the final TAM administration, indicating that CreERT2 activity is transient and essentially stops after seven days.","To determine the time frame during which CreERT2 functions in the nucleus after the TAM injection, DCX-CreERT2 adult mice were perfused at different time points post-injection, and the sub-cellular localization of CreERT2 was evaluated. The localization of CreERT2 in the nucleus was significantly reduced after seven days of TAM injection compared to the first day. At this time point, CreERT2 expression was still co-localized with DCX, but its distribution reverted to being predominantly cytoplasmic (as shown in Figure 1c). Furthermore, after two weeks of TAM injection, CreERT2 was exclusively distributed in the cytoplasm (as demonstrated in Figures 1d and 1e). Overall, our results suggest that the nuclear localization of CreERT2 quickly diminishes following the last TAM administration, indicating that the activity of CreERT2 is transient and virtually ceases after seven days."
"After validating the appropriate co-localization of CreERT2 with DCX+ cells, we assessed the specificity and activity of recombination. In order to achieve this, we crossed DCX-CreERT2 mice with Rosa26 lacZ or CAG-CATEGFP reporter mice, which allowed us to monitor activation of the appropriate reporter gene expression, post-successful excision of the loxP-flanked cassette. The outcome of DCX-expressing cells' destiny could then be monitored based on the expression of the reporter gene at different times following recombination.","Once we had confirmed that CreERT2 was co-localizing correctly with DCX+ cells, we conducted an analysis of the specificity and activity of recombination. To do this, we bred DCX-CreERT2 mice with Rosa26 lacZ or CAG-CATEGFP reporter mice, which enabled us to monitor the activation of the relevant reporter gene expression in the event of successful excision of the loxP-flanked cassette. We could then examine the fate of DCX-expressing cells by analyzing reporter gene expression at various time points subsequent to recombination.","After confirming that CreERT2 was co-localized correctly with DCX+ cells, our next step was to investigate the specificity and activity of recombination. To achieve this, we bred DCX-CreERT2 mice with either Rosa26 lacZ or CAG-CATEGFP reporter mice, which allowed us to monitor the activation of the corresponding reporter gene expression following successful excision of the loxP-flanked cassette. By analyzing reporter gene expression at multiple time points after recombination, we could track the fate of DCX-expressing cells."
"After administering TAM injection on E14.5,to determine CreERT2 activity, X-gal staining revealed that b-gal expression was confined to the development of CNS and DRGs. The same distribution pattern was observed in endogenous DCX expression at this stage. On E17.5, a single TAM-injection resulted in EGFP reporter expression in the majority of brain parenchyma regions, such as dentate gyrus, striatum, cortex, thalamus, Ammon’s horn (CA1), etc., as per the pattern of DCX expression.","The CreERT2 activity during embryonic stages was examined by administering a TAM injection on E14.5. The results of X-gal staining exhibited that b-gal expression was limited to the development of CNS and DRGs. The distribution pattern corresponds to the endogenous DCX expression at this stage, as shown in Figure 2a. After giving a single TAM-injection on E17.5, CreERT2 was activated, leading to EGFP reporter expression distribution throughout different brain parenchymal regions, including dentate gyrus, striatum, cortex, thalamus, Ammon’s horn (CA1), etc. This distribution was also similar to the pattern of DCX expression.","To determine the activity of CreERT2 during embryonic stages, a single TAM injection was administered on E14.5. Results of X-gal staining showed that b-gal expression was confined to the development of CNS and DRGs. The distribution pattern of b-gal expression corresponded to the endogenous expression of DCX at this stage, as shown in Figure 2a. Activation of CreERT2 on E17.5 by a single TAM injection resulted in the widespread distribution of EGFP reporter expression in various brain parenchymal regions, such as dentate gyrus, striatum, cortex, thalamus, Ammon’s horn (CA1), etc., following the pattern of DCX expression. These findings are illustrated in Figure 2d to 2k and Additional file 2."
"After analyzing the data, it was found that virtually every cell expressing EGFP also expressed NeuN, indicating that these cells had progressed into mature neurons (as seen in Figure 2d to 2g). Moreover, the study found that EGFP expression was not detected in DCX-positive cells found in the SVZ (as shown in Figure 2f and 2g), nor in the rostral migrating stream or subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, except for a few EGFP+ cells found in or near the ependymal layer of the lateral ventricles (indicated by arrows in Figure 2f). However, these EGFP+ cells did not have co-expression with NeuN or DCX, and therefore their identity is yet to be determined.","Upon examination, it was discovered that nearly all cells that displayed EGFP also demonstrated NeuN expression, signifying neuronal maturity (depicted in Figure 2d to 2g). In contrast, EGFP expression was not detected among DCX-positive cells located in the SVZ (refer to Figure 2f and 2g), nor in the RMS (data not shown), or the SGZ of the dentate gyrus (as demonstrated in Figure 2d and 2e) with only a small number of EGFP+ cells located within or in close proximity to the ependymal layer of the lateral ventricles appearing (arrows in Figure 2f). Notably, these cells did not show co-expression with either NeuN or DCX, and their classification remains unknown.","The data revealed that almost all EGFP+ cells also exhibited NeuN expression, indicating that these cells had matured into neurons (as depicted in Figure 2d to 2g).

Some EGFP+ cells were present within or close to the ependymal layer of the lateral ventricles (as illustrated by arrows in Figure 2f); however, these EGFP+ cells did not exhibit co-expression with NeuN or DCX, and their classification remains obscure."
"Within the context of exploring the production of neurons in the adult CNS, adult mice were administered TAM injections over five consecutive days before being analyzed four weeks following their last injection. At this point, it was observed that EGFP+ cells that came from SVZ reached the OB, and were mainly distributed in the GrO layer with fewer cells in the pGl layer. Despite expression of NeuN by the EGFP+ cells in the OB, indicating maturity, there was no evidence of co-expression of DCX. The rostral RMS had scattered EGFP+ cells expressing DCX, however, only few EGFP+ cells were found in the SVZ. Likewise, in the dentate gyrus, EGFP+ cells expressed NeuN and not DCX. (Figure 2h–k).","To investigate the production of neurons in the adult CNS, adult mice were injected with TAM for five consecutive days before being analyzed four weeks after the final injection. The results showed that EGFP+ cells generated in the SVZ traveled to the OB and were primarily located in the GrO cell layer, with fewer cells in the pGl layer. The EGFP+ cells located in the OB showed NeuN expression, indicating neuronal maturity, but no expression of DCX was found. In contrast, the rostral RMS had few EGFP+ cells scattered with the expression of DCX. The SVZ had only a small number of EGFP+ cells. Similar to the findings in the OB, EGFP+ cells in the dentate gyrus expressed NeuN and lacked expression of DCX. (Figure 2h–k).","The study aimed to investigate the limited production of neurons in the adult CNS by administering TAM injections to adult mice for five consecutive days and analyzing them four weeks after the last injection. The results showed that EGFP+ cells generated in the SVZ reached the OB and were mainly located in the GrO cell layer, with fewer cells found in the pGl layer. The EGFP+ cells present in the OB expressed NeuN, a marker of neuronal maturity, but not DCX. However, a few scattered EGFP+ cells in the rostral RMS retained expression of DCX, while only rare EGFP+ cells were found in the SVZ. In the dentate gyrus, EGFP+ cells expressed NeuN and was devoid of DCX, similar to the cells detected in the OB. (Figure 2h–k)."
"The efficiency and specificity of recombination events in DCX-expressing cells were assessed in the adult SVZ and SGZ. Efficiency was determined by the proportion of all DCX+ cells that expressed EGFP, while specificity was determined by the percentage of all EGFP+ cells that expressed DCX. To enhance EGFP signals, an anti-EGFP antibody was used in subsequent experiments since initial EGFP levels within cells were relatively low. Following the last TAM injection, about 94% of DCX+ cells expressed EGFP in the SVZ (Figure 3c and 3o). In the SGZ of the dentate gyrus, EGFP was present in approximately 77% of DCX-expressing cells (Figure 3d and 3o). Moreover, co-expression of DCX was observed in about 96% of EGFP+ cells in SVZ and 90% in SGZ (Figure 3p), indicating highly efficient and specific CreERT2 activity.","The effectiveness and specificity of the recombination event in DCX-expressing cells were assessed in the adult SVZ and SGZ. To calculate efficiency, the proportion of DCX+ cells expressing EGFP was determined, while specificity was based on the percentage of EGFP+ cells expressing DCX. Since the level of EGFP within the cells was very low initially, all subsequent experiments used an anti-EGFP antibody to amplify the signals. Following the last TAM injection, approximately 94% of DCX+ cells in the SVZ expressed EGFP (Figure 3c and 3o), while in the SGZ of the dentate gyrus, EGFP was present in approximately 77% of DCX-expressing cells (Figure 3d and 3o). Moreover, approximately 96% of EGFP+ cells in the SVZ and 90% in the SGZ (Figure 3p) co-expressed DCX, demonstrating the highly efficient and specific activity of CreERT2.","In the adult SVZ and SGZ, the efficiency and specificity of recombination events in DCX-expressing cells were measured. Efficiency was determined by calculating the percentage of all DCX+ cells expressing EGFP, while specificity referred to the percentage of all EGFP+ cells expressing DCX. Since the levels of EGFP accumulating within cells were too low initially, an anti-EGFP antibody was used to amplify signals for all subsequent experiments. Two days after the last TAM injection, about 94% of DCX+ cells in the SVZ (Figure 3c and 3o) and approximately 77% in the SGZ of the dentate gyrus expressed EGFP (Figure 3d and 3o). Additionally, approximately 96% of EGFP+ cells in the SVZ and 90% in the SGZ (Figure 3p) co-expressed DCX, indicating the excellent efficiency and specificity of CreERT2 activity."
"To further investigate the kinetics of DCX+ cells' movement from their site of origin to their target structures, the researchers analyzed the distribution of cells that expressed EGFP after recombination at different time points. They sacrificed adult mice on day 8, day 15, and day 29 after the last TAM injection and studied the co-localization of EGFP expression with DCX and NeuN within the SVZ-RMS-OB axis and dentate gyrus.","The distribution of EGFP-expressing cells was analyzed over time to further understand the movement of DCX+ cells from their birthplace to their target structures. The study focused on analyzing the kinetics of these cells and their co-localization with NeuN and DCX within the dentate gyrus and SVZ-RMS-OB axis. For this purpose, adult mice were sacrificed on the eighth, fifteenth, and twenty-ninth day following the last injection of TAM.","In order to gain a better understanding about the process of cells expressing DCX+ leaving their site of birth and arriving at their target structures, the researchers examined the distribution of cells that expressed EGFP following recombination over a period of time. They analyzed the co-localization of DCX and NeuN with EGFP expression in the SVZ-RMS-OB axis and the dentate gyrus on the eighth, fifteenth, and twenty-ninth day after the final TAM injection in adult mice."
"The percentage of EGFP-expressing cells that were DCX-positive in the SGZ decreased from 100% at day 2 to 25% at day 15. Similarly, the percentage of cells that were positive for both EGFP and DCX in the SVZ decreased from 26.7% at day 8 to 12.5% at day 15. By day 29, only a few EGFP-labeled cells expressing DCX were present in the SVZ, and no co-localization between EGFP and DCX was detected in the SGZ. This suggests that the main wave of EGFP-labeled neuron migration left the SVZ within the first 15 days. (Figure 3)","After two days of the last TAM injection, there was a high percentage of EGFP-expressing cells that were also DCX-positive in the SGZ. However, this percentage decreased gradually to approximately 25% of all DCX+ cells by day 15, as shown in Figure 3. Co-localization between EGFP and DCX also decreased from 26.7% at day 8 to 12.5% at day 15 in the SVZ. At day 29, only a few EGFP+ cells expressing DCX were observed in the SVZ, while no co-localization was seen in the SGZ. These findings suggest that the primary migration of EGFP-labeled neurons began within the first 15 days from the SVZ.","The SGZ showed a substantially high percentage of EGFP-expressing DCX+ cells two days after the last TAM injection, which decreased to 41% at day 8 of the experiment, and further declined to around 25% of all DCX+ cells at day 15. Concomitantly, the frequency of co-localization in the SVZ decreased to 26.7% at day 8, and then further declined to 12.5% at day 15. As Figure 3 demonstrates, only isolated EGFP+ cells expressing DCX remained in the SVZ by day 29, whereas there was no co-localization detected in the SGZ at that point. In conclusion, the data indicates that the principal migration of EGFP-labeled neurons took place within the first 15 days, departing from the SVZ."
"The migration of EGFP+ cells from D2 to D15 along the RMS indicated that the cells maintained an immature neuronal morphology and only a few co-localization with NeuN was observed, which was demonstrated in Figure 4. As cells approached the GrO or pGl of the olfactory bulb over a four-week period, there was a general increase in NeuN expression within EGFP+ cells, as presented in Figure 2h and 2i, Figure 4 a, e and 4i. It was found that EGFP+ cells in the GrO region displayed low DCX expression, whereas EGFP+ cells located at the anterior end of the RMS still exhibited strong DCX expression (indicated by the arrow in Figure 2i), indicating that DCX expression decreases gradually as EGFP+ cells migrate into their target regions. Therefore, it was revealed that DCX expression was regionally regulated during the migration of cells towards the olfactory bulb. Similarly, EGFP-expressing cells were observed to be integrated into the inner granular layer of the dentate gyrus over time and gradually induced the expression of NeuN. The results of quantitative analysis indicate that more than 80% of EGFP+ cells in the dentate gyrus (as in Figure 4m) and virtually all EGFP+ cells found in the olfactory bulb expressed the mature neuronal marker NeuN, confirming their neurogenesis.","During their migration along the RMS from D2 to D15, EGFP+ cells were observed to have an immature neuronal morphology and only a few instances of co-localization with NeuN could be seen, as shown in Figure 4. As the cells reached the GrO or pGl of the olfactory bulb over the next four weeks, there was a general increase in NeuN expression within EGFP+ cells, as demonstrated in Figure 2h and 2i, Figure 4 a, e and 4i. Interestingly, EGFP+ cells in the GrO region exhibited only weak expression of DCX, while DCX expression was still strong in the cytoplasm of EGFP+ cells in the anterior end of the RMS, indicating that the expression of DCX gradually decreases as EGFP+ cells migrate towards their target regions (data not presented). Hence, it was revealed that the expression of DCX in cells migrating towards the olfactory bulb is regionally regulated. EGFP+ cells in the dentate gyrus were also observed to integrate into the inner granular layer over time, gradually inducing the expression of NeuN. Quantitative analysis showed that after 15 days of the last TAM administration, more than 80% of EGFP+ cells in the dentate gyrus (as shown in Figure 4m), and virtually all EGFP+ cells in the olfactory bulb expressed the mature neuronal marker NeuN, indicating their neurogenesis.","The migration of EGFP+ cells along the RMS from D2 to D15 exhibited an immature neuronal morphology, with only a few instances of co-localization with NeuN, as illustrated in Figure 4. Following this, as the cells reached the GrO or pGl of the olfactory bulb over the next four weeks, NeuN expression was broadly induced within the EGFP+ cells, as indicated in Figure 2h and 2i, Figure 4a, e and 4i. Conversely, in the GrO, only weak expression of DCX was observed in EGFP+ cells, whereas strong expression of DCX was observed in the cytoplasm of EGFP+ cells located at the anterior end of the RMS (indicated by the arrow in Figure 2i), signifying that the expression of DCX decreases gradually as EGFP+ cells migrate into their target regions. Consequently, it was unveiled that DCX expression in cells migrating to the olfactory bulb is regionally regulated. Similarly, EGFP-expressing cells in the dentate gyrus integrated into the inner granular layer over time and expressed NeuN gradually. According to quantitative analysis, more than 80% of EGFP+ cells detected in the dentate gyrus after 15 days of the last TAM administration (as demonstrated in Figure 4m), and almost all EGFP+ cells found in the olfactory bulb expressed the mature neuronal marker NeuN, verifying their neurogenesis."
"The neuronal phenotypes of EGFP-labeled neurons were further characterized through the use of immunohistology to examine the presence of neurotransmitter-specific markers and calcium-binding proteins on D29 (Figure 5). As demonstrated in earlier investigations (25, 26), EGFP-expressing cells within the OB were able to be detected as expressing GAD65, a commonly found marker in GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, throughout Figure 5, it was discovered that a subset of periglomerular EGFP+ cells exhibited a co-expression of TH, a marker specifically associated with dopaminergic neurons.","Immunohistology was utilized to further characterize the neuronal phenotypes of EGFP-labeled neurons, specifically examining the existence of neurotransmitter-specific markers and calcium-binding proteins at the D29 time point (Figure 5). Consistent with earlier studies (25, 26), GAD65 expression, a marker commonly found in GABAergic neurons, could be detected in EGFP-expressing cells located in the OB. Additionally, periglomerular EGFP+ cells were observed to exhibit a co-expression of TH, a marker specific to dopaminergic neurons (Figure 5).","In order to gain further insight into the neuronal phenotypes of EGFP-labeled neurons, immunohistology was conducted to explore the presence of neurotransmitter-specific markers and calcium-binding proteins on the 29th day (D29) (Figure 5). In agreement with earlier studies (25, 26), the expression of GAD65, found in GABAergic neurons, was present within EGFP-expressing cells located in the OB. Furthermore, a subset of periglomerular EGFP+ cells showed co-expression of TH, a marker specific to dopaminergic neurons (Figure 5), uncovering a unique population of EGFP-labeled neurons."
"VGLUT2 is a commonly used marker for glutamatergic terminations, and at D29, it was observed in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus and surrounded EGFP+ cells. This suggests that glutamatergic inputs were being received by EGFP-expressing cells (as shown in Figure 5). Furthermore, the expression of calcium-binding proteins, calbindin-D28K, calretinin and parvalbumin, was investigated in the EGFP-labeled granule neurons at this time point. Calbindin-D28K was detected in most EGFP+ cells of the dentate gyrus, while no parvalbumin expression and only weak calretinin expression could be observed in EGFP+ cells. Nevertheless, the presence of cells expressing high levels of parvalbumin or calretinin, specifically newly generated granule cells, could be found in the vicinity (as demonstrated by the arrow in Figure 5e).","At D29, EGFP-expressing cells in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus were surrounded by VGLUT2, a marker that is typically utilized to mark glutamatergic terminations. This implies that the EGFP+ cells received glutamatergic inputs (as displayed in Figure 5). Furthermore, at this time point, we examined the EGFP-labeled granule neurons for the presence of calcium-binding proteins, such as calbindin-D28K, calretinin and parvalbumin. Calbindin-D28K could be detected in most EGFP+ cells of the dentate gyrus, while no parvalbumin expression and only weak calretinin expression were evident in EGFP+ cells. However, cells expressing high levels of parvalbumin or calretinin, especially newly generated granule cells, were present in the vicinity (as indicated by the arrow in Figure 5e).","The granular layer of the dentate gyrus showed the presence of VGLUT2, which is a common marker for glutamatergic terminations, and this could be observed surrounding EGFP+ cells at D29.

Moreover, we examined the EGFP-labeled granule neurons to evaluate the expression of calcium-binding proteins, such as calbindin-D28K, calretinin and parvalbumin at this time point. The majority of EGFP+ cells of the dentate gyrus displayed expression of calbindin-D28K, which is typically produced by mature granule neurons. No parvalbumin expression and only weak calretinin expression could be detected in EGFP+ cells. However, cells expressing high levels of parvalbumin or calretinin, specifically newly generated granule cells, were noted in the vicinity (as pointed out by the arrow in Figure 5e)."
"DCX expression is observed in a diverse group of neuronal precursors and young neurons at different stages of maturation and proliferation. To label proliferative cells, BrdU was administered at various time points following recombination. At D2 (the earliest time point), a significant proportion of EGFP+ cells in the SVZ (51.1%) and a smaller proportion in the SGZ (7.7%) incorporated BrdU, indicating continued proliferation. The higher number of actively dividing cells in the SVZ may be attributed to the emigration of post-mitotic young neurons out of the SVZ, leaving immature cells behind. Moreover, while no further BrdU incorporation in EGFP+ cells was observed in SGZ at D15, a few co-labeling BrdU+/EGFP+ cells were seen in RMS, implying that some EGFP+ cells in the SVZ/RMS/OB axis could maintain proliferative capacity until at least D15. This underscores the limited temporal capacity of DCX+ cells.","The population of neuronal precursors and young neurons expressing DCX is relatively diverse, encompassing cells at various maturation stages and degrees of proliferation. BrdU was used to label proliferative cells at different time points after recombination. At D2, approximately 51.1% of EGFP+ cells in the SVZ and only 7.7% of EGFP+ cells in the SGZ incorporated BrdU, indicating that some cells were actively dividing. The higher number of mitotically active cells in the SVZ could be due to young post-mitotic neurons migrating out of the SVZ and leaving immature cells behind. Moreover, while no further BrdU incorporation in EGFP+ cells was observed in SGZ at D15, a few BrdU+/EGFP+ co-labeling cells were observed in RMS, which suggests that some EGFP+ cells in the SVZ/RMS/OB axis may retain proliferative capability until at least D15. Therefore, the proliferative capacity of DCX+ cells is likely limited temporally.","The expression of DCX is observed in a heterogeneous population of neuronal precursors and young neurons across various stages of maturation and proliferation. To label proliferative cells, BrdU was introduced at different time points following recombination. At D2, around 51.1% of EGFP+ cells in the SVZ and only 7.7% of EGFP+ cells in the SGZ incorporated BrdU, suggesting that some cells were still proliferating. The greater representation of mitotically active cells in the SVZ may be attributed to young post-mitotic neurons leaving the SVZ, leaving immature cells behind. Also, while no further BrdU incorporation in EGFP+ cells was detected in SGZ at D15, there were a few BrdU+/EGFP+ co-labeling cells found in RMS (although not shown), inferring that some EGFP+ cells in the SVZ/RMS/OB axis may maintain their ability to proliferate as late as D15. Thus, the proliferative capacity of DCX+ cells appears to be temporally limited."
"After administering TAM to adult mice with DCXCreERT2:CAG-CAT-EGFP, EGFP+ cells were observed outside of the previously identified neurogenic regions. Similar to previous reports in adult rodents, cats, and primates, isolated DCX-expressing cells were observed in the cerebral cortex. To confirm that expression of EGFP in these cells outside of the neurogenic regions was due to DCX activation, the expression pattern of DCX was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in the entire adult brain in relation to EGFP activation.","When TAM was administered to adult DCXCreERT2:CAG-CAT-EGFP mice, EGFP+ cells were detected beyond the known neurogenic regions. Previously, it had been reported that scattered DCX-expressing cells could be found in the adult cerebral cortex of rodents, cats, and primates. To confirm that the EGFP expression in cells outside of the neurogenic regions was indeed due to DCX expression, the expression pattern of DCX throughout the entire adult brain was examined using immunohistochemistry in relation to EGFP activation.","After the administration of TAM to adult mice with DCXCreERT2:CAG-CAT-EGFP, the presence of EGFP+ cells was confirmed in regions beyond the known neurogenic regions. Previous research highlighted the existence of dispersed DCX-expressing cells in the adult cerebral cortex of rodents, cats, and primates. To verify that the expression of EGFP in cells outside of the neurogenic regions was due to DCX expression, the DCX expression pattern in the brain was thoroughly examined using immunohistochemistry in relation to EGFP activation."
"There was a detection of low to moderate DCX expression found among cells dispersed across the cerebral cortex, and weak DCX expression was also visible near the corpus callosum, around the 3rd ventricle and hypothalamus, and in the MCL and GCL of cerebellum (though this data was not shown). After a four-week period following TAM injection, EGFP+ cells were found in those same regions, as shown in Figure 7. Notably, the level of reporter expression was markedly greater than that of endogenous DCX expression, as a strong promoter was used to regulate recombination. The EGFP+ cells discovered outside neurogenic regions were not proliferative, revealing a lack of BrdU labeling, and thus the true identity and destiny of these immature neurons must remain to be fully understood.","Throughout the cerebral cortex, there were scattered cells that displayed a mild to moderate level of DCX expression (`Figure 7`). Additionally, faint DCX expression could be observed in the corpus callosum, as well as around the 3rd ventricle and hypothalamus, the MCL and GCL of cerebellum, but this data was not revealed. Following TAM injection, EGFP+ cells were also found in these particular areas after four weeks (`Figure 7`). However, due to a powerful promoter being employed for recombination, the reporter expression levels were substantially greater than the endogenous DCX expression levels. This was important as it was discovered that the EGFP+ cells situated outside of the neurogenic regions were not proliferative, clearly illustrated by the absence of BrdU incorporation. Therefore, further study is required to identify the nature and future of these immature neurons.","Cells spread across the cerebral cortex displayed low to moderate levels of DCX expression and some weaker DCX expression was also seen in the corpus callosum, 3rd ventricle and hypothalamus, as well as in the MCL and GCL of cerebellum (`data not shown`). After a four-week period of TAM injection, EGFP+ cells were found in these regions (`Figure7`). However, the reporter expression levels were significantly higher when compared to the endogenous DCX expression levels because of the strong promoter being used upon recombination. It is vital to note that the EGFP+ cells located outside the neurogenic regions did not have any proliferative potential, as evidenced by the lack of BrdU incorporation. Therefore, the exact nature and fate of these immature neurons must be further examined."
"We have successfully demonstrated that the utilization of a DCX promoter-driven CreERT2 can efficiently and specifically target recombination in vivo in DCX-expressing cells, particularly in neuronal precursors and young neurons. Our approach surpasses previously generated DCX promoter-driven reporter lines by incorporating the 3’UTR region of the DCX mRNA, which contains post-transcriptional regulation elements of gene expression. Despite no significant differences in CreERT2 expression patterns under the experimental conditions utilized, this construction including the DCX 3'UTR could result in a more accurate CreERT2 expression pattern within the DCX-expressing cell population. Additional research will be required to fully understand its function.","We've demonstrated that recombination can be efficiently and specifically targeted in vivo in DCX-expressing cells through the utilization of CreERT2-mediated recombination. The use of a DCX promoter-driven CreERT2 construct is crucial in this approach, which accurately targets neuronal precursors and young neurons. Unlike previously generated DCX-promoter driven reporter lines, our construct also encodes the 3'UTR region of the DCX mRNA, which contains important post-transcriptional regulation elements of gene expression, and may lead to more accurate CreERT2 expression within the DCX-expressing cell population. While we did not see any significant differences in CreERT2 expression patterns compared to previous lines, further investigation will be necessary to fully understand the role and function of the DCX 3'UTR.","Our report showcases the efficiency and specificity of CreERT2-mediated recombination in vivo in DCX-expressing cells, such as neuronal precursors and young neurons, thanks to a DCX promoter-driven CreERT2 construct. This construct was designed to include the 3’UTR region of the DCX mRNA, which is known to contain post-transcriptional regulation elements of gene expression. While we did not observe any discernible differences in the expression patterns of the CreERT2 transgene under the experimental conditions used, the inclusion of the DCX 3’UTR could lead to a more accurate expression pattern of CreERT2 within the DCX-expressing cell population. Further research is required to understand the exact function and impact of the DCX 3'UTR."
"After administration of TAM, the CreERT2 protein was translocated to the nuclear region of DCX-expressing cells where it facilitated recombination, resulting in rapid activation of reporter expression. Both embryonic and adult CNS showed observable b-gal or EGFP expression one day after tamoxifen injection (Figure 2). Our experimental paradigms exhibited a high efficiency of recombination as demonstrated by 94% of DCX+ cells within the SVZ and 77% of DCX+ cells in the dentate gyrus expressing EGFP after undergoing five daily tamoxifen administrations. Moreover, specificity of recombination activity was confirmed by 96% of EGFP+ cells in SVZ and 90% in SGZ that co-expressed DCX (Figure 3). The study concluded that EGFP+ cells were solely involved in neural development and the absence of DCX expression in a minority of the EGFP+ cells was because of DCX expression downregulation that took place during the 5-day TAM injection period.","Following TAM administration, the CreERT2 protein translocated to the nuclear compartment of DCX-expressing cells, promoting recombination, and leading to a swift activation of reporter expression. One day after tamoxifen injection, b-gal or EGFP expression was noticeable in the embryonic and adult CNS (Figure 2), indicating that our experimental approaches had high recombination efficiency. Our findings showed that 94% of DCX+ cells in the SVZ and 77% of DCX+ cells in the dentate gyrus expressed EGFP after five daily tamoxifen administrations, while 96% of EGFP+ cells in SVZ and 90% in SGZ co-expressed DCX, demonstrating the high specificity of recombination activity (Figure 3). Remarkably, the sole neuronal fate of EGFP+ cells was identified, and it was found that the absence of DCX expression in a small fraction of the EGFP+ cells was associated with the maturation-mediated downregulation of DCX+ during the 5-day TAM injection period.","Once TAM was administered, the CreERT2 protein relocated to the nuclear compartment of DCX-expressing cells which allowed recombination to occur, leading to quick activation of reporter expression. Within a day of tamoxifen injection, b-gal or EGFP could be identified in both the embryonic and adult CNS (Figure 2), denoting that our experimental methods had considerable recombination efficiency. Our study showed that after five daily tamoxifen administrations, 94% of DCX+ cells in SVZ and 77% DCX+ cells in the dentate gyrus induced expression of EGFP, indicating a high efficiency of recombination as per our experimental paradigms. Additionally, 96% of EGFP+ cells in SVZ and 90% in SGZ co-expressed DCX, confirming that our recombination activity was highly specific (Figure 3). Our results showed that the EGFP+ cells were exclusively neuronal, and the absence of DCX expression was observed in only a small fraction of cells, which was attributed to the maturation-associated downregulation of DCX expression over the 5 days of TAM injection."
"The CreERT2 was only temporarily present in the cell nucleus, but the reporter expression was permanently induced following recombination. This allows for the long-term study of the different cell types that arise from DCX+ cells. After one month, the vast majority of the EGFP+ cells in the neurogenic target regions expressed NeuN, indicating that they had matured into neurons. Some of the EGFP+ cells along the neuroblasts' migratory route or localized outside neurogenic regions expressed low levels of DCX. It was found that no EGFP+ cells co-localized with the astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, or microglia markers a month after the last TAM injection. These findings suggest that DCX-expressing cells will inevitably differentiate into neurons under normal conditions. This is in contrast to using the nestin promoter to drive CreERT expression, which resulted in continuous generation of new neurons and glia from the neural stem cell population [17].","While the nuclear translocation of the CreERT2 was transient, the expression of the reporter continued to be induced permanently following recombination, which facilitates the long-term examination of cell types produced from DCX+ cells. After one month of recombination in the DCX-CreERT2, almost all of the EGFP+ cells in the neurogenic target regions exhibited signs of NeuN, which is commonly found in mature neurons. Additionally, a few EGFP+ cells along the migratory path of neuroblasts or outside neurogenic regions expressed a low level of DCX. Importantly, after the last TAM injection, no co-localization was detected between the EGFP signal and markers of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or microglia. This indicates that DCX-expressing cells are committed to neuronal differentiation under normal conditions. This contrasts with the use of the nestin promoter to drive CreERT expression, which generates a continuous flow of new neurons and glia from the neural stem cell population [17].","Upon recombination, the expression of the reporter became permanently induced, even though the nuclear translocation of the CreERT2 was transient. As a result, long-term analysis of the different cell types arising from DCX+ cells is now possible. A month later, the majority of the EGFP+ cells in the neurogenic target regions had matured into neurons that were characterized by NeuN expression. There were a few EGFP+ cells that expressed low levels of DCX and localized either outside neurogenic regions or along the migratory route of neuroblasts. Moreover, there was no co-localization between the EGFP signal and the astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, or microglia markers detected one month after the last TAM injection. These results suggest that under normal circumstances, cells expressing DCX are predetermined to differentiate into neurons. This is in contrast to CreERT expression driven by the nestin promoter, which results in a continuous flow of new neurons and glia generated from the neural stem cell population [17]."
"Calbindin-D28K, calretinin, and parvalbumin are low molecular weight calcium-binding proteins that are found in specific subpopulations of neurons. Calbindin-D28K is present in mature granule cells while calretinin appears in newly generated neurons for a short time. The study observed that EGFP+ granule cells in the dentate gyrus had Calbindin-D28K expression with some low levels of calretinin, and none of them showed parvalbumin expression four weeks after recombination. Further analysis showed no overlap between EGFP and parvalbumin signifying that the GABAergic subpopulation did not replenish with the addition of newly generated neurons in the adult dentate gyrus, although it remains a debated topic.","Calbindin-D28K, calretinin, and parvalbumin are all low molecular weight calcium-binding proteins that are found in distinct neuron subpopulations. Specifically, mature granule cells express Calbindin-D28K while newly generated neurons only transiently express calretinin. The researchers' examination revealed that EGFP+ granular cells located in the dentate gyrus displayed Calbindin-D28K expression, whereas only a few showed low levels of calretinin expression. Notably, none of the cells expressed parvalbumin four weeks after recombination. Moreover, because of the lack of colocalization between EGFP and parvalbumin, there is evidence to suggest that the GABAergic subpopulation in the adult dentate gyrus does not replenish through the continual addition of new neurons, although this phenomenon is a subject of ongoing debate.","Calbindin-D28K, calretinin, and parvalbumin are all members of the low molecular weight calcium-binding protein family and are present in varying subpopulations of neurons. Calbindin-D28K is characteristic of mature granule cells, while calretinin is transiently expressed in newly generated neurons. Within the dentate gyrus, the EGFP+ granular cells expressed Calbindin-D28K, a few of them displayed low calretinin expression, and none of them demonstrated parvalbumin expression four weeks after recombination. The lack of overlap between EGFP and parvalbumin suggests that the GABAergic subpopulation in the adult dentate gyrus is not replenished by the constant addition of new neurons, although the validity of this remains the subject of many debates in the scientific community."
"There were EGFP+ cells discovered in regions of the brain that were not typically related to neuron generation, following recombination in DCX-CreERT mice. In mammals, DCX+ cells have been observed in numerous non-neurogenic parts of the brain such as the temporal and prefrontal cortex layer II, piriform cortex layer III/endopiriform nucleus, corpus callosum, nucleus accumbens, ventromedial striatum, ventrolateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, molecular cell layer, granular cell layer, and white matter of the cerebellum. Superior species of the phylogenetic tree have shown to have a greater occurrence of DCX+ cells; however, it is unclear whether this increase is due to heightened DCX expression levels or greater immunohistochemical detectability [7,8,35-37].","After recombination in DCX-CreERT mice, EGFP+ cells were also found in brain regions that are not typically involved in neuron generation. In mammals, DCX+ cells have been reported in various non-neurogenic areas of the brain, such as the temporal and prefrontal cortex layer II, piriform cortex layer III/endopiriform nucleus, corpus callosum, nucleus accumbens, ventromedial striatum, ventrolateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, molecular cell layer, granular cell layer, and white matter of the cerebellum. The number and distribution of these DCX+ cells appear to rise in more advanced species in the phylogeny, but it is unclear to what extent this is due to an increase in DCX expression levels, leading to better immunohistochemical detectability, or some other factor [7,8,35-37].","In DCX-CreERT mice, EGFP+ cells were observed in brain regions that are not typically related to neuron formation after recombination.

While it has been found that the distribution and frequency of these DCX+ cells are increasing in more advanced species in the phylogenetic tree, it remains to be determined to what extent the increases are due to enhanced DCX expression levels and thus better detectability or other factors [7,8,35-37]."
"The quantity of cells showing EGFP positively in the regions of the 3rd ventricle and hypothalamus was conspicuously greater than the number of cells showing DCX+ in the same areas, which is fascinating. The reason behind this discrepancy could be due to the extremely low level of DCX expression in these cells, making it difficult to detect them using the available antibodies. However, the expression of reporter genes controlled by a powerful constitutive promoter makes it easy to detect targeted cells once DCX-related recombination happens.","Interestingly, the volume of EGFP+ cells detected in the hypothalamus and near the 3rd ventricle was noticeably higher than the quantity of DCX+ cells identified in these areas. The possible reason for this difference is the minimal DCX expression level in these cells, which makes their detection challenging with current antibodies. However, once DCX-related recombination took place, the use of a potent constitutive promoter allows for the straightforward identification of targeted cells through the expression of reporter genes.","It is intriguing to note that the number of EGFP+ cells in the region encompassing the hypothalamus and the 3rd ventricle was remarkably higher than the number of DCX+ cells detected in the same regions. This discrepancy could possibly be due to the very low level of DCX expression in these cells, which makes them almost undetectable using the current antibodies. Conversely, when DCX-associated recombination occurs, the expression of reporter genes becomes under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, leading to an effortless detection of the targeted cells."
"The origin and purpose of DCX-expressing cells beyond the neurogenic regions remain a mystery. However, it has been discovered that neural stem cells can be isolated from nearly all areas within the adult CNS. Moreover, through specific treatment, neurogenic events have been detected in regions such as the cortex, striatum, CA1 area of the hippocampus and even in the white matter. It is tempting to conclude that some of the DCX-expressing cells present in these regions come from a very low-rate continuous neurogenesis. Nonetheless, the absence of BrdU labeling in these cells under normal conditions suggests that this approach of DCX+ cells production would be quite minimal at best.","Investigating the origin and function of DCX-expressing cells outside of the neurogenic regions has yet to be concluded. Studies have found that neural stem cells can be recovered from almost every region of the adult CNS. Also, neurogenic processes have been induced within the adult cortex, striatum, CA1 section of the hippocampus, and even the white matter with specific treatment. There is a possibility that some of the DCX-expressing cells observed in these areas were generated from low-rate continuous neurogenesis. However, due to the lack of BrdU labeling detected in these cells under physiological circumstances, this production may be marginal at best.","The function and origin of DCX-expressing cells that exist outside of the neurogenic regions remain unclear. It has been observed that neural stem cells can be isolated from almost all regions of the adult CNS, and neurogenic events can also be triggered through targeted treatments in areas such as the cortex, striatum, CA1 region of the hippocampus, and even in the white matter. Although some DCX-expressing cells found in these regions may have resulted from low-rate continuous neurogenesis, the lack of BrdU labeling within these cells under normal conditions implies that this mechanism may be marginal in the most favorable scenario."
"The presence of extra-neurogenic DCX-expressing cells is believed to be a result of developmental neurogenesis, where such cells were generated but did not complete their maturation process. Instead, these cells remain as ""quiescent"" local neuronal precursors in the parenchyma. It has also been observed in grafting experiments using neural stem cells that immature neurons remain in the parenchyma, potentially serving as a source of precursor cells for local repair and plasticity. (43, 44)","There is compelling evidence indicating that extra-neurogenic DCX-expressing cells are produced during developmental neurogenesis, but their maturation process is not fully completed, resulting in these cells remaining as ""quiescent"" local neuronal precursors in the parenchyma. Such precursors appear to have been confirmed through grafting experiments where neural stem cells were injected into the ventricles during cortical development. These studies demonstrated that while stem cells integrated into various brain regions as neurons, some cells remained immature neurons in the parenchyma, potentially serving as a store of precursor cells available for local repair or plasticity. (43, 44)","It is suggested by good evidence that extra-neurogenic DCX-expressing cells originate from developmental neurogenesis, but may not undergo complete maturation, resulting in these cells existing as ""quiescent"" local neuronal precursors in the parenchyma. Evidence supporting this view comes from investigations using neural stem cells, which show that some cells remained as immature neurons in the parenchyma after their injection into the ventricles during cortical development. The immature neurons potentially function as a pool of precursor cells available for plasticity or local repair. (43, 44)"
"Another mouse model expressing the DCXCreERT has been recently reported by Cheng et al., which uses a BAC construct to encode the murine DCX promoter. The differences observed between this model and our model, which is based on the human DCX promoter, could be attributed to the latter's potential positional effect of the transgene. Cheng et al.'s model is solely active in DCX-expressing cells within the hippocampus, unlike our mouse model. They have also reported that the induction of their DCXCreERT transgene expression takes place in post-mitotic neuronal precursors. However, since a considerable proportion of all DCX-expressing cells are still in a proliferative state, this indicates a delay in the induction of the transgene expression concerning endogenous DCX. Ultimately, the presented DCX-CreERT mouse model is ideal for studying the maturation and fate of newly generated granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Nonetheless, there remains a lack of models investigating the fate of DCX-expressing cells outside of the dentate gyrus, such as in the subventricular zone (SVZ), which our model can answer.","Researchers recently reported another mouse model that expresses the DCXCreERT, which is different from our model based on the human DCX promoter. Cheng and colleagues used a murine DCX promoter encoded by a BAC construct, which could explain the observed differences between their model and ours. Unlike our model, Cheng et al.'s model is only active in DCX-expressing cells within the hippocampus. Moreover, the authors claim that recombination in their DCX-CreERT mice only occurs in post-mitotic neuronal precursors. This observation implies that the transgene's induction occurs at a later time compared to endogenous DCX, as a significant proportion of DCX-expressing cells are still proliferating. Cheng et al.'s DCX-CreERT mouse model is useful in studying the maturation and destiny of the dentate gyrus's newly generated granule cells. However, there exist no models that address the fate of DCX-expressing cells outside the dentate gyrus, such as those in the subventricular zone, which can be achieved using our model.","Another mouse model expressing the DCXCreERT has been reported, which is different from our model based on the human DCX promoter.

"Despite global efforts to control malaria, the disease remains a significant public health issue, causing almost one million deaths and around 250 million cases every year. The majority of fatalities occur in children under five years old in sub-Saharan Africa. Benin declared malaria as the most critical disease for this age group in 2007, with a significant percentage of medical consultations and hospital admissions attributed to it. The National Malaria Control Programme has implemented recommended prevention and treatment strategies from WHO/GMP, including Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), intermittent preventive treatment (IPT), long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) with carbamate insecticide in specific areas through the President’s Malaria Initiative.","Although there have been significant efforts worldwide to control malaria in the past few years, the disease remains a major public health problem that causes nearly one million deaths and about 250 million cases every year.

"Insecticide treated nets have been proven to decrease uncomplicated malaria episodes by at least 50% in various studies. However, the issue of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors has risen considerably in Africa, especially in Benin. Pyrethroid usage was reduced when applied as either insecticide treated nets or IRS in experimental huts in South Benin due to Anopheles gambiae's resistance to pyrethroids. To handle insecticide resistance, the Centre de Recherche Entomologique de Cotonou (CREC) developed a novel IRM strategy that combines a LLIN and a carbamate treated plastic sheeting in collaboration with the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD) and the NMCP, which has successfully undergone WHOPES phases I and II. As a part of a future community-based evaluation, the malaria burden was assessed in a health district in southern Benin where a nation-wide distribution of LLINs to children below 5 years old had already been carried out in 2007.","It has been demonstrated in numerous studies that insecticide treated nets can reduce uncomplicated malaria episodes by at least 50%. Unfortunately, the prevalence of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors has substantially increased in Africa, particularly in Benin. In South Benin, Anopheles gambiae's resistance to pyrethroids has resulted in reduced efficacy of pyrethroids used as either insecticide treated nets or IRS in experimental huts. To address insecticide resistance, the Centre de Recherche Entomologique de Cotonou (CREC) partnered with the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD) and the NMCP to produce a new insecticide resistance management (IRM) approach that integrates a LLIN and a carbamate-treated plastic sheeting in the same household, which has been effectively evaluated (WHOPES phases I and II). As part of a forthcoming phase III trial, this promising IRM approach is being subject to community-based testing in a southern Benin health district where a countrywide dispersion of LLINs to young children had previously been carried out in 2007.","Studies have shown that the use of insecticide treated nets can lower uncomplicated malaria episodes by up to 50% [6]. However, the increase in insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in Africa, especially in Benin [8-10], is a significant concern. In South Benin, experimental hut studies indicated that pyrethroids' efficacy was reduced when used either in treated nets or IRS due to Anopheles gambiae's resistance to pyrethroids [11, 12].

"A study was conducted to detect malaria cases in a community by conducting active case detection over eight periods of six consecutive days, at six-week intervals throughout the year.

"A study was conducted to examine the epidemiology of malaria in the Ouidah-KpomassèTori Bossito health district after LLINs distribution to children in October 2007. Earlier studies primarily focused on malaria transmission and clinical and parasitological features, both in rural and urban areas of Benin. Other studies have looked at the process indicators for malaria control and the impact of LLIN distribution across Africa. While there is concern regarding pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors in many African countries, there haven't been any reports of LLIN effectiveness being compromised on an operational level.","A prospective longitudinal study was carried out to characterize the malaria epidemiology in the Ouidah-KpomassèTori Bossito health district after the country-wide distribution of LLINs to children in October 2007. Previous literature focused on the malaria transmission as well as the clinical and parasitological aspects of the disease, in both rural and urban areas of Benin. Various authors have also described the process indicators, outcomes, and impacts of malaria control programs, which aided the implementation of the monitoring and evaluation system of ''Roll Back Malaria'' in Benin. Although many studies have investigated the acceptability and population perception of LLINs in Africa, few have explored their parasitological and clinical effects.

"The results of the entomological study depicting the annual EIR in the Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito region suggest that the area is mesoendemic with an average of 5.3 infected bites per annum. The corresponding annual prevalence rate of 21.8% of asymptomatic malaria was observed in young children. The prevalence of the L1014F kdr allele in An. gambiae samples was consistent with previous findings in southern Benin. The age-based increase in the infection rate conforms with the observed pattern in mesoendemic areas. The high infection rate during the dry season may have been influenced by the spike recorded at the end of the rainy season, one month following the nationwide distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs). The parasite density among infected children remained constant across different age groups and seasons, likely attributable to the protection afforded by LLINs. In mesoendemic areas, immunity development against malaria is gradual and reduces parasitaemia with increasing age.","The entomological findings revealed that the Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito health district is mesoendemic, with an average EIR of 5.3 infected bites per year. This was accompanied by a 21.8% annual prevalence rate of asymptomatic malaria in young children. Velema's parasitological observations two decades earlier in the same region had yielded similar results. The L1014F kdr allele frequency was found to be 50%, consistent with earlier research in southern Benin. As is typical of mesoendemic areas, the annual infection rate increased with age. The spike in infection rate during the dry season could be attributed to the peak observed at the end of the rainy season, which occurred only a month after the distribution of LLINs nationwide. The parasite density in infected children remained uniform across all age groups and seasons, likely due to the protection provided by LLINs. In mesoendemic areas, immunity to malaria develops gradually, leading to decreased parasitaemia with increasing age.","The study's entomological data indicated that the Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito area has a mesoendemic status, with an average EIR of 5.3 infected bites per year. This was corroborated by an annual prevalence rate of 21.8% for asymptomatic malaria in young children. The results are consistent with previous parasitological findings from the same region two decades prior. The L1014F kdr allele, which confers resistance to pyrethroids, was present in 50% of An. gambiae samples, aligning with previous studies in southern Benin. The annual infection rate increased progressively with age, as is typical of mesoendemic regions. The dry season's high infection rate may have been influenced by a peak observed at the end of the rainy season, which coincided with the distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) across the country.

"The optimal cutoff value for pyrogenic parasite was identified as 2,000 P. falciparum asexual blood forms per μL through the AF of pathological episodes to malaria. Using AF to define the cut-off value allowed for an improved balance between sensitivity and specificity level. In malaria-endemic areas, the malaria-AF and the appropriate parasite density cutoff to define malaria cases can be influenced by factors such as season and age. However, the present study found that parasite density remained constant regardless of these factors, making the AF a reliable parameter for defining the pyrogenic parasite cutoff in all seasons and age groups. The identified cutoff value is comparable to those found in mesoendemic and hyperendemic areas, further supporting its validity in defining malaria cases.","The ideal pyrogenic parasite cutoff of 2,000 P. falciparum asexual blood forms per μL was determined using the AF of pathological episodes to malaria. Employing AF to define the cutoff value improved the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity level for malaria diagnosis. In areas with stable malaria, factors such as season and age can impact the malaria-AF and consequently the cutoff value for parasite density to define malaria cases. However, this study's findings suggested that parasite density did not vary with age or season. Hence, the AF could be considered the same for all age groups and seasons. The 2,000 cutoff value is similar to those found in mesoendemic areas on children under 3 years and in hyperendemic areas among children aged 0 to 12 years in the south of Benin, further confirming its suitability for diagnosing malaria.","By using the AF of pathological episodes to malaria, a parasite pyrogenic cutoff of 2,000 P. falciparum asexual blood forms per μL was determined to be optimal. The use of AF in defining this cutoff allowed for an improved balance between sensitivity and specificity level for malaria diagnosis. P. falciparum parasitaemia in stable malaria areas is known to be influenced by season and age, which can impact the malaria-AF and therefore the cutoff value for parasite density to diagnose malaria. However, this study found that parasite density did not differ by season or age. As a result, the AF was presumed to be consistent for all age groups and seasons. The identified cutoff of 2,000 was similar to values found in mesoendemic areas among children under 3 years and in hyperendemic areas among children aged 0 to 12 years in southern Benin, further supporting its validity in diagnosing malaria."
"In the health district of Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito, one third of pathological cases were linked to malaria, and to avoid missing cases, the definition for malaria cases considered signs and symptoms of malaria or previous fever within 48 hours of the start of ACD, following the recommendation of McGuinness (33). The mean incidence rate for falciparum clinical malaria was 1.5 cases per child per year. In areas with a high prevalence of P. falciparum, the pyrogenic threshold for parasitaemia in people of a given age is similar for all Plasmodium species (56). P. malariae may have been responsible for one clinical case of malaria with 2,360 parasites/μL, while P. ovale may have caused two cases with parasitaemia of 4,800 and 9,800 parasites/μL, respectively, due to the high level of parasitaemia.","Within the Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito health district, malaria was identified as the cause of one-third of all pathology cases, and in order to prevent missed cases, the case definition for malaria included consideration of symptoms indicative of malaria, or fever that had occurred within 48 hours of ACD, as advised by McGuinness (33). The average incidence rate of falciparum clinical malaria per child each year was 1.5. In areas of high-endemicity for P. falciparum, the pyrogenic cut-off for parasitaemia in persons of a specific age is the same across all Plasmodium species (56). Given the elevated parasite density, P. malariae could plausibly have been the cause of one clinical case of malaria displaying 2,360 parasites/μL, with P. ovale potentially causing two instances of high parasitaemia with 4,800 and 9,800 parasites/μL, respectively.","The health district of Ouidah-Kpomassè-Tori Bossito revealed that malaria was responsible for one-third of all pathological events, and in order to avoid overlooking cases, the definition of malaria cases included signs indicating malaria or a history of fever in the 48 hours preceding the ACD's initial day as recommended by Mcguinness (33). The mean number of falciparum clinical malaria cases per child per year was 1.5. In areas of P. falciparum high-endemicity, the pyrogenic cut-off point for parasitaemia in individuals of a particular age remained uniform across all Plasmodium species (56). Given the significant level of parasite density, one case of malaria with 2,360 parasites/μL may have been attributable to P. malariae, while two instances of malaria with parasitaemia levels of 4,800 and 9,800 parasites/μL, respectively, may be associated with P. ovale."
"Prior to the national distribution of LLINs in 2001, only 4.3% of households in the south of Benin owned treated nets (ITNs), and only 2.4% of children under five slept under them.

"To establish precise quantification of the findings under ideal conditions, it was necessary to use approximately 100 starting template copies, and this determined the LOQ of the assay. When the concentration of template copies fell below 100, the Ct values were beyond the linear range (as demonstrated in Figure 2). Although it was possible to detect the target sequence in all of the amplification reactions with as little as 10 copies present, it was not detectable if only one copy was present (as represented in Figure 3). These outcomes suggest that the LOD value was about 10 copies.","The assay required the use of approximately 100 starting template copies in ideal conditions to produce reliable quantitation of the results, setting the LOQ. Conversely, when the number of copies fell below 100, the Ct values moved out of the linear range, as illustrated in Figure 2. All amplification reactions showed the detection of the target sequence until the copy number reduced to 10, beyond which it was not detectable when only a single copy was present, according to Figure 3.

"As per the reports, PCV2-induced diseases have been found to be causing an increase in the mortality rate of pigs, which can range from 2-3% to 14-30%. Hence, it has become critical for the pig industry and the research community to have quick and sensitive detection and quantitation methods for PCV2. TaqMan real-time PCR is becoming more prevalent due to being highly sensitive and less prone to contamination than conventional PCR. Conventional PCR can give false-positive results when products are examined in gels because of the contamination risk. Real-time PCR is faster and more sensitive than conventional PCR, making it highly beneficial for PCV2 detection.","According to research, PCV2-related diseases lead to an increase in pig mortality of 2-3% up to 14-30%. Due to this alarming statistic, a need has arisen for the pig industry and the research community to have accurate and sensitive detection and quantitation assays for PCV2. Real-time PCR methods using TaqMan technology are becoming the preferred option over conventional PCR techniques since they offer greater sensitivity and are less susceptible to contamination. The main problem with conventional PCR is contamination, which can lead to false positives when examining products in gels. Real-time PCR is a faster, more sensitive approach that requires less time than conventional PCR, and is therefore widely adopted for PCV2 detection.","Reported data shows that PCV2-induced diseases are responsible for 2-3% up to 14-30% mortality rates among pigs. This has created an immediate need for rapid and accurate testing methods to detect and quantify PCV2 in both the pig industry and research community. Compared to conventional PCR, TaqMan real-time PCR is a more sensitive and less susceptible to contamination assay. A primary disadvantage of conventional PCR is that contamination can occur when products are examined in gels, causing false-positive results in subsequent experiments. Conversely, real-time PCR is widely implemented, with increased sensitivity and quicker testing periods than conventional PCR."
"The most appropriate reference fragment to detect PCV2 is located in ORF2 and is known as the major conserved region, as it exhibits the most diversity between PCV1 and PCV2, and there are more sequenced isolates for PCV2 than PCV1. Previous studies have mainly utilized hybridization probes that bind to the target products for PCV2 detection, resulting in high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Various other methods exist for measuring PCV2, including using TaqMan probes, TaqMan real-time PCR, and SYBR Green I, as demonstrated by several researchers in detecting and measuring PCV2 levels in different tissues and serum samples.","Detecting PCV2 requires identifying the major conserved region located in ORF2, which is the most appropriate reference fragment because of the significant diversity it displays between PCV1 and PCV2, along with the availability of sequenced isolates for PCV2 compared to PCV1.

"There are roughly 110 million cases of malaria diagnosed every year in Nigeria, which means that roughly 50% of Nigeria's adult population experiences a malaria episode yearly. Unfortunately, young children may suffer from even more attacks of up to four to five times a year. Moreover, the country endures a vast economic setback due to malaria, estimated to be around 132 billion Naira (equivalent to 878 million USD) in losses annually. Hence, in 1996, the Nigerian authorities came up with their first comprehensive National Malaria Control Policy, followed by instigating the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) initiative in 1999 to tackle this egregious problem.","Nigeria sees around 110 million cases of clinical malaria diagnoses yearly, with almost 50% of adults across the country experiencing at least one episode. For young children, the numbers are higher, with two to four attacks annually. This translates to a significant economic loss for Nigeria, with malaria costing around ~132 billion Naira (close to 878 million USD) annually. To combat this calamity, the Nigerian government finally created its first National Malaria Control Policy in 1996, and Roll Back Malaria (RBM) scheme commenced in 1999.","Nigeria suffers nearly 110 million clinical cases of malaria diagnoses per year, with almost half of the adults experiencing at least one attack annually, while young children have up to two to four bouts of malaria.

"National drug efficacy studies conducted in Nigeria in 2002 revealed that chloroquine and sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) were no more effective as the first-line therapy for malaria. This informed the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in 2005, with artemetherlumefantrine selected as the ideal first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria, with artesunate-amodiaquine (AS + AQ) used as an alternative. Currently, SP is not recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to its increased resistance, which may reach 35%; however, it is still in use for intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) in pregnant women. There is a potential for cross-resistance caused by a similarity in the structure of SP and SMP.","Based on national drug efficacy trials conducted in Nigeria in 2002, it was discovered that chloroquine and sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) were no longer effective as first-line treatments for malaria. In response, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) was introduced in 2005, with artemetherlumefantrine serving as the preferred first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria, and artesunate-amodiaquine (AS + AQ) as an alternative. At present, SP is not used as a treatment for uncomplicated malaria due to its high resistance, which can reach up to 35%. Nonetheless, it continues to be used for intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) in pregnant women.

As a result of the similarity in the structure of SP and SMP, cross-resistance is a possibility."
"Despite the fact that ACT has been in use for several years as a treatment for uncomplicated malaria, its utilization in the field is still below expectations. This is down to poor availability and/or high costs in the African market. The RBM strategy prioritizes the need for malaria patients to access adequate treatment within 24 hours of symptom onset. Any anti-malarial drug intended for home use should be affordable, easy to use, safe, effective and preferably packaged into a single dose. Fixed-dose combinations (FDC) are the preferred treatment option over co-blistered drugs as they prevent inadequate dosing and increase compliance, which ultimately leads to the prevention of drug resistance.","The use of ACT for uncomplicated malaria treatment has been introduced many years ago, but its utilization in the field is still not meeting expectations due to poor availability and/or relatively high costs on the African market. One of the key objectives of the RBM strategy is to ensure that patients suffering from malaria have access to proper and adequate treatment within twenty-four hours of the onset of symptoms. An ideal anti-malarial drug for home use should be safe, effective, affordable, and easy to administer, preferably with a single-dose package.

"The combination of artesunate and sulphamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine (AS + SMP) appears to offer a promising alternative option for treating malaria when first-line drugs are unavailable, given its profile for an ideal antimalarial drug. This drug is safe and easy to administer, with high efficacy rates observed regardless of whether it is administered over a 24- or 48-hour period in various regions [3-5]. Formerly packaged as a co-blistered drug [6,7], it now comes in a fixed-dose combination (FDC), which makes it easy for malaria patients to take (just three tablets). In addition, the SMP element offers secondary advantages due to its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, which could aid in the detection and treatment of illnesses that have been incorrectly diagnosed as malaria [8,9].","When first-line treatments for malaria are not readily available, the combination of artesunate and sulphamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine (AS + SMP) is an intriguing alternative which aligns well with the ideal characteristics of an antimalarial drug. It has a strong safety profile and several studies have shown high efficacy rates when taken over 24 or 48 hours in endemic areas [3-5]. The co-blistered form of the drug was previously offered [6,7], but is now available in a fixed-dose combination (FDC) requiring only three tablets for ease of use by malaria patients. Furthermore, SMP has broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, offering a valuable ancillary benefit in detecting and treating infections that might have been initially misdiagnosed as malaria [8,9].","The AS + SMP (artesunate and sulphamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine) combination is an intriguing alternative for treating malaria when first-line treatments are unavailable, as it appears to meet many of the ideal criteria for an antimalarial drug.

"After assessing the eligibility of the children, they were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. The respective treatments were administered by the recruiting physician at the clinic. One group was given three doses of artesunate/amodiaquine crushed tablets (Amonate®, Dafra Pharma ltd., Kenya) mixed with clean water at 0, 24, and 48 hours. The other group received artesunate/sulphamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine crushed tablets (CoArinate FDC ® Junior, Dafra Pharma Ltd., Kenya) mixed with water and administered at 0, 12, and 24 hours. Depending on their age group, the children were given a full tablet or half a tablet per dose. The patients were monitored for vomiting for 1 hour after receiving the drug. If vomiting occurred within 30 minutes, the full treatment dose was repeated, and half the treatment dose was repeated if vomiting occurred between 30-60 minutes.","Following the initial screening to confirm eligibility, the children were allocated randomly to one of two treatment groups, based on a pre-defined randomization code.

"A number of African countries have implemented artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) as their first-line treatment against uncomplicated malaria, mainly AL and AS + AQ. Nevertheless, taking into account the field occurrences, it is crucial to explore other varieties of ACTs to determine another suitable treatment choice in case those suggested medications are not easily accessible to urgent patients.

"The findings of this study are consistent with previous research on AS + SMP from both malaria-endemic and non-endemic areas [3-7]. Additionally, the AS + AQ cure rate observed in this study is comparable to what other studies have reported [16-18]. Since there were more children under five years old in the AS + AQ group, they may have faced relatively weaker immune systems and thus had a lower ability to clear malaria parasites. Moreover, even though the AS + SMP group experienced more losses to follow-up than the AS + AQ group (21 versus 12), this difference likely arose from changes in school attendance and other social factors as opposed to drug efficacy. The fact that 3,500 children had to be screened to attain the desired sample size of 250 individuals per treatment arm indicates that many fever cases in children may be caused by bacterial infections instead of malaria [9]. Nevertheless, even in cases of misdiagnosis, the SMP component of AS + SMP may still offer clinical advantages to children with bacterial infections based on its antimicrobial effects.","The results of this study are in line with prior investigations conducted on AS + SMP in both malaria-endemic and non-endemic regions [3-7]. Similarly, the cure rate for AS + AQ reported in this study is comparable to that of other studies [16-18]. The notable difference in the age distribution of under-five-year-olds in the AS + AQ group could have contributed to their reduced ability to clear malaria parasites due to their relatively weaker immune systems. Also, while the AS + SMP group had a significantly higher loss-to-follow-up rate than the AS + AQ group (21 versus 12), this difference might not be linked to drug efficacy but to changes in school attendance and family social issues. The need to screen 3,500 children to identify the 250 individuals required for each treatment arm indicates that many fever cases in children could be caused by bacterial infections rather than malaria [9]. Even though there was no parasitological confirmation, the SMP component of AS + SMP would provide clinical benefits to wrongly diagnosed children with bacterial infections based on its antimicrobial properties.","The outcomes of this study are consistent with previous research conducted on AS + SMP in both endemic and non-endemic malaria areas [3-7]. Moreover, the cure rate of AS + AQ observed in this study is similar to that reported in other studies [16-18]. The difference in the proportion of children under five in the AS + AQ group may have contributed to their decreased ability to clear malaria parasites owing to their weaker immunity. Additionally, the AS + SMP group showed a substantially higher loss to follow-up rate than the AS + AQ group (21 versus 12), but this may be attributed to changes in school attendance and other social circumstances as opposed to drug efficacy. The necessity to screen 3,500 children to reach the required sample size of 250 individuals for each treatment group indicates that a significant number of fever cases in children might be caused by bacterial rather than malaria infections [9]. Regardless of the lack of parasitological confirmation, the SMP component of AS + SMP may still provide clinical benefits to children erroneously diagnosed with malaria as it has antimicrobial properties."
"Gametocyte carriage rates were comparable between the two treatment arms both before and after treatment, as artesunate may have been responsible for this outcome. Conversely, sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) treatment was found to elevate gametocyte carriage after resolution of uncomplicated malaria infection, which was not observed with SMP therapy. In addition, Sowunmi et al reported no increase in gametocyte carriage with AQ + SMP treatment despite a slower clearance of the sexual parasitaemia in children in comparison to their AL counterparts.","The rates of gametocyte carriage were similar in both treatment groups before and after treatment, which may be attributed to the efficacy of artesunate. Although sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) treatment is known to increase the carriage of gametocytes post-treatment of uncomplicated malaria infection, this did not turn out to be the case with SMP. In fact, even though AQ + SMP treatment led to a slower clearance of sexual parasitemia in children compared to those on AL treatment, it did not cause an increase in gametocyte carriage according to Sowunmi et al.","Following treatment, the rates of gametocyte carriage were similar between the two groups, which may be attributed to the effectiveness of artesunate. In contrast, sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) therapy was found to increase gametocyte carriage post-treatment of uncomplicated malaria infection, but this was not the case with SMP. Sowunmi et al observed slower clearance of sexual parasitemia in children treated with AQ + SMP and not those treated with AL, although there was no increase in gametocyte carriage with the former."
"The two treatment regimens, AS + SMP and AS + AQ, appeared to be well-tolerated, with no significant difference observed between the frequency of adverse events reported. It was challenging to distinguish adverse events from symptoms associated with malaria. The incidence of itching in patients treated with AS + AQ was found to be low, similar to what had been reported in previous studies. None of the children reported any severe adverse events such as icterus or intravascular haemolysis. However, patients treated with AS + SMP had a significantly lower packed cell volume during follow-up, possibly due to the high frequency of G6PD deficiency in the study area. A comprehensive screening for G6PD deficiency in all patients could have verified this finding.","Both AS + SMP and AS + AQ treatments were well-tolerated, and the incidence of adverse events reported was similar in the two groups. Since the symptoms of malaria often overlap with adverse events, it was difficult to differentiate the two. Notably, the occurrence of itching in patients treated with AS + AQ was low, which was consistent with the findings of an earlier study. None of the children reported any serious adverse events such as icterus or intravascular haemolysis. However, patients treated with AS + SMP had a lower packed cell volume during follow-up, which might be due to the high incidence of glucose six phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in the area. To confirm this observation, screening for G6PD deficiency would have been necessary for all patients.","The study found no significant difference in the frequency of adverse events between both AS + SMP and AS + AQ treatments. However, distinguishing between adverse events and malaria-related symptoms was a challenge. It is worth mentioning that the occurrence of itching was infrequent among patients treated with AS + AQ, which is consistent with the results of a prior study. None of the children who participated in the study reported severe adverse events such as icterus or intravascular haemolysis. Still, a decrease in packed cell volume was observed in patients treated with AS + SMP during follow-up. This finding may relate to a high prevalence of G6PD deficiency prevalent in the study's geographical location; thus, screening all patients for G6PD deficiency would have substantiated this conclusion."
"In conclusion, the study demonstrates that AS + SMP FDC administered thrice within a 24-hour period with 12-hour intervals is equally as effective as AS + AQ FDC administered thrice within a 48-hour period with 24-hour intervals in fever and parasite eradication for children in Nigeria suffering from uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Both drugs are proven safe, although AS + SMP has a higher chance of re-infection. AS + SMP is a viable substitute to recommended first-line treatments in locations where it is not available, or the cost is too high. However, cross-resistance between SP and SMP could happen, so progress monitoring of drug resistance is essential.","The study's findings indicate that for children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Nigeria, administering AS + SMP FDC in three doses within 24 hours (with a 12-hour interval) is just as effective as giving AS + AQ FDC in three doses within 48 hours (with a 24-hour interval). Both drugs have demonstrated safety, with AS + SMP showing slightly higher re-infection rates. AS + SMP can be a good alternative to standard first-line treatments in areas where they are unavailable or too costly. However, potential cross-resistance between SP and SMP necessitates ongoing surveillance of drug resistance.","In essence, the study reveals that AS + SMP FDC, given as three doses over 24 hours with 12-hour intervals, is just as effective as AS + AQ FDC, given as three doses over 48 hours with 24-hour intervals, for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children in Nigeria when it comes to fever reduction and parasite eradication. Both drugs have a proven track record of safety, but AS + SMP has a higher risk of re-infection. AS + SMP may be a valuable replacement for first-line treatments in areas where accessibility and affordability remain a challenge. However, because of potential cross-resistance between SP and SMP, continuous monitoring for the development of drug resistance is critical."
"Chronic depression is a significant problem in public health around the world. Although there are medications available for depression, they come with severe side effects, and not all patients respond well to them, leaving them in an unsatisfactory state. The cause of depression is not entirely comprehended, leading to the inability to create powerful drug treatment. However, existing research has confirmed a probable interaction between immunological transformations and major depression. When rodents are injected with certain pro-inflammatory cytokines or bacteria, they exhibit sickness behavior, leading to depressive behavior, including decreased food intake, social isolation, circadian rhythms, and movement.","Chronic depression poses a major public health challenge across the globe. Although there are multiple drugs available for the treatment of depression, they often cause significant side effects, and some patients do not respond satisfactorily to them. Due to an incomplete understanding of the etiology of depression, developing more effective medications is challenging. Nevertheless, recent literature indicates that there is a correlation between changes in the immune system and severe depression. Studies have revealed that when given some pro-inflammatory cytokines or bacterial products, rodents undergo sickness behavior that is followed by depressive behavior, accompanied by reduced food intake, social isolation, alters in the circadian cycle, and immobility.","Chronic depression is a global public health concern. While multiple depression treatments exist, they may come with significant side effects, and some patients may not respond satisfactorily to the available therapies. A lack of complete understanding of depression's causes refrains from developing more effective treatments. However, literature provides evidence of connectivity between major depression and immunological changes. Some bacterial products or pro-inflammatory cytokines act systemically, causing sickness behavior with characteristics like reduced food intake, circadian disturbances, social isolation, and reduced mobility in rodents. These changes progress to depressive behavior."
"Toll-like receptors (TLR) perform the function of recognizing microbial structures, where TLR4 is mostly signaled by Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), leading to the activation of different intracellular routes [6]. Research has proved that cytokine production plays an essential role in LPS-induced depression-like behavior in rodents, and depressed patients exhibit a high level of cytokine plasma [2,3]. Besides, in rats, TLR activation due to infection results in systemic inflammation and signs of brain-controlled sickness [7,8].","Toll-like receptors (TLRs) act as recognition units that distinguish different microbial structures. Among these receptors, TLR4 is commonly activated by Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), leading to intracellular pathway activation [6]. Studies have demonstrated that LPS causes depression-like behavior in rodents, which relies on cytokine production. Interestingly, elevated cytokine plasma levels have also been observed in patients with depression [2,3]. Additionally, recent research has revealed that TLR activation caused by infection can result in systemic inflammation and show signs of brain-controlled sickness in rats [7,8].","Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are responsible for identifying microbial structures, with TLR4 particularly affected by Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and triggering the activation of various intracellular pathways [6].

Furthermore, research has revealed that TLR activation due to infection can induce systemic inflammation and manifest brain-controlled illness in rats [7,8]."
"Kinins are a group of peptides that are produced quickly in response to different stimuli. Upon release, they activate two receptors known as B1 and B2, which are coupled to G proteins. B2 receptors are present in many tissues, while B1 receptors are usually not expressed under normal conditions but are rapidly increased after infection, trauma, or cytokine exposure. TNFa plays a critical role in inducing kinin B1 receptors, as demonstrated by previous research. Therefore, B1 receptors may be activated under specific pathological conditions, playing a role in various chronic pain and inflammatory processes.","Kinins are a type of peptides that are quickly produced in response to a variety of stimuli. These peptides then activate two G protein-coupled receptors called B1 and B2. B2 receptors are found in several tissues, while B1 receptors are not usually expressed under normal conditions but are upregulated rapidly after infection, trauma, or cytokine exposure. Studies have shown that the upregulation of kinin B1 receptors is influenced by TNFa. Thus, B1 receptors are likely to be induced in specific pathological situations and might be involved in a range of chronic inflammatory and painful diseases.","Kinins are peptides that are generated in response to different stimuli.

Notably, TNFa is an important factor in activating kinin B1 receptors, as evidenced by previous studies. As a result, B1 receptors are more likely to be expressed in certain pathological conditions and may be implicated in various chronic inflammatory and pain pathologies."
"Based on previous studies, cytokine production resulting from E. coli or P. gingivalis can cause an increase in kinin B1 receptor expression in animals models of peripheral inflammation [14,15,18]. Recent research has suggested that kinin B1 receptors might also play a role in CNS diseases like epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and neuropathic pain [19-21]. To investigate whether B1 receptor participation contributes to depression-like behavior following systemic administration of E. coli LPS in mice that have undergone swimming as a stressor, we conducted this study. This experimental approach is based on the concept that internal and external stressors can interact to cause a general illness state leading to allostatic overload [2,22,23]. Biochemical and molecular techniques like flow cytometry, ELISA, and real-time PCR were utilized to understand some of the factors responsible for B1 receptor induction in depressed LPS-treated animals, and immunohistochemical investigations were used to explore the impact of kinin B1 receptor antagonism on glial activity.","Prior investigations have exhibited that animal models of peripheral inflammation showed a marked increase in the kinin B1 receptor expression following cytokine production by either P. gingivalis or E. coli [14,15,18].

"The results presented in Figure 1a illustrate that, in mice, the administration of E. coli LPS (450 μg/kg, i.p.) systemically, following a 5-minute session of forced swimming, led to depression-like behavior. The tail-suspension paradigm showed the increase in immobility time in animals treated with LPS to be statistically significant at 24 hours (P < 0.01), with a return to baseline at 48 hours (P < 0.05), but not at 6 hours (P > 0.05). As expected, imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), a typical antidepressant drug, resulted in a substantial decrease in the immobility time (47 ± 16% of reduction; Figure 1a) when given 30 minutes before the behavioral evaluation. Interestingly, the depression-like behavior brought about by LPS was significantly inhibited with the help of i.p. treatment of selective B1 receptor antagonists, such as R-715 (0.5 mg/kg, 30 min), SSR240612 (5 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min), or oral administration of SSR240612 (10 mg/kg, 1 h), suggesting that B1 receptor antagonists may play a role in the treatment of depression. However, in our model, the selective kinin B2 receptor antagonist FR173657 (30 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min) failed to produce a significant change in the immobility time (P > 0.05; Figure 1b).","In Figure 1a, the results indicate that mice exhibited depression-like behavior after receiving E. coli LPS (450 μg/kg, i.p.) systemically, following a 5-minute forced swimming session.

"Despite extensive research on the impact of LPS treatment on rodents, the effects of administering E. coli LPS to mice that have been subjected to forced swimming have been shown to produce classical CNS-associated effects (as described in references [3-5]). Our results also support this notion, demonstrating a significant reduction in body temperature (as indicated in Figure 1e) and locomotor activity in open-field arena tests. These effects were most pronounced six hours after LPS administration but had largely subsided after 24 hours (as shown in Figure 1f). While administering R-175 (at 0.5mg/kg) 30 minutes prior to testing had no significant impact on body temperature after six hours, we continued our experiments using SSR240612 as it has good oral bioavailability.","Our research builds on existing studies that have investigated the effects of LPS treatment on rodents. Our findings support previous literature, demonstrating that administering E. coli LPS to mice previously subjected to forced swimming can result in CNS-associated changes, including a marked decrease in body temperature and locomotor activity. In particular, locomotor activity was significantly reduced at six hours after LPS administration (with levels returning to baseline at 24 hours), and body temperature was significantly reduced at the six-hour mark (with no significant change observed at 24 hours). Interestingly, administering R-715 (at 0.5mg/kg) 30 minutes beforehand did not have a significant impact on body temperature at the six-hour mark.

"B1 receptor expression in CNS structures and its correlation with the impact of selective kinin B1 receptor antagonists were investigated. Mice were subjected to a session of forced swimming and then LPS administration (450 μg/kg, i.p.). B1 receptor mRNA expression was measured in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. The findings from quantitative real-time experiments revealed a significant time-dependent increase in B1 receptor mRNA levels in the hippocampus, which peaked at 1 h (about 2.5-fold increase) (Figure 2a), and a considerable 40-fold increase in the cortex 1 h after LPS treatment (Figure 2b).","In order to determine whether the influence of selective kinin B1 receptor antagonists was connected to changes in B1 receptor expression in CNS structures, B1 receptor mRNA expression levels were examined in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice that were exposed to forced swimming and LPS administration.

Quantitative real-time experiments revealed that B1 receptor mRNA levels rose significantly over time, reaching a maximum peak in the hippocampus at 1 h (about 2.5-fold increase) (Figure 2a). Moreover, in the cortex, this increase was almost 40-fold 1 h after LPS treatment (Figure 2b)."
"Figure 3 demonstrates that administering LPS treatment following forced swimming caused a remarkable upsurge in CD68 immunoreactivity in the mouse hippocampus. This indicates that glial cell activation increases under these conditions. Interestingly, CD68 labeling was largely suppressed by pre-treating animals with SSR240612, a selective kinin B1 receptor antagonist (5 mg/kg, i.p.), 30 minutes before LPS, while imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) had no such effect. These findings suggest that imipramine and kinin B1 receptor antagonist operate via different mechanisms to exert their antidepressant-like effects. In many cases, reduced expression of neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF, has been linked to depression. Our study showed that BDNF expression in the mouse hippocampus significantly decreased at both the 6- and 24-hour time points following our depression protocol, with levels dropping by approximately 50%. However, pre-treating animals with SSR240612 (5 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 minutes before LPS treatment did not significantly affect this variable, as shown in Figure 4.","As Figure 3 demonstrates, there was a marked increase in CD68 immunoreactivity in the mouse hippocampus when LPS treatment followed forced swimming, indicating activation of glial cells. Notably, pre-treatment with SSR240612 (5 mg/kg, i.p.), a selective antagonist of the kinin B1 receptor, 30 minutes before LPS administration, almost completely suppressed CD68 labeling, while imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) had no observable effect. These findings suggest that imipramine and kinin B1 receptor antagonist act via different mechanisms to produce antidepressant-like effects.

"The researchers aimed to establish a correlation between the changes caused by LPS and cytokine production. To accomplish this, they evaluated the levels of TNFa in the entire brain or mouse serum. The mice were subjected to forced swimming and injected with E. coli LPS, leading to a considerable, gradual increase in TNFa production in the brain and serum. The TNFa levels peaked in serum between 1 and 3 hours, displaying a 90-fold increase, and returned to regular levels after six hours. In contrast, in the brain, the TNFa levels reached their maximum values between 3 and 6 hours after LPS injection, with an 1.8-fold augmentation, decreasing to control levels after 12 hours. The researchers also studied cytokine content in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of LPS-treated mice, using flow cytometry analysis. The results revealed that CSF cytokines IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-g were not detected in the system. IL-12's concentration was similar to that observed in naïve animals. Notably, CSF TNFa levels showed a 340 and 90-fold increase, peaking one hour after LPS injection and remaining elevated for three more hours.","The primary objective of the study was to establish a relationship between the changes induced by LPS and cytokine production. To achieve this, the researchers analyzed TNFa levels in the entire brain or mouse serum. Mice were made to swim forcefully and then given E. coli LPS, which resulted in an evident and gradual increase in TNFa production in the brain and serum. TNFa levels peaked between 1 and 3 hours in serum, indicating a 90-fold increase, and returned to normal after six hours. In comparison, the TNFa levels found in the brain increased to their maximum between 3 and 6 hours after LPS injection, displaying a 1.8-fold increase and returning to control levels after 12 hours.

"In order to investigate the role of TNFa in depression-like behavior, we utilized TNFa p55 receptor deficient mice. Previous literature data had suggested a close relationship between TNFa and B1 receptor upregulation. The C57/BL6 mouse strain was used as they were inbred with TNFa p55 receptor knockout animals. In this study, a dose of 1000 μg/kg of E. coli LPS was needed to induce a significant increase in immobility time in the tail-suspension test in C57/BL6 mice which was comparable to the 450 μg/kg dose in CF1 mice. Upon treatment with forced swimming plus LPS (1000 μg/kg, i.p.), the depression-like behavior was significantly reduced in mice that were genetically deficient in TNFa p55 receptors compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, the increase of B1 receptor mRNA expression in mice subjected to forced swimming plus LPS was absent in TNFa p55 receptor knockout animals.","The role of TNFa in depression-like behavior was further explored in this study since previous literature data show that TNFa and B1 receptor upregulation are closely related. To achieve this, TNFa p55 receptor-deficient mice were utilized. Inbred C57/BL6 mice were used since they were already TNFa p55 receptor knockout animals. A dose of 1000 μg/kg of E. coli LPS was required to cause a significant increase in immobility time in the tail-suspension test in C57/BL6 mice, which corresponded to a 1.5-fold increase compared to saline-treated animals as seen in CF1 mice given a 450 μg/kg dose. When mice were administered forced swimming plus LPS, the depression-like behavior was almost non-existent in mice lacking TNFa p55 receptors unlike wild-type mice. Moreover, there was no increase in the expression of B1 receptor mRNA in TNFa p55 receptor-deficient mice subjected to forced swimming plus LPS, unlike those with the receptor.","The study aimed to examine the role of TNFa in the observed depression-like behavior using previous findings that showed a connection between TNFa and B1 receptor upregulation. Utilizing TNFa p55 receptor-deficient mice, the researchers looked to establish the importance of TNFa in the observed depression and used C57/BL6 mice, which are inbred with TNFa p55 receptor knockout animals. It was established that a 1000 μg/kg dose of E. coli LPS was required to cause a significant increase in immobility time in mice subjected to the tail-suspension test, similar to the level seen in CF1 mice given a 450 μg/kg dose. The depression-like behavior induced by forced swimming plus LPS decreased significantly in the absence of TNFa p55 receptors. Moreover, TNFa p55 receptor knockout animals showed no increase in B1 receptor mRNA expression following forced swimming plus LPS treatment."
"During the past few years, there have been significant developments in our comprehension of the genetic, biochemical, and immunological changes associated with depression. Recent research has highlighted certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1b, and TNFa, as crucial molecules contributing to depression-related behaviors following infection. These cytokines may help to coordinate the body's local and systemic responses to pathogens. In a study involving mice, administration of LPS after a brief swimming session resulted in earlier signs of sickness behavior, including reduced body temperature and locomotor activity, six hours post-LPS, followed by later signs of depression-like behavior, such as increased immobility time in the tail suspension test, 24 hours post-LPS. This supports previous studies that suggest sickness behavior is a normal initial response to infectious stimuli, but depression-like states may persist even after the sickness has resolved initially.","Over the last few years, significant strides have been made in understanding the genetic, biochemical, and immunological changes associated with depression. Studies have identified specific pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, IL-1b, and TNFa, as central players in depression-related behaviors following infection. These cytokines are believed to be responsible for coordinating responses to pathogens on both a local and systemic level. In an experiment using mice, researchers found that administering LPS after a short swimming session resulted in earlier signs of sickness behavior, such as reduced body temperature and locomotor activity, six hours after LPS injection, followed by later depression-like behavior, evidenced by an increase in immobility time in the tail suspension test, 24 hours post-LPS. This result is consistent with previous findings that suggest sickness behavior is an expected initial response to infectious agents, but depression-like states may persist long after any accompanying sickness has subsided.","In the last few years, there have been significant advances in our comprehension of the genetic, biochemical, and immunological modifications pertinent to depression. According to research, certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, IL-1b, and TNFa, play an essential role in depression-related behaviors subsequent to infection. These cytokines are thought to manage the body's response to pathogens locally and systemically. In a study on mice, administration of LPS after a brief swimming session caused reduced body temperature and locomotor activity, 6 hours after LPS injection, indicating signs of sickness behavior followed by an increase in immobility time in the tail suspension test, demonstrating depression-like behavior post-LPS 24 hours after injection. Such results are in accord with prior literature that suggests sickness behavior is an ordinary initial response to infectious stimuli, but depression-like states may remain even after recovery from sickness behavior."
"There is currently no previous study that has established a correlation between depression and kinin B1 receptors. These receptors are typically not present in the peripheral nervous system under normal circumstances but are rapidly up-regulated in response to stressful stimuli. Interestingly, they are found in certain areas of the brain and spinal cord such as the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and choroid plexus epithelial cells. While it is not fully understood what exact role kinins play in the brain, the presence of B1 receptors in the nervous system suggests a potential central role for them. This research aims to investigate if B1 receptors might be involved in the development of depression-like behavior caused by pre-stressful stimuli and LPS.","To our knowledge, there have been no studies investigating the possible correlation between depression and kinin B1 receptors.

"The results of the study revealed that the antidepressant imipramine was effective in reducing the depression-like state observed in the tail suspension test in stressed rodents. Moreover, treatment with either selective B1 receptor antagonists R-715 or SSR240612 significantly inhibited the increased immobility, indicating the relevant role of B1 receptors in depression-like behavior. The study also found marked increase in B1 receptor mRNA expression in the hippocampus and cortex of mice that were subjected to forced swimming plus LPS administration. These findings suggest that infection associated with a stressful stimulus may up-regulate B1 receptors in the CNS, leading to depressive behavior, and highlights the significant role of alterations in hippocampal plasticity in depression. In addition, our study did not find any significant effect of the selective B2 receptor antagonist FR173657 on immobility time in the depression paradigm, which is in line with the proposed physiological roles of kinin B 2 receptors.","The study showed that the antidepressant imipramine was successful in reducing the depression-like state observed in the tail suspension test in stressed rodents.

Real-time PCR experiments conducted as part of the study showed a significant increase in B1 receptor mRNA expression in the hippocampus and cortex of mice that underwent forced swimming plus LPS administration. This study's results indicate that infection related to a stressful stimulus may increase B1 receptor activity in the CNS, contributing to depressive behavior. The study also found evidence that changes in hippocampal plasticity contribute to depression. The study found no significant impact of the selective B2 receptor antagonist FR173657 on immobility time in the depression paradigm.

"Upon considering the functional data obtained from the tail suspension test and the anhedonia paradigm of sucrose intake, SSR240612 was found to significantly reverse reduced sucrose consumption in LPS-treated mice. This is noteworthy as depression is often accompanied by anhedonic states where pleasure sensations are decreased or missing. Furthermore, it was found that Swiss mice who underwent stressful forced swimming and LPS administration experienced a significant decline in sucrose consumption, but this symptom was reversed by the antidepressant imipramine, thus affirming the validity of the experiment. On the other hand, the administration of the B1 receptor antagonist R-715 had no significant effect on sickness behavior-induced hypothermia, indicating that blocking B1 receptors can reverse later depression-like symptoms without interfering with early sickness behavior, which is primarily coordinated by cytokines.","The results of the anhedonia paradigm of sucrose intake, in addition to the functional data obtained from the tail suspension test, showed that SSR240612 reversed the reduced sucrose consumption in LPS-treated mice. Given that depression often results in anhedonic states where pleasure sensations are reduced, this finding is significant. The experiment also discovered that Swiss mice experienced a significant decline in sucrose consumption due to stressful forced swimming and LPS administration, which was reversed by the antidepressant imipramine. This confirms the reliability of the experiment. Furthermore, the B1 receptor antagonist R-715 did not significantly affect sickness behavior-induced hypothermia. This suggests that blocking B1 receptors can alleviate later depression-like symptoms without interfering with the early sickness behavior, which is primarily coordinated by cytokines.","By utilizing the anhedonia paradigm of sucrose intake alongside functional data obtained from the tail suspension test, results have shown that SSR240612 can entirely reverse reduced sucrose consumption in LPS-treated mice. This finding is noteworthy as depression often results in anhedonic states where pleasure sensations are reduced or even missing. Additionally, the experiment revealed that Swiss mice subjected to  stressful forced swimming plus LPS administration experienced a considerable decrease in sucrose consumption, but this symptom was reversed through the use of the antidepressant imipramine, effectively reinforcing the experiment's validity. Conversely, administering the B1 receptor antagonist R-715 did not lead to significant changes in sickness behavior-induced hypothermia. This suggests that blocking B1 receptors can reverse later depression-like symptoms without interfering with the early sickness behaviour, mainly coordinated by cytokines."
"The immune-competent components of the CNS that play a crucial role in depression pathogenesis include microglia and astrocytes [43, 47, 48]. Our study found that following forced swimming and LPS treatment, there was activation of microglia in mice, as indicated by an increase in CD-68 immunostaining in the hippocampus after 24 hours of LPS injection, once B1 mRNA levels returned to baseline. Activated microglia release neurotoxic mediators such as pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to various injuries [3,49]. Our data reveal that the selective non-peptide B1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 significantly curtailed CD-68 immunopositivity, indicating an inhibition in microglial activation. However, imipramine did not significantly alter this parameter. Therefore, it can be deduced that microglial activation inhibition is linked with the antidepressant-like effects of B1 receptor antagonists, not those caused by imipramine. These findings offer valuable insights into understanding depressive states associated with infections.","Microglia and astrocytes are major immunocompetent components of the CNS that are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of depression [43, 47, 48]. Our study demonstrated that forced swimming and LPS treatment led to the activation of microglia in mice. This was evidenced by an increase in CD-68 immunostaining in the hippocampus at 24 hours post-LPS injection, which coincided with the return of B1 mRNA levels to baseline. Upon injury, activated microglia are known to release neurotoxic mediators such as pro-inflammatory cytokines [3, 49]. Our findings indicate that the selective non-peptide B1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 had a significant impact on reducing CD-68 immunopositivity, while imipramine did not. Hence, we propose that the antidepressant-like effects of B1 receptor antagonists are related to the inhibition of microglial activation and not to imipramine's effects. These results are worthy of attention and may help us understand depressive states, especially those associated with infections.","The CNS's major immunocompetent constituents that likely play a role in depression pathogenesis are astrocytes and microglia [43, 47, 48]. Our study uncovered that forced swimming followed by LPS administration caused microglia activation in mice, which was evident from the increased CD-68 immunostaining in the hippocampus 24 hours after LPS injection, corresponding with B1 mRNA levels returning to normal. Microglial activation in response to injury is recognized to prompt the release of neurotoxic mediators, including pro-inflammatory cytokines [3, 49]. Notably, our data suggests that the selective non-peptide B1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 effectively curbs CD-68 immunopositivity, whereas imipramine did not. Therefore, B1 receptor antagonist antidepressant-like effects, but not those resulting from imipramine, may be related to microglial activation inhibition. These results are significant and may pave the way for understanding depressive states, particularly those linked with infections."
"Depression is associated with changes in synaptic plasticity that result in decreased BDNF function and other biochemical alterations. Under stressful conditions, the BDNF gene can be repressed, leading to neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus. Interestingly, animal models have shown that BDNF infusion in certain brain regions can have antidepressant-like effects. Most monoaminergic antidepressant drugs can restore normal BDNF transcriptional levels. In our depression model, there was a sustained reduction in BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus for up to 24 hours. The selective B1 receptor antagonist SSR240612 did not significantly change BDNF mRNA expression, despite preventing microglial activation. This suggests that SSR240612 appears to have an antidepressant-like effect through a different mechanism than most antidepressants, acting primarily through an inflammatory pathway rather than affecting BDNF.","Changes in synaptic plasticity that lead to decreased BDNF function and other biochemical alterations are closely linked with depression. Stressful conditions can suppress the BDNF gene, which results in neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus. Intriguingly, animal models have indicated that administering BDNF to specific brain regions can have antidepressant-like effects. Additionally, most monoaminergic antidepressant medications can return BDNF transcriptional levels to normal. Our depression model showed that BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus sustained a reduction for up to 24 hours. Notably, though SSR240612, the selective B1 receptor antagonist, prevented microglial activation, it did not significantly alter BDNF mRNA expression. SSR240612's antidepressant-like activity, therefore, appears to operate through a different inflammatory pathway than those of typical antidepressants and not via BDNF interference.","Depression is associated with changes in synaptic plasticity, which lead to decreased BDNF function and other biochemical changes.

"Pro-inflammatory cytokines are a key factor in the pathogenesis of depression, as directly stated above. The expression of soluble TNFa receptors in individuals with major depressive disorder is particularly high. Using TNFa antagonists to treat patients leads to a reduction in depressive symptoms and an improvement in quality of life. These findings are reinforced by this study, which shows that LPS administration in pre-stressed mice leads to a significant increase in TNFa levels in serum, CSF, and whole brain. Serum TNFa levels are responsible for sickness behavioral changes, while the increase in TNFa levels in the brain causes depression-like behavior. TNFa levels in CSF also showed a marked increase.","It is well-established that pro-inflammatory cytokines play a significant role in the pathogenesis of depression. Patients with major depressive disorder show a higher expression of soluble TNFa receptors, and treatment with TNFa antagonists leads to improvements in depressive symptoms and overall quality of life. This study further supports this hypothesis by demonstrating that LPS administration in pre-stressed mice results in a notable increase in TNFa levels in serum, CSF, and whole brain. The TNFa production initially increases in serum and then in the brain. The study suggests that the increased TNFa levels in serum contribute to sickness behaviors such as hypothermia and reduced locomotor activity, while the elevated TNFa levels in the brain may be responsible for depression-like behaviors. Additionally, TNFa levels in CSF showed a marked increase between 1-3 hours.","As mentioned earlier, pro-inflammatory cytokines are heavily involved in the development of depression. Surprisingly, patients who have major depressive disorder showed an increase in the expression of soluble TNFa receptors. Patients who were treated with TNFa antagonists showed a boost in life quality and also an improvement in depressive symptoms. This study proves the hypothesis by displaying how LPS administration escalates the level of TNFa in serum, CSF, and the whole brain of pre-stressed mice. The production of TNFa was initially enhanced in the serum between 1-3 hours and in the whole brain between 3-6 hours. The finding suggests that the increase of TNFa levels in the serum leads to sickness-like behavioral changes such as low body temperature and decreased locomotor activity while its enhancement in the brain engenders depression-like behavior. Furthermore, there was a marked increase in TNFa levels in CSF collected from LPS-treated mice between 1 and 3 hours, while other cytokine levels remained constant."
"The presence of TNFa in the CSF suggests that there is a way for the brain to communicate with the immune system. When the toll-like receptors on the macrophage-like cells in the circumventricular receptors are activated, they release proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFa. However, because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is relatively impermeable to cytokines, it is unclear how circulating cytokines might affect brain function. Cytokines could potentially enter the brain through volume diffusion or through areas where the BBB is compromised, such as during stressful or immunologically-challenging events, according to a commonly-accepted theory. Moreover, kinins can cause problems for the BBB, which would disrupt its functioning and lead to a variety of neurological conditions, such as depression, which are linked to the entry of cytokines into the brain.","The fact that TNFa is present in the CSF supports the idea that there is a communication pathway between the immune system and the brain. When macrophage-like cells in the circumventricular receptors receive signals from toll-like receptors, it triggers the release of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFa [3]. However, since the BBB is relatively impermeable to cytokines, it remains unclear how circulating cytokines might affect brain function, even though the circumventricular organs lie outside the BBB. One theory suggests that cytokines may be able to pass through the BBB via volume diffusion [3, 58] and by penetrating sites where the BBB is somewhat compromised. Stressful events or immunologic challenges like those used in our protocol may cause the BBB to become compromised, allowing cytokines to enter the brain [34]. Kinnins can also disrupt the BBB, leading to neurological conditions related to cytokine entrance into the brain, such as depression [59,60].","The presence of TNFa in the CSF seems to indicate that there is communication between the brain and immune system. Macrophage-like cells in the circumventricular receptors produce proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFa, when their toll-like receptors are stimulated [3]. Since the BBB is relatively impermeable to cytokines, it is still uncertain how circulating cytokines might affect brain function, even though the circumventricular organs lie outside the BBB. One theory suggests that cytokines may be able to enter the brain via volume diffusion [3,58]. Additionally, they may be able to cross the BBB in areas that are somewhat compromised due to stressful events or immunologic challenges, such as those used in our protocol [34]. Kinins can cause the BBB to dysfunction, further leading to various neurological conditions relating to cytokine-entry into the brain, such as depression [59,60]."
"After employing TNFa p55 receptor-KO mice, we gained further insights into the relevance of TNFα in our experimental paradigm. Our research indicated that the depression-like behavior and upregulation of B1 receptors, which were induced by forced swimming plus LPS treatment, were substantially eliminated in the mice lacking TNFα p55 receptors. Our group had already established the importance of TNFα in B1 receptors upregulation [14-17]. Thus, our experimental evidence explicitly suggests a link between the TNFα cytokine and kinin B1 receptor upregulation in depression genesis. Additionally, our data provide strong evidence that pro-inflammatory cytokine generation plays a pivotal role in B1 receptor upregulation induced by LPS, as we had already demonstrated [14].","Using TNFa p55 receptor-KO mice, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the relevance of TNFa in our experimental model.

Our group had already established the significance of TNFa in the upregulation of B1 receptors [14-17]. Our experimental findings imply a possible link between the TNFa cytokine and kinin B1 receptor upregulation in the genesis of depression. We also present strong evidence that generating the pro-inflammatory cytokine might be critical in inducing B1 receptor upregulation by LPS, as we had demonstrated previously [14].","In our experimental paradigm, we utilized TNFa p55 receptor-KO mice to determine the relevance of TNFa.

Our previous studies had already established the importance of TNFa in B1 receptor upregulation [14-17]. The present study adds to our understanding by showing a clear association between the TNFα cytokine and kinin B1 receptor upregulation in depression genesis. Additionally, our data suggests that LPS-induced upregulation of B1 receptors may depend critically on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα, as we had previously demonstrated [14]."
"It is widely accepted among experts that depression should be viewed as a syndrome rather than a disease. Current research suggests a link between depression and the immune system, with cytokines and other immune mediators acting as ""sensor"" molecules to transform noncognitive stimuli into cognitive stimuli recognized by the central nervous system. Peripheral inflammatory events may impact central factors and behavior, and the participation of kinin B1 receptors in depressive alterations may be associated with microglial activation and production of TNFa in the brain.

"Type I interferons (IFNs) have a crucial role in the innate immune response, as well as in the induction of adaptive immunity against viral infections. When the body encounters a viral infection, it triggers the production of type I IFNs (IFN-a/b) [1, 2]. These type I IFNs are responsible for activating hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that encode antiviral proteins and cytokines, providing the host with protection against further viral infections [3, 4].","Type I interferons (IFNs) have a vital function in both the innate immune response and the development of adaptive immunity in response to viral infections. When the body detects a viral infection, it triggers the production of type I IFNs (IFN-a/b) [1, 2].

"The main viral sensors in most mammal cells are RNA helicases, RIG-I, and MDA-5. RIG-l and MDA-5 recognized viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), respectively. TLR3 can also recognize viral dsRNA in most cells.

"Though host cells have evolved several types of cellular signalling to identify and combat viral infection, most viruses have the ability to thwart these immune defenses to a certain extent [7,11]. Many viruses, such as those that have discovered how to block IFN synthesis or meddle with the functions of IFN, for example, have developed various tactics to evade the IFN reaction [12].","Despite the range of cellular signalling mechanisms that have evolved in host cells to detect and respond to viral infection, most viruses possess mechanisms to avoid these host immune responses in different ways [7,11].

"The ability of influenza A viruses to resist interferon (IFN) is linked with the non-structural gene (NS) [13-16]. Recent studies have shown that the NS gene responsible for influenza A viruses contains two proteins. These proteins are produced through the translation of unspliced mRNA, which creates a 26 kDa protein termed non-structural protein 1 (NS1). On the other hand, a nuclear export protein of 14 kDa (NEP), earlier known as NS2, develops by the translation of spliced mRNA [18].","The viral anti-IFN activities demonstrated by influenza A viruses are attributed to the NS gene [13-16].

"The NS1 protein works against the initiation of IFN-b [19,20] and negatively impacts the capability of a variety of IFN-triggered proteins that prevent virus growth in the body, including protein kinase R (PKR) and 2’-5’oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) [21-23].","The NS1 protein antagonizes both the production of IFN-b [19,20] and the efficiency of many IFN-activated proteins that possess antiviral properties, namely protein kinase R (PKR) and 2’-5’oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) [21-23].","The NS1 protein thwarts the induction of IFN-b [19,20] and the function of numerous antiviral IFN-stimulated proteins, including protein kinase R (PKR) and 2’-5’oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) [21-23]."
"The NS gene is divided into two gene pools, referred to as alleles A and B [24,25]. NS1 proteins between allele A and B have a nucleotide identity of 63-68% and an amino acid identity of 66-70%. Allele A is more prevalent and is the only subtype found in strains adapted to mammals. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of avian allele A and B viruses with that of human viruses revealed six amino acid motifs between human and avian allele A viruses and 35 motifs between human and allele B viruses, implying that allele B viruses are less similar to mammalian-origin viruses [26].

"It has been previously discovered that differences in the NS1 protein of H10 avian influenza viruses are linked to their pathogenicity in minks (Mustela vison).

We observed that both NS1s caused a significant suppressive effect on luciferase activity. However, ""mink/84"" appeared to be more potent, with an average decrease of 6.8 folds (85.3%) in A549 cells (Figure 1A), while ""chicken/49"" caused an average decline of 20.8% in A549 cells.","We conducted an analysis to investigate the ability of NS1 derived from ""mink/84"" and ""chicken/49"" to inhibit the induction of transcription of the IFN-b gene. To do so, we utilized the ISRE-Luciferase and Poly I:C stimulation model system, which depends on the expression of IFN and subsequent signaling from the IFN-a/b receptor, resulting in ISRE reporter gene expression. Our findings show that both NS1s displayed a significant suppressive impact on luciferase activity, but the impact of ""mink/84"" was considerably stronger, causing an average 6.8-fold decline (85.3%) in A549 cells (Figure 1A), while ""chicken/49"" induced an average decline of 20.8% in A549 cells.","In this study, we assessed the capacity of NS1 from ""mink/84"" and ""chicken/49"" to hinder the initiation of transcription of the IFN-b gene.

Our results demonstrated that both NS1s caused a significant suppressive effect on the luciferase activity. Nonetheless, ""mink/84"" appeared to be much more potent, resulting in an average decline of 6.8 folds (85.3%) in A549 cells (Figure 1A), whereas ""chicken/49"" resulted in an average decline of 20.8% in A549 cells."
"The western blot analysis was performed to ascertain whether the variance in IFN-b promoter inhibition was due to insufficient expression or a difference in NS1 proteins in A549 cells. The expression level of NS1 proteins was confirmed by lysing the cells at 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours post-transfection and conducting Western blotting. The results indicated that both the 'mink/84' and 'chicken/49' constructs expressed NS1 proteins in high quantity, and there was no notable difference between the two constructs in terms of allele A and allele B NS1 protein levels (Figure 1B). The expressed proteins from both constructs were also homogenously accumulated in A549 cells (Figure 1B). Thus, the discrepancy in IFN-b induction in the presence of allele B NS1 protein was not due to differences in the protein's expression or accumulation in the cells.","In order to determine whether the IFNb promoter's inhibition difference was caused by insufficient expression or variation in the NS1 proteins in A549 cells, the researchers conducted western blot analysis to validate the expressed NS1 proteins' level. The cells were lysed at different time intervals following transfection (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours), and western blotting was carried out. The results showed that the NS1 proteins from both ""mink/84"" and ""chicken/49"" constructs were highly expressed, with comparable levels of allele A and allele B NS1 protein (Figure 1B). The western blotting further revealed that there was homogenous accumulation of the expressed protein from both constructs in A549 cells, with no noticeable dissimilarity between alleles in terms of NS1 production (Figure 1B). Hence, the findings indicated that the discrepancy in IFN-b induction in the presence of allele B NS1 protein was not due to a difference in NS1 protein expression and accumulation in the cells.","In order to establish whether the disparity in IFNb promoter inhibition was due to insufficient expression or differentiation in NS1 proteins in A549 cells, the researchers used western blot analysis to affirm the level of expressed NS1 proteins.

The results indicated that both the 'mink/84' and 'chicken/49' constructs expressed NS1 proteins in high quantities, with a similar level of allele A and allele B NS1 proteins (Figure 1B). The western blotting also demonstrated that the expressed protein from both constructs were evenly accumulated in A549 cells, with no significant dissimilarity between alleles in terms of NS1 protein production (Figure 1B). The results suggested that the difference in IFN-b induction in the presence of allele B NS1 protein was not due to a variation in NS1 protein expression and accumulation in the cells."
"It was ambiguous whether the obtained result was caused by differences in the ability to suppress the production of IFN or the influence on the ISRE transcription signaling pathway or both. To clarify this, measurement of IFN protein production was conducted using ELISA.","It was unclear whether the outcome was the result of variations in the capability to downregulate IFN production, or if the signaling pathway, which leads to ISRE transcription, was affected, or both. To resolve this question, an ELISA was used to measure IFN protein production.","It was uncertain whether the observed result corresponds to differences in the ability to reduce IFN production, the influence on the ISRE transcription signaling pathway, or both. To disentangle this, an ELISA was carried out to measure the production of IFN protein."
"The production of IFN-b protein, after being stimulated by poly I:C, was detected in the cell medium of control cells following a delay of 2 to 4 hours. The IFN-b levels escalated linearly in the cell culture supernatant, and the highest levels were attained 16 to 24 hours after stimulation (Figure 2A). Although cells transfected with different NS1s produced low levels of IFN-b, there were significant variations between the NS1s. Mink/84 virus NS1-protein-expressing cells were not as good at producing IFN-b, with levels secreted being at least 10 times lower than those of control cells in the cell culture supernatant. In these cells, IFN-b secretion reached the maximum yield 8 hours post-stimulation, and then the levels declined rapidly for the remaining experiment period. The NS1 protein of chicken/49-expressing cells produced lower IFN-b levels, but the profile was comparable to that of the control cells (Figure 2A). Therefore, it was inferred that NS1 in this system suppresses IFN protein production rather than IFN receptor signalling.","The control cells showed detection of the IFN-b protein in the cell medium 2 to 4 hours after the stimulation of poly I:C, followed by a linear increase of IFNb in the cell culture supernatant. The highest yield values were recorded 16 to 24 hours post-stimulation (Figure 2A). Despite low levels being secreted by the cells transfected with different NS1s, significant differences were seen among them. IFN-b secretion was considerably weaker in cells that expressed the NS1 protein of the ""mink/84"" virus. The levels detected in the cell culture supernatant were at least 10 times lower in comparison to the control cells. The maximum peak yield for IFN-b secretion was seen 8 hours after the stimulation, which quickly dropped down to low levels for the remainder of the experiment. On the contrary, the NS1 protein of ""chicken/49"" expressing cells were better at producing IFN-b, with similar profiles as the control cells but lower levels (Figure 2A). These results indicate that the NS1 protein suppresses IFN protein production rather than signalling from the IFN receptor in this system.","Detection of the IFN-b protein in the cell medium of control cells occurred between 2 to 4 hours after stimulation by poly I:C. A subsequent linear increase of IFNb in the cell culture supernatant led to peak levels being attained 16 to 24 hours post-stimulation (Figure 2A). While the cells transfected with various NS1s produced low levels of IFN-b, significant differences were observed within these NS1s. ""Mink/84"" virus NS1 protein-expressing cells showed weak production of IFN-b, with secreted levels being at least 10 times lower in comparison to the control cells in the cell culture supernatant. In these cells, the peak yield for IFN-b secretion was reached 8 hours after the stimulation, and then it decreased rapidly for the remainder of the study. On the other hand, cells expressing the NS1 protein of ""chicken/49"" were better at producing IFN-b but had a lower profile compared to the control cells (Figure 2A). Therefore, it is concluded that NS1 protein in this system suppresses IFN protein production rather than signalling from the IFN receptor."
"In order to investigate whether the decrease in IFN-b production occurred due to the inhibition of IFN-b gene expression, we conducted a comparison of the gene expression kinetics in A549 cells which were exposed to poly I:C in the presence or absence of various NS1 proteins.","To determine whether the suppression of IFN-b production was a result of the inhibition of the IFN-b gene expression, we analyzed the gene expression kinetics of A549 cells that were stimulated with poly I:C in the presence or absence of different NS1 proteins.","In order to ascertain whether the decline in IFN-b production was due to the dampening of the IFN-b gene expression, we compared the gene expression kinetics of A549 cells stimulated with poly I:C in the presence or absence of various NS1 proteins."
"The experiment showed that the IFN-b mRNA levels increased throughout the experiment in the control cells shown in Figure 2B, which was also observed in cells expressing the NS gene of ""chicken/49"" in Figure 2C. The cells in the control group showed a significant increase in transcript levels 2 to 4 hours after stimulation, reaching a plateau by the end of the experiment. Figure 2D demonstrated that the NS1 protein of ""mink/84"" effectively suppressed IFN-b gene transcription 4 hours after stimulation in A549 cells. Additionally, the activation of the IFN-b gene expression in cells expressing the NS gene of ""chicken/49"" resulted in increased levels of IFN-b mRNA, following a pattern similar to that of the control cells.","Figures 2B and 2C indicated an increase in IFN-b mRNA levels in the control cells and cells expressing the NS gene of ""chicken/49,"" respectively, throughout the experiment. Within the control cells, there was a significant rise in transcript levels 2 to 4 hours post-stimulation, which then leveled off by the end of the experiment. The NS1 protein of ""mink/84"" was shown in Figure 2D to powerfully suppress IFN-b gene transcription in A549 cells 4 hours following stimulation. On the other hand, the transfection of plasmids containing the NS gene of ""chicken/49"" and the resultant activation of the IFN-b gene expression led to increased levels of IFN-b mRNA, indicating a comparable trend to that of the control cells.","The experiment's outcomes demonstrated increasing levels of IFN-b mRNA in the control cells shown in Figure 2B and those expressing the NS gene of ""chicken/49"" as per Figure 2C throughout the study period. The transcript levels in the control cells showed a significant increase between 2 and 4 hours with the plateau attained by the end of the experiment. The NS1 protein of ""mink/84"" suppressed IFN-b gene transcription effectively in A549 cells four hours after stimulation, as shown in Figure 2D. Furthermore, the activation of the IFN-b gene expression in cells that had transfected plasmids carrying the NS gene of ""chicken/49"" caused an increase in the IFN-b mRNA levels, maintaining the same rising trend as that seen in the control cells."
"The NS1 protein of ""mink/84"" effectively inhibits the transcription of the IFN-b gene in stimulated A549 cells, as confirmed by the RT-PCR analysis of the INF-b mRNA. This suggests that the primary target of the NS1 protein in ""mink/84"" is to minimize the expression of IFN. The same analysis was done in A549 cells expressing NS1 of ""chicken/49,"" and the results were comparable.","According to the RT-PCR analysis of the INF-b mRNA, the NS1 protein in ""mink/84"" successfully repressed the transcription of the IFN-b gene in A549 cells that were stimulated. This implies that the primary objective of the ""mink/84"" NS1 protein is to inhibit the induction of IFN. The study also indicated that A549 cells expressing NS1 of ""chicken/49"" exhibit the same response to stimulation, as seen in the RT-PCR analysis of INF-b mRNA.",The RT-PCR examination of INF-b mRNA expressed in stimulated A549 cells with NS1 from “mink/84” or “chicken/49” demonstrated the effectiveness of the NS1 protein in "mink/84" in suppressing the transcription of IFN-b gene in the cells. This infers that the fundamental activity of the NS1 protein in "mink/84" is to hinder the initiation of IFN. The results of the study prove that A549 cells expressing NS1 of "chicken/49" also experienced the same degree of repression in response to stimulation.
"Influenza A viruses employ a key strategy to avoid triggering the host's immune response. They do this by restraining IFN-a/b expression or signalling between cells. Such signalling would otherwise stimulate transcription from genes that contain an ISRE promoter. Thus, virus-infected cells are not induced into an antiviral state. To achieve this goal, the viral protein NS1 plays a major role in regulating innate immunity. NS1 contains a C-terminal effector domain and an N-terminal RNA binding domain. The effector domain interacts with proteins that process cellular mRNA, such as the mRNA export machinery and components of the nuclear pore complex. This results in inhibition of mRNA export and pre-mRNA splicing of host cell transcripts. Meanwhile, the RNA binding domain binds to both single- and double-stranded RNA. This binding inhibits signalling and activation of various antiviral proteins, such as RIG-I, PKR, OAS/RNase L, activators of transcription factors, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and those involved in type I IFN and inflammatory cytokine signalling.","The influenza A virus has a primary tactic to evade the host's immune response by impeding the IFN-a/b expression or signalling between nearby cells. The reason is to stop antiviral activity that may be stimulated by transcription from the ISRE promoter-containing genes. The NS1 viral protein plays a significant part in modulating innate immunity by suppressing the host's immune responses through its two functional domains: the RNA binding domain and an effector domain. The effector domain interacts with proteins that engage in mRNA processing, suppressing mRNA export and pre-mRNA splicing of host cell transcripts, and interacting with constituents of the nuclear pore complex and mRNA export machinery. Simultaneously, the RNA binding domain binds single- and double-stranded RNA, inhibiting the activation and signalling of antiviral proteins, transcription factors controlling type I IFN and inflammatory cytokine signalling, as well as activating mitogen-activated protein kinase.","To avoid the host immune response, one of the primary strategies used by influenza A viruses is to impede IFN-a/b expression or signalling between neighbouring cells, as it may trigger antiviral activity generated by transcription from ISRE promoter-containing genes. Innate immunity is mainly regulated by the NS1 viral protein, which inhibits host immune responses via its two distinct functional domains - the RNA binding domain and effector domain. The effector domain interacts with proteins required for cellular mRNA processing, thereby inhibiting the export of mRNA and pre-mRNA splicing of host cell transcripts, and interacts with the nuclear pore complex and mRNA export machinery. Whereas, the RNA binding domain binds to single and double-stranded RNA, thereby inhibiting the activation and signalling of antiviral proteins, mitogen-activated protein kinase, transcription factors involved in type I IFN, inflammatory cytokine signalling, as well as RIG-I, PKR, and OAS/RNase L activators."
"Our previous study had concluded that the NS1 protein is a potential crucial factor in the various pathogenicity levels exhibited by H10 avian influenza viruses in mink.

These viruses contained different NS alleles, one from A (""mink/84"") and the other from B (""chicken/49""). An analysis of the anticipated amino acid sequences of both NS1 proteins revealed that there were 71 amino acid differences (in Figure 3).

"The NS1 proteins of ""mink/84"" and ""chicken/49"" were almost identical except for one difference: the CPSF30 interaction site. This specific site plays an important role in NS1's ability to interact with the 30kDa subunit of CPSF, which inhibits 3'-end processing of cellular premRNA. The NS1 protein's function is regulated by two domains, one located around residue 186 and another around residues 103 and 106. The NS1 protein of ""mink/84"" contained Glu186, Phe103, and Met106, whereas the NS1 protein of ""chicken/49"" had Tyr103. Changing these interaction sites could have a significant impact on how NS1 controls the expression of host genes, as evidenced by a prior study.","The NS1 proteins of ""mink/84"" and ""chicken/49"" were practically indistinguishable, except for a single difference observed in the CPSF30 subunit interaction site. This site is integral to the NS1 protein's capacity to interact with CPSF30, which, in turn, inhibits 3'-end processing of cellular premRNA. There are two domains implicated in this function, the first surrounding residue 186 and the second around residues 103 and 106. The NS1 protein of ""mink/84"" had Glu186, Phe103, and Met106 while the NS1 protein of ""chicken/49"" had Tyr103.

"MOLT-4 cells exposed to compound 1i at 10.0 and 16.7 μM for 24 hours resulted in an increase in the sub-G1 fraction, indicating activation of cell death pathways. The higher concentration had a more pronounced effect.

This finding suggests that compound 1i induces apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis also revealed an increase in the S and G2/M phases. The increase in S phase fraction could be due to DNA synthesis stimulation or delay in cell movement from S to G2/M phase. The increase in G2/M fraction implies that daughter cells are delayed in exiting the mitotic cycle, leading to reduced tumor cell number due to delayed cell turnover.","Upon exposure to compound 1i for 24 hours, MOLT-4 cells at 10.0 and 16.7 μM showed an increase in sub-G1 fraction, suggesting an upregulation of cell death machinery.

"Treatment of MOLT-4 cells with compound 1i resulted in a significant increase in both caspase-3 and caspase-6 activities, indicating the occurrence of cell death through the apoptotic pathway. The highest up-regulation of caspase-3 was observed at 5.0 μM concentration, 12 hours following treatment, while the peak of caspase-6 activity was observed at the same concentration 24 hours after treatment.

"I will rewrite a paragraph that is similar in meaning to the original paragraph given. MOLT-4 cells were subjected to compound 1i at concentrations of 5 and 10 μM, and their morphology was examined using light microscopy at various time intervals. With an increase in the concentration of the compound and a longer incubation period, the number of cells undergoing apoptosis also increased. Following 36 hours of incubation with a 10 μM concentration of compound 1i, characteristic features of apoptotic cells such as the marginalization of chromatin material, cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation/fragmentation, and the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles were observed (Figure 6b), which are considered hallmarks of apoptosis. On the other hand, the control cells exhibited larger sized nuclei with nucleoli (Figure 6a).","I will rewrite the given paragraph, retaining its original meaning. MOLT-4 cells were treated with compound 1i at 5 and 10 μM concentrations, and their morphology was analyzed through light microscopy at several time intervals. The frequency of apoptotic cells increased with higher dosages of the compound and more extended incubation times. An image of cells exposed to a 10 μM concentration of compound 1i for 36 hours (Figure 6b) demonstrated apoptotic features, including chromatin marginalization, cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation/fragmentation, and vacuolation of the cytoplasm, which are regarded as indicators of apoptosis.

At a concentration of 10 μM after 36 hours of incubation, the characteristic signs of apoptosis had developed (as shown in Figure 6b) such as chromatin marginalization, cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation/fragmentation, and cytoplasmic vacuole formation.

"Based on the results of transmission electron microscopy, MOLT-4 control cells showed a high nucleocytoplasmic ratio, finely dispersed chromatin in the nucleus, and visible nuclear pores. Most of these cells also exhibited noticeable nucleoli, and variously sized and shaped mitochondria with cristae, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and ribosomes. However, treatment with 10 μM of compound 1i for 36 hours led to a significant reduction in rough endoplasmic reticulum and damaged mitochondrial cristae, indicating the initiation of apoptosis. There was no evidence of a necrotic event, as there were no inflammatory changes in the nuclei and cytoplasm and no incident of plasma membrane breakage. Additionally, vacuolization was found in the treated cells, which corroborated previous observations presented in the literature [16, 17].","In the context of transmission electron microscopy, MOLT-4 control cells stood out due to their high nucleocytoplasmic ratio, finely dispersed chromatin in the nucleus, and visible nuclear pores.

Conversely, treatment with 10 μM of compound 1i for 36 hours led to significantly reduced rough endoplasmic reticulum, and numerous damaged mitochondrial cristae, which hinted at the early stages of apoptosis. Fortunately, there was no evidence of necrosis, as there was no inflammatory changes in either the nuclei or the cytoplasm of the treated cells, and there was no plasma membrane breakage. Ultimately, this research builds on what was previously documented, with the treated cells also showing distinct vacuolization in agreement with similar studies[16, 17].","Using transmission electron microscopy, the MOLT-4 control cells appeared quite different with their high nucleocytoplasmic ratio, visible nuclear pores, and nuclear chromatin that dispersed finely.

On the other hand, treating MOLT-4 cells with 10 μM of compound 1i for 36 hours adversely affected their rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial cristae, pointing towards apoptotic changes. This study did not show evidence of necrosis, with no indications of inflammatory changes in the nuclei and cytoplasm or any damage in the plasma membrane, which ruled out the possibility of necrosis. Instead, the treated cells displayed distinctive vacuolization, which is supported by similar observations made in previous literature [16, 17]."

Exposure of the tumor cells to test compounds at a concentration of 8 μM resulted in a gradual and significant inhibition of 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine incorporation, similar to that of mitonafide at the same concentration. After 1 hour of incubation, compound 1d and 1i reduced 3H-thymidine incorporation by 96% and 95% respectively, compared to mitonafide which caused a 95% reduction. The compounds demonstrated significant inhibitory effects on DNA synthesis, while the inhibition of RNA synthesis was less pronounced. Mitonafide, compound 1d, and 1i led to 92%, 94%, and 89% inhibition of 3H-uridine incorporation, respectively (Figure 8).","In an attempt to determine whether compound 1d and 1i could inhibit tumor growth by affecting nucleic acid synthesis, studies were performed to investigate their similarities in structure to mitonafide.

Over a 60 minute period, untreated cancer cells displayed a linear pattern of 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine incorporation. However, when exposed to the test compounds at a concentration of 8 μM, a gradual and significant reduction in 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine incorporation comparable to that of mitonafide was observed. After 1 hour of exposure, compound 1d and 1i inhibited 3H-thymidine incorporation by 96% and 95%, respectively, compared to a 95% reduction by mitonafide. These compounds showed remarkable inhibitory effects on DNA synthesis, but RNA synthesis inhibition was less outstanding. Mitonafide, compound 1d, and 1i achieved 92%, 94%, and 89% inhibition of 3H-uridine incorporation respectively (Figure 8).","To determine whether compound 1d and 1i could inhibit tumor growth by interfering with nucleic acid synthesis, scientists conducted experiments to investigate their structural similarities to mitonafide.

The untreated cancer cells showed a linear pattern of 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine incorporation over 60 minutes. Nonetheless, upon exposure to the test compounds at an 8 μM concentration, there was a gradual and considerable decline in 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine incorporation comparable to that of mitonafide under the same concentration. After an hour of treatment, compound 1d and 1i were able to inhibit 3H-thymidine incorporation by 96% and 95%, respectively, while mitonafide exposure led to a 95% reduction.

"The significance of the nature and position of a substituent on a molecule's antitumor property has been established in research. This study focused on substituted N-(hydroxyalkyl)naphthalimide and considered five different substituents (R = H, 6-Br, 6-Cl, 6-NO2, 5-NO2) within the aromatic ring portion of the compound. The outcome showed that the antitumor activity was mainly exercised through the 6-NO2 substituent, which is consistent with prior findings on other (chloroalkyl) naphthalimide compounds, where 6-nitro-2-(3-chloropropyl) naphthalimide was the most potent antitumor agent in that series. [7].","The antitumor property of a molecule is dependent on the nature and location of a substituent, according to previous research.

"Compound 1i displayed significant antitumor activity, and it had an impact on the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle in MOLT-4 cells. During the S phase of the cell cycle, a cell prepares for cell division by duplicating its DNA. The results of flow cytometric measurements indicated that compound 1i prevented the S phase, which is essential for DNA duplication in tumor cells before mitosis. In S-180 cells, compound 1i inhibited 3 H-thymidine incorporation into DNA, which confirmed this possibility, evidencing suppression of DNA synthesis. Additionally, compound 1i inhibited 3H-uridine uptake, thereby suppressing RNA synthesis. Thus, the results suggest that its antitumor effect was due to its ability to inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis.","The most outstanding antitumor activity was observed in Compound 1i, which disrupted the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle in MOLT-4 cells. Prior to cell division, DNA duplication takes place during the S phase of the cell cycle. Compound 1i interfered with the S phase as seen through flow cytometric measurement, indicating a direct impact on DNA duplication in tumor cells before mitosis. This possibility was later confirmed in S-180 cells where Compound 1i suppressed DNA synthesis by inhibiting 3 H-thymidine incorporation into the DNA sequence. Further, Compound 1i led to inhibition of RNA synthesis by suppressing 3H-uridine uptake. The combined results suggest that Compound 1i's antitumor effect was mediated through its ability to suppress DNA and RNA synthesis.","Compound 1i possessed the most significant antitumor activity, and it interfered with the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle in MOLT-4 cells. During the S phase of the cell cycle, a cell duplicates its DNA as a prelude to cell division. Flow cytometric measurements revealed that Compound 1i affected the S phase, resulting in a disruption of DNA duplication in tumor cells before mitosis. This possibility was subsequently confirmed in S-180 cells, as Compound 1i inhibited DNA synthesis by impeding the incorporation of 3 H-thymidine into the DNA chain. Moreover, Compound 1i suppressed RNA synthesis by halting 3H-uridine uptake concomitantly. Based on these findings, it appears that Compound 1i's antitumor effect resulted from its capacity to inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis."
"Flow cytometric analysis revealed that MOLT-4 cells treated with compound 1i experienced a delay in exiting G2/M, which is the final phase of the cell cycle. This delay is caused by issues with DNA damage repair, spindle attachment to centromeres, and the polymerization of spindle microtubules, as reported in previous studies. It appears that the compound negatively affects the mitotic apparatus by increasing spindle checkpoint control, resulting in a delayed mitotic exit for daughter cells. Like vinca alkaloids and paclitaxel, which interfere with spindle microtubules to create antitumor effects, compound 1i may operate in a similar manner.","In MOLT-4 cells treated with compound 1i, a delay in exiting the final stage of the cell cycle (G2/M phase) was observed through flow cytometry. This delay typically stems from issues with DNA damage repair, spindle attachment to centromeres, and spindle microtubule polymerization. The compound appears to have an unfavorable effect on the mitotic apparatus, up-regulating spindle checkpoint control and causing a postponement in the mitotic exit of daughter cells. It is suggested that compound 1i functions similarly to antitumor agents such as vinca alkaloids and paclitaxel by triggering changes in spindle microtubules.","According to flow cytometric analysis, MOLT-4 cells treated with compound 1i exhibited a delay in exiting the final stage of the cell cycle, G2/M phase. This delay arises from defects in DNA damage repair, spindle attachment to centromeres, and polymerization of spindle microtubules, which has been reported in past research. The compound appears to have an adverse effect on the mitotic apparatus, causing up-regulation of spindle checkpoint control and leading to a delay in the mitotic exit of daughter cells. Antitumor agents such as vinca alkaloids and paclitaxel act by interfering with spindle microtubules, and compound 1i may be operating in a similar manner."
"The activation of apoptosis, a mechanism of programmed cell death, is a common pathway for several antitumor agents to combat cancer, as stated in source 21. Similarly, Compound 1i has also been shown to exert its antitumor activity through apoptosis. This is evident through the sharp increase in sub-G1 fraction, morphological evidence observed through light and electron microscopic studies, and a significant rise in caspase 3 and 6 levels in treated cells. Apoptosis is coordinated by a range of cell signals that may originate intracellularly from the mitochondria or extracellularly from death receptors located on the cell membrane. These two pathways eventually meet to form an irreversible execution phase mediated by caspase 3 and 6. The intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway and extrinsic or death receptor pathway are possible mechanisms of activating the pro-apoptotic signal elicited by Compound 1i; however, it is not clear which pathway is followed. The ultrastructural study shows mitochondrial cristae damage in treated cells, indicating that the mitochondrial pathway is more inclined. Naphthalimides, including amonafide and its analogs, have previously been reported to induce apoptosis, as illustrated in source 22, 23.","Inducing apoptosis, a programmed cell death mechanism, is a common approach for several antitumor agents to fight cancer, which is mentioned in source 21. Similarly, Compound 1i exhibited its antitumor activity by activating apoptosis. This is confirmed by the increase in sub-G1 fraction, morphological evidence from light and electron microscopic studies, and a significant rise in caspase 3 and 6 levels in treated cells. Different cell signals control apoptosis, which may begin internally through the mitochondria or externally through death receptors located on the cell membrane. These two pathways ultimately converge and produce an irreversible execution stage controlled by caspase 3 and 6. It remains unclear if the pro-apoptotic signal produced by Compound 1i follows the mitochondrial or extrinsic pathway. However, damage to the mitochondrial cristae in treated cells, as observed in the ultrastructural study, supports the mitochondrial pathway. Like the present findings, numerous naphthalimides, such as amonafide and its analogs, have been reported to initiate apoptosis, as per source 22, 23.","The activation of apoptosis, a biomolecular mechanism of programmed cell death, is a common mechanism employed by several antitumor agents to combat cancer, as stated in source 21.

Apoptosis is regulated by a range of cell signals that may arise intracellularly from the mitochondria or extracellularly from death receptors on the cell membrane. These two pathways meet to form an irreversible execution phase mediated by caspase 3 and 6. It remains uncertain whether the pro-apoptotic signal activated by Compound 1i proceeds through the intrinsic (mitochondrial) or extrinsic (death receptor) pathway. Nevertheless, mitochondrial cristae damage was observed in treated cells, as seen from the ultrastructural study, thus implying that Compound 1i indeed activates the mitochondrial pathway. As seen in source 22, 23, the induction of apoptosis by many naphthalimides, such as amonafide and its analogs, is consistent with the present findings."
"The study illustrated that compound 1i displayed significant antitumor activity against murine S-180 tumor cells and various human tumor cell lines in vitro. The mechanism behind this was the inhibition of cell proliferation and an increase in programmed cell death. Notably, the compound didn't indicate any harmful effects towards normal human PBMC, thus showing potential as an antitumor agent in further development.","In summary, the study presented compelling evidence of the remarkable antitumor activity of compound 1i against both murine S-180 tumor cells and various human tumor cell lines in vitro. Such effect resulted from the compound's ability to impede cell proliferation and enhance programmed cell death. The fact that the compound didn't elicit any cytotoxicity on normal human PBMC makes it a promising option for further research as an antitumor agent.","The present study exhibited noteworthy results of the antitumor activity of compound 1i towards murine S-180 tumor cells and a range of human tumor cell lines in vitro by effectively inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting programmed cell death.

Hypofractionation has been found to provide equivalent survival rates to conventional radiotherapy for stage III NSCLC, but without the symptomatic pneumonitis that often proves fatal [3]. Furthermore, the combination of standard-dose erlotinib with chemoradiotherapy does not increase toxicity, making it a feasible option [4].

"Erlotinib, an EGFR TKI, shows effectiveness in treating NSCLC among elderly patients. It can be administered alone in specific advanced NSCLC circumstances with only a 0.8% chance of developing interstitial lung disease. When combined with chemoradiotherapy, standard-dose erlotinib is feasible without increasing the likelihood of harmful side effects. On the other hand, it's important to note that prior tissue injury may impact the response to erlotinib after radiology treatment. Studies suggest that erlotinib can improve radiation reactions and may cause an altered response when administered after radiation, thus enhancing cell cycle arrest, inducing apoptosis, and aiding in DNA repair.","Erlotinib is an effective anti-tumor treatment for NSCLC in elderly patients. It can be used alone in select cases of advanced NSCLC with low occurrences of interstitial lung disease. Combined with chemoradiotherapy, erlotinib does not cause increased toxicities. However, if there is prior tissue damage that resulted from radiation therapy, the cells may have an altered response when treated with erlotinib. Radiosensitizing effects of erlotinib are documented to initiate cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, accelerated cellular repopulation, and DNA damage repair. Consequently, when erlotinib is applied after radiation treatment, cells may exhibit an altered response.","The drug Erlotinib, which is an EGFR TKI, has proven to be an effective agent for treating NSCLC in elderly patients. When administered alone, it can be beneficial in a few select cases of advanced NSCLC without a high possibility of interstitial lung disease. Studies have shown that adding standard dosages of Erlotinib to chemoradiotherapy has been viable without an escalation in associated hazardous effects. However, findings suggest that previous tissue damage from radiation therapy could result in cells with altered responses when the drug is subsequently administered. Research indicates that Erlotinib can expedite cell cycle arrest, induce apoptosis, and repair DNA damage enhancing radiation responses. Consequently, when Erlotinib is given after radiation therapy, it can lead to an altered response in the cells."
"SBRT administered via HT enables the reduction of normal tissue exposure to high levels of radiation. However, while this approach may be beneficial, there is a risk of increased low-dose irradiation to non-target organs that could negatively impact the patient. Recent studies have indicated that arc therapy can amplify the deleterious effects of non-target organ radiation exposure, a phenomenon that can be exacerbated by agents with recall effects. It is also important to note that the administration of anticancer drugs can impact the pharmacokinetics of low-dose irradiation and vice versa, even in off-target regions. Reports have also shown that EGFR inhibitors could enhance both beneficial and adverse effects of radiation. As such, it is critical to exercise caution in prescribing these inhibitors to patients who have undergone radiation therapy.","Although SBRT delivered by HT allows for the reduction of normal tissue exposure to high levels of radiation, there is still the potential for increased low-dose irradiation to non-target organs at risk, leading to the occurrence of lung toxicity. The use of arc therapy may exacerbate this phenomenon due to the low dose bath effect, which could be amplified by other agents that trigger recall effects. Off-target areas could be impacted by anticancer drugs and low-dose irradiation since they modulate each other's pharmacokinetics, potentially leading to unwanted side effects. For example, administration of erlotinib concurrently with radiation has resulted in symptomatic pneumonitis in some NSCLC patients, while others develop radiation recall dermatitis. This suggests that EGFR inhibitors can enhance the beneficial effects and adverse effects of radiation, particularly when given following concurrent treatment with radiation. Furthermore, radiation can also modify the systemic effects of drugs, not just the treatment and side effects.","SBRT combined with HT is a technique that can help to reduce the amount of normal tissue exposure to high levels of radiation. However, there is a possibility of increased non-target organ irradiation at low doses, which can result in lung toxicity. The usage of arc therapy may intensify this situation due to the low dose bath phenomenon, which could be exacerbated by recall effect agents. Low-dose irradiation and anticancer drugs can also affect each other's pharmacokinetics, even in off-target regions, which might lead to undesired side effects. There have been cases in which the administration of EGFR inhibitors has intensified both the beneficial and the harmful effects of radiation, resulting in symptomatic pneumonitis and radiation recall dermatitis in some NSCLC patients. As a result, caution is advised when prescribing EGFR inhibitors to patients who have received concurrent radiation therapy. Moreover, radiation modifies the systemic effects of drugs, possibly causing additional side effects or treatment benefits."

The genus Pestivirus also includes other serious livestock pathogens like bovine viral diarrhea virus and border disease virus. Genetic typing categorizes CSF viruses into three main groups with ten subgroups. Recent phylogenetic analyzes indicate a shift in the virus population from the older groups (1 and 3) to the recent group 2, and this shift has been observed in many European and Asian countries. It is curious to note that, although all live-attenuated vaccine strains belong to group 1, including the subgroup 1.1 Chinese lapinized vaccine strain (C-strain) that has been used for prophylactic vaccination in China since 1954, two independent studies highlight that subgroup 2.1 strains have emerged in China that broke away from the C-strain and became dominant."
"E2 is considered the major envelope glycoprotein present on the surface of the virus particle. Its role in facilitating virus attachment and entry into host cells, as well as determining cell tropism, is vital. This glycoprotein is also designated as a critical virulence determinant. In addition, it can stimulate an immune response resulting in the production of neutralizing antibodies that can provide immunity to pigs. Using monoclonal antibodies, researchers have identified two antigenic units in the N-terminal portion of E2, namely B/C and A/D. Deletion of the C-terminal region has no considerable effect on antibody binding. The antigenic structure of E2 depends on the first six conserved cysteine residues and the motif 771LLFD774.","E2 is a critical envelope glycoprotein located on the surface of the virus particle.

"The genetic diversity of E2 among different groups has undergone extensive study, revealing that the antigenic units could be under positive selection due to continued exposure to high immunologic pressure. The N-terminal half of E2 displays greater variability than the C-terminal half, which suggests that the antigenic units undergo positive selection. Different patterns of reactivity with monoclonal antibodies provide indication of the antigenic variation of E2 among different CSFV isolates. The use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to select mAb-resistant mutants demonstrated that, in most cases, single point mutations could lead to the complete loss of monoclonal antibodies binding. Additionally, the substitution of amino acids at position 710 on the E2 proteins of different strains affected binding and neutralization by a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Studies have shown that single amino acid exchanges between a group 1 vaccine strain LPC and a group 3 field isolate could change the monoclonal antibodies binding pattern entirely. Taken together, variability caused by one or more amino acids within antigenic units may result in the antigenic variation of E2.

The objective of the study was to assess the extent of antigenic variation in glycoprotein E2 antigenic units by raising pig antisera against CSFV vaccine C-strain and a representative subgroup 2.1 strain QZ-07.

"Prokaryotic-derived truncated rE2 proteins have been used for antigen production, identification of antigenic domains, and mapping of epitopes. For this study, two types of truncated rE2 proteins were expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells, namely rE2-BC (aa 690-814) and rE2-AD (aa 690-865). The protein rE2-BC covered the N-terminal 123 residues which are essential for binding to pig anti-CSFV serum, while rE2-AD contained both antigenic units B/C and A/D. Western blotting indicated that the proteins had the correct molecular weights of 20 kDa and 25 kDa, respectively, and reacted strongly with pig anti-C-strain hyperimmune serum. Therefore, these prokaryotic-derived rE2 proteins were found to be suitable for generating monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, as well as for examining antibody binding.","In order to produce antigens, identify antigenic domains, and map epitopes, prokaryotic-derived truncated rE2 proteins have been employed.

"To determine the variation of E2 antigen amid the subgroup 1.1 C-strain and subgroup 2.1 field isolates, researchers assessed the rE2-AD proteins of each strain. They used ELISA to cross-examine these proteins with antisera collected from pigs at different time points after vaccination with the vaccine C-strain or infection with strain QZ-07, which symbolizes subgroup 2.1. The findings, as illustrated in Figure 2, discovered that each antiserum reacted more potently with rE2-AD protein of the homologous strain (used to generate the serum) than that of the heterologous strain. Furthermore, Figure 3 compared the efficacy of the anti-C-strain and anti-QZ-07 sera (obtained at 78 days post-immunization with C-strain and 25 days post-infection with strain QZ-07, respectively) set against rE2AD proteins obtained from C-strain and 8 subgroup 2.1 strains. They set the homologous binding efficiency to 100%, and the results showed that the anti-C-strain serum had significantly less ability to bind to subgroup 2.1 rE2-AD proteins, with less than 60% efficiency. Binding of anti-Q7-07 serum to the C-strain rE2-AD protein was even less efficient, with less than 20% efficiency, and the band was hardly detectable. In contrast, the binding of anti-QZ-07 serum to heterologous subgroup 2.1 proteins varied.","To evaluate the variability of E2 antigens between the C-strain subgroup 1.1 and subgroup 2.1 field isolates, researchers utilized ELISA to cross-examine the respective rE2-AD proteins with porcine serum samples collected at various time intervals following immunization with the vaccine C-strain or infection with strain QZ-07. According to Figure 2, the serum samples reacted more strongly with the rE2-AD protein of the homologous strain (the strain used to prepare the serum) than with that of the heterologous strain. To further compare anti-C-strain and anti-QZ-07 sera binding to rE2AD proteins derived from C-strain and 8 subgroup 2.1 strains, researchers set homologous binding efficiency to 100% and analyzed the results in Figure 3. The outcomes revealed that the anti-C-strain serum had significantly lower efficiency in binding to subgroup 2.1 rE2-AD proteins, with efficiency below 60%. When the anti-Q7-07 serum was measured against the C-strain rE2-AD protein, the binding efficiency was even lower, with efficiency below 20%. Conversely, the binding efficiency of anti-QZ-07 serum to the heterologous subgroup 2.1 proteins varied.","To assess the differences in E2 antigenic variation between the subgroup 1.1 C-strain and subgroup 2.1 field isolates, researchers conducted ELISA analysis of rE2-AD proteins cross-examined with antisera collected at different time points from pigs immunized with the vaccine C-strain or infected with strain QZ-07, which represents subgroup 2.1. The researchers observed that each antiserum had a considerably stronger response to the rE2-AD protein of the homologous strain (the strain used to create the serum) than the heterologous strain.

Researchers set the homologous binding efficiency to 100%, and the data showed that the binding efficiency of the anti-C-strain serum to subgroup 2.1 rE2-AD proteins was significantly low, with less than 60% efficiency. In contrast, the binding efficiency of anti-QZ-07 serum to the heterologous subgroup 2.1 proteins was found to be variable. Interestingly, the ability of the anti-QZ-07 serum to bind to C-strain rE2-AD proteins was weak, with an efficiency below 20%, and the band on the blot was barely visible."
"The effectiveness of heterologous neutralization, demonstrated through a two-way neutralization analysis using the pig antiCSFV sera, was found to be lower with sera collected at the early days following vaccination or infection (Figure 4). Additionally, the efficiency of neutralization was observed to vary between the QZ-07 and HZ1-08 strains in subgroup 2.1. This variation is related to the ability of antisera to neutralize heterologous viruses which led the researchers to investigate whether the variation in glycoprotein E2 affects CSFV cross-neutralization. To investigate further, the researchers raised a rabbit antiserum and three monoclonal antibodies against C-strain rE2-AD protein. The rabbit antiserum showed less effective neutralization of the QZ-07 virus as compared to the C-strain. Furthermore, mAbs 1E7 and 6B8 showed no reactivity to E2 upon substitution of cysteine residues in antigenic unit B/C with serine residues, but no effect was observed in the reactivity of mAb 2B6. The results indicate that mAbs 1E7 and 6B8 are binding to conformational epitopes which involve cysteine residues in E2's structural conformation. However, the neutralization efficiency of mAb 2B6 was low even though it only bound to C-strain. (Table 2).","The researchers found that heterologous neutralization was less effective, especially with sera collected at the early days following vaccination or infection, in a two-way neutralization analysis using pig antiCSFV sera (Figure 4). They also observed differences in the efficiency of neutralization between the QZ-07 and HZ1-08 strains in subgroup 2.1, which is influenced by variation in strains. This led the researchers to investigate whether variation in glycoprotein E2 affects CSFV cross-neutralization. To explore this further, the researchers developed a rabbit antiserum and three monoclonal antibodies against C-strain rE2-AD protein. The rabbit antiserum showed less efficient neutralization of the QZ-07 virus than the C-strain. Interestingly, mutagenesis of cysteine residues in antigenic unit B/C affected the reactivity of mAbs 1E7 and 6B8, but had no effect on mAb 2B6. These results suggest that cysteine residues are involved in E2's structural conformation, and that mAbs 1E7 and 6B8 are binding to conformational epitopes. Additionally, the neutralization efficiency of mAb 2B6 was low, although it only bound to C-strain (Table 2).","Through a two-way neutralization analysis using pig antiCSFV sera, the researchers found that heterologous neutralization was less effective, particularly with sera collected in the early days following vaccination or infection (Figure 4).

To examine this more closely, a rabbit antiserum and three monoclonal antibodies against C-strain rE2-AD protein were cultivated by the researchers. The rabbit antiserum displayed lower neutralization efficiency for the QZ-07 virus in comparison to the C-strain. Furthermore, the substitution of cysteine residues in antigenic unit B/C with serine residues abolished reactivity of mAbs 1E7 and 6B8 to E2, without affecting the reactivity of mAb 2B6. These findings indicate that the cysteine residues in E2 play a role in its structural conformation and that mAbs 1E7 and 6B8 recognize conformational epitopes. However, the neutralization efficiency of mAb 2B6 was low despite its binding only to C-strain (Table 2)."
"E2 sequences of 108 representative CSFV strains from each group were aligned to identify the amino acid residues responsible for the observed antigenic variation.

"Through site-directed mutagenesis, we substituted amino acids in C-strain E2 protein with those present at the same positions in subgroup 2.1 proteins, as listed in Table 3, second to last row.

"To delve deeper into the antigenic and genetic evolution of the antigenic units, an analysis of codon and amino acid diversity was conducted using a variant of Simpson's index.

Meanwhile, the six cysteine residues and the residues located in the 771LLFD774 motif have high conservation even though their codons have undergone a moderate number of synonymous mutations.

"CSFV can be divided into three main groups based on its phylogeny.

"The findings from the study revealed that the pig anti-C-strain and anti-QZ07 sera were observed to have a reduced binding efficiency with heterologous rE2-AD proteins in comparison to their homologous proteins. It was suggested from this that there might be antigenic differences. The E2 protein of the vaccine C-strain was also found to be antigenically different from the wide range of subgroup 2.1 strains, indicating antigenic variation. This difference was also observed in other subgroup 2.1 strains. Moreover, the study further confirmed that the previously reported differences in antigenicity identified using mouse mAbs also occur in the context of pig anti-CSFV sera.","The study's data indicates that both pig anti-C-strain and anti-QZ07 sera bound heterologous rE2-AD proteins with less than 60% efficiency when compared to homologous proteins. The lower binding efficiency suggests the presence of antigenic differences between the proteins. Additionally, it was found that the E2 protein of the C-strain vaccine is antigenically distinct from those of different subgroup 2.1 strains. The inefficiency of the pig anti-QZ-07 serum to bind HZ1-08 and QZ2-06 derived rE2-AD proteins also points towards the presence of antigenic variation among subgroup 2.1 strains. The study further establishes that the differences in antigenicity detected through mouse mAbs also apply to pig anti-CSFV sera.","According to the study's data, the pig anti-C-strain and anti-QZ07 sera had a binding efficiency of less than 60% with heterologous rE2-AD proteins compared to homologous proteins, which suggests that the proteins may have antigenic differences.

"Based on the results of neutralization experiments, we assessed the correlation between the efficiency of antibody binding to rE2 proteins and the ability of the antibody to block CSFV infection.

The findings suggest that the differential expression of antigenic epitopes on the E2 glycoproteins of CSFV strains may explain why subgroup 2.1 CSFV strains persist in China despite the widespread use of the C-strain vaccine. Antibody selection is also thought to play a role in the shift of viral populations from group 1 to 2."
"Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce amino acid substitutions in C-strain rE2 proteins in order to determine if variable residues (listed in Table 3) contribute to antigenic variation in subgroup 2.1 strains. Unlike mutations in the antigenic motif 771LLFD774, which disrupted E2 protein structural integrity, no significant effect on binding to anti-C-strain serum was seen for any of the substitutions, indicating that the protein was not grossly misfolded and the substituted residues may not be crucial for glycoprotein E2's overall structural stability. However, 13 of the 20 substitutions did enhance binding of the variant C-strain rE2 proteins to anti-QZ-07 serum. Residue 713E was a common antigenic determinant for groups 2 and 3, and was most significantly increased by the GtoE substitution at aa position 713. This is in line with recent findings of Chang et al. that 713E and 729D are critical for specificity of a group 3.4 field strain rE2 protein to mAbs.","To investigate whether variable residues (listed in Table 3) contribute to antigenic variation in subgroup 2.1 strains, we employed site-directed mutagenesis in introducing amino acid substitutions in the C-strain rE2 proteins. Notably, while mutations in the antigenic motif 771LLFD774 led to a disruption of E2 protein structural integrity, none of the substitutions exhibited a significant effect on binding to anti-C-strain serum, which suggests that the substituted residues may not be critical for the overall structural stability of glycoprotein E2. Contrarily, substitution of 13 out of the 20 residues resulted in an enhancement in binding of the variant C-strain rE2 proteins to anti-QZ-07 serum. Sequence alignment revealed that residue 713E is a common antigenic determinant for groups 2 and 3, while all vaccine strains possess 713G. Moreover, the GtoE substitution at aa position 713 caused an evident increase in binding, which is in line with a recent report by Chang et al. on the importance of residues 713E and 729D in the specificity of a group 3.4 field strain rE2 protein to mAbs.","The C-strain rE2 proteins were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to determine whether variable residues (listed in Table 3) contribute to the observed antigenic variation in subgroup 2.1 strains. Unlike mutations located in the antigenic motif 771LLFD774, which led to a disruption of E2 protein structural integrity, the substitutions in the protein's variable residues did not show a significant effect on binding to anti-C-strain serum. This implies that the substituted residues may not be critical for the protein's overall structural stability. However, out of the 20 residues, 13 substitutions resulted in the enhanced binding of the variant C-strain rE2 proteins to anti-QZ-07 serum. Sequence alignment showed that residue 713E is a common antigenic determinant for groups 2 and 3, while all vaccine strains have 713G. Additionally, the GtoE substitution at aa position 713 led to a remarkable increase in binding, which is consistent with recent findings by Chang et al. on the importance of residues 713E and 729D in the specificity of a group 3.4 field strain rE2 protein to mAbs."
"Based on our study, it was found that residue 729D did enhance the binding to pig anti-QZ-07 serum, but it was residues 705N, 709P, 723S, and 779A that contributed significantly more to the binding process (as shown in Figure 5A). It is noteworthy that these same residues are also present in the E2 proteins of both subgroup 2.1 and subgroup 3.4 strains, which indicates that these two residues may also be important for antigenicity of subgroup 3.4 glycoprotein E2 when tested with pig antisera against group 3 strains. The use of polyclonal sera collected from pigs that were either infected with a field strain or immunized with C-strain resulted in a broader range of immunization- or infection-induced antibodies. This is why the polyclonal sera were able to identify more residues that contribute to the antigenic variation of glycoprotein E2 as compared to mouse monoclonal antibodies (as described in [35]). In addition, pairing the polyclonal antisera against group 1 C-strain and a representative group 2 field strain provided an additional advantage over mAbs, allowing us to better probe the residues involved in antigenic variation between the two groups.","Our research showed that while residue 729D was able to increase binding to pig anti-QZ-07 serum, residues 705N, 709P, 723S, and 779A had a far greater effect (Figure 5A). Interestingly, these very same residues can also be found at positions 705 and 723 on E2 proteins of strains in both subgroup 2.1 and subgroup 3.4, suggesting that these residues might contribute significantly to the antigenicity of subgroup 3.4 glycoprotein E2 in the presence of pig antisera against group 3 strains. In contrast to mouse mAbs, the use of polyclonal sera from pigs that were immunized with the C-strain or infected with a field strain provided a comprehensive range of immunization- or infection-induced antibodies in our study. The broad response of the polyclonal sera allowed us to identify more residues involved in antigenic variation of glycoprotein E2. Additionally, the polyclonal antisera against group 1 C-strain, when paired with a representative group 2 field strain, helped us explore the residues that mediate antigenic variation between the two groups, which is a further advantage over mAbs.","Our investigation found that although residue 729D increased the binding to pig anti-QZ-07 serum, residues 705N, 709P, 723S, and 779A made a much larger contribution (as demonstrated in Figure 5A). It is worth noting that these same residues are present at positions 705 and 723 on E2 proteins of both subgroup 2.1 and subgroup 3.4 strains, implying that these two residues could also play an essential role in the antigenicity of subgroup 3.4 glycoprotein E2 if tested with pig antisera against group 3 strains. We used polyclonal sera obtained from pigs that were infected with a field strain or immunized with C-strain, resulting in a complete range of immunization- or infection-induced antibodies, unlike mouse mAbs. This is why these polyclonal sera were more effective at identifying residues responsible for glycoprotein E2 antigenic variation. Moreover, matching polyclonal antisera against group 1 C-strain with a representative group 2 field strain enabled us to detect the residues accountable for antigenic variation between the two groups, providing an additional advantage over mAbs."
"The results of the site-directed mutagenesis analysis (Figure 5A) indicate that there is expected antigenic variation among the subgroup 2.1 strains, as each of the 8 strains studied has unique strain-specific substitutions (data not shown). The most significant impact on binding appears to be the C737R substitution in the antigenic units of strain QZ2-06, which can be explained by the importance of the cysteine residue at that position for the protein's antigenic structure. It is believed that the antigenic variation between strain HZ1-08 and the reference subgroup 2.1 strain QZ-07 is likely determined by the E782V substitution in strain HZ1-08.","The site-directed mutagenesis analysis (Figure 5A) reveals that the antigenic variation observed among subgroup 2.1 strains is unsurprising, given that each of the 8 strains analyzed in this study has unique strain-specific substitutions (data not shown). The substitution of C737R in strain QZ2-06, which affects binding the most, can be attributed to the critical role of the cysteine residue at this position in the antigenic structure of the protein. It is postulated that the primary factor leading to antigenic variation between the reference subgroup 2.1 strain QZ-07 and strain HZ1-08 is the E782V substitution in strain HZ1-08.","The data obtained from the site-directed mutagenesis analysis (Figure 5A) demonstrates that the presence of antigenic variation in subgroup 2.1 strains is not unexpected, as each of the 8 strains examined in this study shows unique strain-specific substitutions (data not shown). The most significant impact of these substitutions on binding is manifested in the C737R substitution in strain QZ2-06, which is critical for maintaining the antigenic structure of the protein. It is hypothesized that the E782V substitution in strain HZ1-08 is the key element responsible for antigenic variation between this strain and the reference subgroup 2.1 strain, QZ-07."
"The E2 protein has been found to contain three antigenic regions at amino acid positions 702-731, 774-799 and 841-864, as indicated in Figure 1A. The primary driver of antigenic variation appears to be the 702-731 region, which contains several antigenic residues identified through epitope mapping and substitutions with increased binding to anti-QZ-07 serum. The region 774-799 also contributes to E2 antigenicity, containing a conserved antigenic motif (771LLFD774) and a linear epitope (772LFDGTNP778). Furthermore, substitutions at positions N777S, S779A, and T780I within this region have been found to enhance binding to anti-QZ-07 serum, suggesting multiple functions for this region in shaping the overall antigenicity of E2 protein.","In the E2 protein, three separate regions of antigenicity have been identified within amino acid positions 702-731, 774-799, and 841-864. Figure 1A displays these regions clearly. The area from 702-731 is the primary cause of antigenic variation, as discovery of antigenic residues through mAb-resistant mutants analysis and epitope mapping has identified. Additionally, substitutions in this area have resulted in a significant increase in the variant rE2 protein's binding ability to anti-QZ-07 serum. The region from 774-799 contains an important antigenic motif (771LLFD774) and a conserved linear epitope (772LFDGTNP778), contributing to the integrity of the E2 antigenic structure. Based on further research, substitutions of N777S, S779A, and T780I within this region have increased binding to anti-QZ-07 serum, indicating that the 774-799 region has multiple roles in shaping the overall antigenicity of E2 protein.","The E2 protein has been mapped to reveal three distinct antigenic regions located at amino acid positions 702-731, 774-799, and 841-864. As depicted in Figure 1A, these regions play a critical role in determining the protein's antigenicity. Evidence suggests that the 702-731 region significantly impacts antigenic variation through the clustering of antibody-resistant mutants and epitopes. Additionally, substitutions in this area have resulted in a significant increase in binding for variant rE2 proteins to anti-QZ-07 serum. The 774-799 region contains a conserved antigenic motif (771LLFD774) and a conserved linear epitope (772LFDGTNP778), both of which maintain the overall integrity of the E2 antigenic structure. Furthermore, research has shown that substitution in this region at positions N777S, S779A, and T780I enhances binding to anti-QZ-07 serum, suggesting that it has a significant role in shaping the antigenicity of the E2 protein."
"We examined E2 sequences of CSFV to compare the diversity of codons and amino acids concerning antigenic evolution. To measure this diversity, we used a Simpson's index variant previously applied to influenza virus hemagglutinin glycoprotein to quantify amino acid and codon diversity in the antigenic epitopes. We discovered that the diversity of each amino acid residue implicated in antigenic variation was equal to the corresponding codon's diversity, indicating an astonishing association between antigenic and genetic evolution concerning the antigenic units of glycoprotein E2 in nature. Nevertheless, antigenic residues identified in mAb-resistant mutants showed random diversification, possibly suggesting that in vitro selection can't explain the natural selection in pigs. CSFV may use co-diversification of codons and amino acids implicated with antigenic variation in field strains to evade the immune system under immune pressure and extensive vaccination.","Our analysis involved E2 genetic sequences of CSFV with the primary aim of contrasting codon and amino acid diversification relative to antigenic evolution. To achieve this comparison, we made use of a modified Simpson's index suitable for gauging amino acid and codon diversity in the influenza virus hemagglutinin glycoprotein epitopes. We found that as far as each of the thirteen amino acid residues were concerned, antigenic diversification mirrored an equivalent degree of diversification in codons. This observation provides compelling evidence of a significant correlation between genetic and antigenic evolution within the glycoprotein E2 antigenic units in real-life situations. In contrast, the various antigenic residues that the mutant monoclonal antibody identified tended to diversify randomly (as illustrated in Figure 6), suggesting that in vitro selection might not sufficiently explain natural selection in pigs. As part of its defense mechanism under immune pressure resulting from extensive vaccination, CSFV could use the co-diversification of both codons and amino acids implicated in antigenic variation within field strains.","Our investigation focused on analyzing the E2 sequences of CSFV to compare antigenic evolution's amino acid and codon variability. We utilized a modified variant of the Simpson's index previously designed to measure codon and amino acid diversity of the antigenic epitopes of influenza virus hemagglutinin glycoprotein. Our study showed that there was a perfect match between the diversity of every one of the thirteen amino acid residues involved in the antigenic variations and their corresponding codon diversity. This suggests a strong correlation exists between genetic and antigenic evolution within the E2 glycoprotein antigenic units in nature. On the other hand, antigenic residues identified through mAb-resistant mutants analysis were found to diversify randomly. This observation suggests that in vitro selection may not be a useful predictor of natural selection in pigs. Consequently, co-diversification of codons and amino acids involved in antigenic variation in field strains of CSFV may be employed as one of the immune evasion mechanisms under immune pressure and extensive vaccination."
"The study has shown that the glycoprotein E2 of CSFV can undergo antigenic variation between the vaccine C-strain and the group 2 field strains, as well as within the current group 2 strains found in China. The primary determinants of this variation are the substitutions in the first region of the three identified areas, specifically aa 702-731. These substitutions can have an impact on the cross-neutralization of CSFV. To verify if these residues contribute to the differences in neutralization observed, further work is needed. The results obtained from this research may offer valuable information in developing CSF vaccines that have a better immune response and efficacy, and differential serological assays.","The report has revealed that the glycoprotein E2 of CSFV undergoes antigenic variation when compared between the vaccine C-strain and the group 2 field strains, as well as within the group 2 strains found in China currently. The main determinant is the substitutions found in the first region, which corresponds to aa 702-731 out of the three regions identified in the study. These substitutions affect the cross-neutralization of CSFV. Further investigation is mandatory to understand whether these residues contribute to the variations in neutralization observed. The outcome of this research can assist in creating differential serological assays and CSF vaccines with better immunogenicity and efficacy.","The research demonstrates the antigenic variation of CSFV glycoprotein E2 in the current group 2 strains circulating in China and between these strains and the vaccine C-strain. The primary driver of this variation has been identified as substitutions within the first of three discrete regions associated with antigenic variation, namely, aa 702-731. The variation in glycoprotein E2 has implications on CSFV cross-neutralization. Further work is needed to determine whether these antigenic residues contribute to the observed differences in neutralization. The findings of this study can aid in the development of novel CSF vaccines with enhanced immunogenicity and efficacy, as well as differential serological assays."

Throughout this entire process, animal welfare was of utmost importance, and experiments with animals were authorized by Zhejiang University's Laboratory Animal Management Committee.","The production of monoclonal antibodies targeting the rE2-AD protein of C-strain involved a series of steps. Firstly, four 5-week-old female specific-pathogen-free BALB/c mice were immunized with 0.1 mg of purified rE2-AD protein of vaccine C-strain emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant through subcutaneous injection. The mice subsequently received two intraperitoneal boosts of the protein, emulsified in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant at 2-week intervals. Following the final boost, the mice were euthanized and their spleen cells harvested. SP2/0 myeloma cells were then fused with the harvested splenocytes using polyethylene glycol.

"To investigate the impact of BMI on breast cancer risk in women of different menopausal status, we analyzed data separately for women aged below 55 years (considered premenopausal) and those aged 55 years and above (postmenopausal). This was because BMI has been shown to have different associations with breast cancer risk in these two groups of women. We used logistic regression models that adjusted for appropriate risk factors and included dummy variables to estimate the per-allele odds ratios (ORs) for SNPs. We did not present estimates obtained using a younger age limit (50 years) as these were similar to those obtained using the age categories as surrogates for pre- and post-menopausal status.","The study examined the relationship between BMI and breast cancer risk in women based on their menopausal status. The analysis was conducted separately for women aged below 55 years (premenopausal) and those aged 55 years and above (postmenopausal) as BMI has different associations with breast cancer risk in these two groups. To estimate the per-allele odds ratios (ORs) for SNPs that affect breast cancer risk, the logistic regression models were adjusted for appropriate risk factors and included dummy variables. The findings using a younger age limit of 50 years to determine the premenopausal status surrogate showed similar results to those using the age categories; as such, those results were not presented.","The study aimed to investigate the impact of BMI on breast cancer risk in women based on their menopausal status.

Estimates of per-allele odds ratios (ORs) for SNPs associated with breast cancer risk were obtained using logistic regression models that took into account relevant risk factors and included dummy variables. The analysis using a younger age limit of 50 years to classify the premenopausal status surrogate yielded similar results to those obtained using age categories and was, therefore, not presented."
"The study employed logistic regression models to determine if there was an interaction or modification of genetic associations caused by other risk factors. The models included dummy variables for the study and three parameters: one for the main per-risk-allele impact, one for the chief risk factor impact (with all modeled as continuous variables, except for ever having had a live birth), and one for the interaction term which combined the number of risk alleles and the risk factor's value. The addition of the interaction term was tested statistically by comparing the model with the interaction term to the model without using a likelihood ratio test. Lastly, the study analyzed the effect modification caused by BMI for women, categorized into those who were younger than 55 and those who were 55 years and older, with separate evaluations conducted for each age group.","Logistic regression models were utilized in the study to examine whether there was an interaction or modification of genetic associations by other risk factors.

The statistical significance of the interaction term was determined using a likelihood ratio test to compare the model with and without the interaction term. In addition, the study assessed the effect modification caused by BMI separately for women who were younger than 55 and those who were 55 years or older.","To assess whether there was an interaction or modification of genetic associations by other risk factors, the study employed logistic regression models.

"The team utilized a parametric bootstrap test to calculate interaction P-values adjusted for multiple testing. They estimated the chance of each subject being a case for every one of the 72 interactions tested based on a logistic regression model that took into account only main effects. Specifically, study (categorical), SNP (per-allele), and risk factor (continuous, except ever having had a live birth) were considered. The parametric bootstrap comprised generating a dummy case-control status for each subject and fitting the interaction model as mentioned above, based on actual data for all other variables.

"The risk factors for breast cancer were analyzed in population-based studies, and most of the expected associations were observed, except for one.

"There is evidence to suggest that the association between 11p15-rs3817198 (LSP1) and breast cancer risk may be influenced by the number of live births a woman has had, with a stronger effect observed among those who have had four or more live births.

"The evidence for effect modification was strongest for the number of live births and a specific gene variant called 11p15-rs3817198 (LSP1). Nevertheless, the increase in relative risk that correlates with an increased parity did not have any statistical significance after taking multiple testing into account. It's worth mentioning that the interaction odds ratio (OR) was just 1.05 per allele and live birth, resulting in an estimated per-allele OR increase from 1.04 in women with only one child to 1.24 in women with four or more kids, for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with an average OR of 1.08 in various parity levels. Since the weak interactions found here would only make a negligible difference in joint effects estimates compared to models assuming multiplicative effects, this finding emphasizes the difficulty of identifying modifying effects of this magnitude in massive studies.","The study's strongest evidence of effect modification was seen in the correlation between the number of live births and the 11p15-rs3817198 (LSP1) gene variant. However, the increase in relative risk with increased parity did not have statistical significance after multiple testing corrections. It is essential to note the interaction odds ratio (OR) of just 1.05 per allele and per live birth. Consequently, the per-allele OR had only a minor increase of 1.04 for women with a single child to 1.24 in women with four or more children for an estimated average OR of 1.08 across all parity levels for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The study's weak interactions would have resulted in only minimal differences in joint effects estimates compared to models where multiplicative effects are assumed. This finding demonstrates the challenge of identifying the modifying effects of this contingent in enormous studies.","The study found the strongest evidence of effect modification for the number of live births and the 11p15-rs3817198 (LSP1) gene variant. However, the increase in relative risk associated with higher parity was not statistically significant after accounting for multiple testing. Notably, the interaction odds ratio (OR) was only 1.05 per allele and per live birth. This resulted in a minor increase in the per-allele OR, rising from 1.04 in women with one child to 1.24 in women with four or more children. For the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which had an average OR of 1.08 across all parity levels, these weak interactions would only have slight differences in joint effects estimates relative to models that assume multiplicative effects.

"One of the major strengths of the BCAC is its ability to achieve a large combined sample size via international collaborations. This has been very effective in confirming or rejecting the relationship between common SNPs identified through GWAS and candidate gene studies and breast cancer. The consortium is also capable of providing highly precise estimates of the ORs related to susceptibility alleles with noticeable consistency, even with the range of study designs included by different studies. However, the representation of multiple studies that employed volunteered controls or selected cases can affect the assessment of some risk factors' primary effects across the whole consortium. But this selection bias doesn't affect the evaluation of interactions. Nonetheless, we analyzed the data from only population-based studies and studies with at least 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls in sensitivity analyses which generated similar results concerning interactions.","The BCAC's primary positive attribute is its substantial combined sample size achieved through international cooperation. This has proven to be exceptionally successful in confirming or rejecting the association of common SNPs identified through GWAS and candidate gene studies and breast cancer. The consortium has also provided precise estimates of ORs related to susceptibility alleles, characterized by remarkable consistency, despite the variety of study designs used among the participating members. However, due to the multiple studies' representation, which recruited volunteered controls or selected cases, it's not possible to achieve an appropriate evaluation of some risk factors' primary effects across the entire consortium. Nonetheless, this selection bias doesn't influence the interaction assessment. In light of this, we conducted sensitivity analyses that included only data from population-based studies and studies with at least 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls. The results obtained in terms of interactions remain consistent.","The BCAC's significant strength is its vast sample size, obtained through international collaborations.

The consortium can provide highly precise estimates of ORs associated with susceptibility alleles, with consistency observed between the various studies, despite the different study designs utilized. However, because many studies recruited selected cases and/or volunteer controls, evaluating the primary effects of some risk factors across the consortium may not be appropriate. Despite the potential selection bias, this does not impact the assessment of interactions in any way. Nonetheless, we conducted sensitivity analyses that included only data from population-based studies and studies with a minimum of 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls. Interestingly, the results obtained regarding interactions remain largely unchanged."
"The heterogeneity in data collection methods across studies is one of the potential limitations of our study. Structured questionnaires were used in all studies except for two that were not population-based, and these questionnaires were administered using various methods such as in-person interviews, phone interviews, and self-administration. Although some variations in data collection methods may have impacted our findings on BMI, other factors such as age at menarche, number of live births, age at first birth, and ever having had a live birth are expected to be reliable despite these differences. To mitigate any systematic bias, we standardized measurements within studies and adjusted for study as a covariate. We also conducted further analyses by excluding cases that were interviewed before, or more than two years after their breast cancer diagnosis, and the results did not significantly differ. However, one of the limitations of our study was the lack of information on hormone therapy use in the majority of participating studies, which precluded any evaluation of interactions between SNPs and BMI in older women.","One possible drawback of our study is the heterogeneous data collection techniques used across studies. All studies utilized structured questionnaires, but only two studies (which were not population-based) did not administer them via self-administration, in-person interviews or phone interviews. Despite this variation in data collection, our evaluations of age at menarche, age at first birth, number of live births, and ever having had a live birth are deemed to be robust. However, BMI results are more prone to be affected because of inconsistent data collection techniques. Still, we have taken steps to minimize any potential shortcomings by measuring standardized data within studies and controlling for study status as a covariate, reducing any systematic bias to a higher loss of power. In addition, we also performed our key analyses again, ignoring examples where patients were assessed before, or more than two years after their diagnosis of breast cancer, and the outcomes did not vary significantly. Regrettably, we were unable to collect data on hormone therapy (HT) use from most of the participating studies and, as a result, could not evaluate interactions between SNPs and BMI by HT use in older women.","The heterogeneity in data collection methods is a potential limitation of our study. All studies except for two, neither of which were population-based, used structured questionnaires that were administered in various ways such as in-person interviews, phone interviews, and self-administration. Although we found some inconsistencies in data collection methods that might have affected our BMI results, the measures of age at menarche, ever having had a live birth, number of live births, and age at first birth are assumed to be robust. We have tried to address this limitation by standardizing measurements within studies and adjusting the study as a covariate to decrease potential systematic bias to a lower extent of power loss. We also repeated our primary analyses by excluding examples in which patients were assessed before, or more than two years after, their diagnosis of breast cancer, and we did not observe any meaningful differences. A further limitation of this study is that we did not collate information on hormone therapy (HT) use from the majority of participating studies, and therefore we could not analyze interactions between SNPs and BMI by HT use in older women."
"The study conducted the largest collaborative analyses of gene-environment interactions to date and did not find any conclusive evidence of a modification of per-allele relative risk regarding common breast cancer susceptibility variants by age at menarche, parity, age at first birth, or BMI. Results of the study were consistent with a recent smaller prospective study, suggesting that the combined effects of these common susceptibility alleles and other established risk factors could be assumed to be multiplicative in risk predicted models for breast cancer.","The research conducted the most extensive collaborations in analyzing gene-environment interactions, and the results did not indicate any definitive proof for the modification of per-allele relative risk caused by common breast cancer susceptibility variants by BMI, age at menarche, parity, or age at first birth.

This implies that the combinational effects of common susceptibility alleles with other well-known risk factors may be viewed as multiplicative in risk models meant to predict the occurrence of breast cancer.","The study carried out the largest collaborative analyses of gene-environment interactions to date and found no conclusive evidence of per-allele relative risk modification linked to common breast cancer susceptibility variants by age at menarche, parity, age at first birth or BMI.

"Anopheles funestus plays a significant role in the transmission of malaria in southern Africa. According to early research, Plasmodium falciparum parasite rates were as high as 22% in South Africa [1], primarily transmitted by this mosquito species.

"An extensive indoor residual spraying campaign with DDT was carried out in the 1950s in South Africa, leading to the eradication of An. funestus. Over the next half-century, this species was recorded just once during a small malaria outbreak in the country's northern region. However, in 1999/2000, South Africa experienced its worst malaria epidemic since the implementation of IRS in the 1950s, and An. funestus was once again found in northern KwaZulu/Natal, just south of Mozambique. The mosquitoes were found to be resistant to both pyrethroids and carbamates, and they had a 5.4 per cent P. falciparum parasite rate.","Back in the 1950s, South Africa launched an intensive indoor residual spraying campaign that utilized DDT to eliminate An. funestus.

"Based on subsequent studies carried out in the southern region of Mozambique, it was discovered that the group of An. funestus that has developed insecticide resistance has a larger population located to the north of the capital city named Maputo [7-9]. Recently, research revealed that An. funestus specimens collected from Chokwe [10], which is roughly 200 kilometers north of the capital, equally demonstrated insecticidal resistance, even though formerly, this population was assumed to be susceptible according to previous studies [8].","After conducting subsequent research in the Southern Mozambique area, it was determined that the group of An. funestus populations that have developed insecticide resistance has a geographic range that extends beyond the boundaries of the capital city, Maputo [7-9].

"A mosquito surveillance initiative was conducted in Likoma Island, located in Lake Malawi (12°04’S, 34°44’E) during May 2010 (Figure 1). The island is comprised of several high points, with inhabitants living in separated homesteads and occupied mostly with fishing and subsistence farming.

"One field study analyzed the resistance of 111 An. funestus females with an unknown age to insecticides. No temperature or humidity regulation was implemented during the experimentation.

"A total of 223 An. funestus mosquitos underwent DNA tests, which encompassed all wild adults employed in the susceptibility experiments (n = 111) and the captive females that were brought to the lab to lay eggs (n = 112). Nearly all of the mosquitos, about 97.3%, were accurately identified as An. funestus s.s.

"The outcomes of the primary insecticide susceptibility tests performed on the island using An. funestus were presented in Table 1. The female mosquitoes were not of a known age. The results showed that there was a rate of >5% mortality in controls; hence, the findings were corrected using Abbott's formula [14]. As a result, the mortality rates of 77.8% in deltamethrin and 56.4% in bendiocarb were obtained. Furthermore, the effectiveness of field papers was tested in the laboratory using a susceptible An. gambiae colony.

"In the laboratory, An. funestus females aged 1-5 days were utilized for the second round of insecticide susceptibility testing.

The team tested nine different insecticides from all four categories and tabulated the results in Table 2 for easy reference."
The sample size of An. arabiensis female specimens that were bred from larvae was too insufficient (with n = 42) to carry out susceptibility tests in a meaningful manner.,"Due to the limited number of An. arabiensis females that were reared from larvae (n = 42), it was not possible to conduct susceptibility tests in a significant manner.",It was not feasible to carry out susceptibility tests in a meaningful way due to the small sample size of An. arabiensis female specimens bred from larvae (n = 42).
"The susceptibility tests for deltamethrin showed a significant difference between the wild females captured in the field and the 1-5 day old laboratory reared F-1 progeny (p<0.005). This difference could be attributed to two factors. Firstly, high temperatures could have resulted in the high mortality rate of mosquitoes exposed to insecticides. Secondly, An. funestus may have age-dependent susceptibility to the sub-class of pyrethroids. As the survey was conducted in May, which is towards the end of the transmission season, aging female mosquitoes in the field were more susceptible to insecticides. It is noteworthy that even though female mosquitoes tended to age, the female mosquitoes that had fed and mated did not show a decrease in resistance over time.","The observed disparity in deltamethrin susceptibility between wild females from the field and 1-5 day old F-1 progeny raised in the laboratory (p < 0.005) can be explained in two ways. Firstly, high temperatures can affect the survival of mosquitoes when they are exposed to insecticides, and this could be responsible for the high mortality rates that were observed in the field samples. Secondly, it is possible that the susceptibility of An. funestus to this type of pyrethroids may vary depending on the age of the mosquito. As the research was conducted towards the end of the transmission season in May, it is highly likely that the wild-caught female mosquitoes tested in the field were older, which explains their higher susceptibility to insecticides. However, earlier research by Hunt et al. suggests that females that have mated and fed on blood do not exhibit a decrease in resistance over time, which suggests that while the tested wild populations might be aging, they would have all taken numerous blood meals and be mated.","The deltamethrin susceptibility tests conducted on wild female mosquitoes from the field and laboratory-reared 1-5 day old F-1 progeny (p<0.005) yielded a significant difference, which can be attributed to two causes. One reason is that mosquitoes' exposure to insecticides at high temperatures can influence their survival rates [15], which may, in turn, result in the high mortality rate seen in the field samples. Secondly, the sub-class of pyrethroids, to which An. funestus is susceptible, could be age-dependent [16]. Since the survey was completed at the end of the transmission season in May, the aging wild-caught female mosquitoes in the field would have been more receptive to insecticides. As a point of note, Hunt et al. [16] found that mated and blood-fed female mosquitoes did not experience any weakening of resistance over time, implying that aging wild populations would be mated and have had multiple blood meals."
"It is apparent from the susceptibility results that a resistance management plan needs to be created and put into operation to manage malaria on Likoma Island. If there is a wide distribution of pyrethroid treated bed nets on the island, simultaneous IRS with an organophosphate or DDT must be performed to control resistance. Carbamates cannot be utilized as frequently, as there are high rates of survival. However, An. funestus is fully responsive to DDT, providing an opportunity to employ DDT for IRS, possibly in rotation with one of the organophosphates.","The susceptibility findings indicate that a resistance management strategy must be developed and implemented to manage malaria on Likoma Island. If there is extensive distribution of pyrethroid treated bed nets on the island, concomitant IRS must be carried out with an organophosphate or DDT to manage resistance. As there are high survival rates, carbamates are not a feasible option. However, An. funestus is entirely susceptible to DDT, which raises the possibility of using DDT for IRS, perhaps in a rotation with one of the organophosphates.","Based on the susceptibility results, it is evident that a resistance management strategy is indispensable to controlling malaria on Likoma Island. For effective resistance management, concurrent IRS with an organophosphate or DDT must be implemented along with the widespread distribution of pyrethroid treated bed nets. Due to its high frequency of survival, carbamates are not a viable option. Nevertheless, the An. funestus population appears to be fully susceptible to DDT, offering the possibility of using DDT for IRS, perhaps in rotation with one of the organophosphates."
"The use of bed nets is already widespread on the island and varies greatly in terms of treatment, age, and condition. Although nets are available in many households, they are not always being used. Thus, if implementing a strategy that combines bed nets and IRS, it is crucial to educate and monitor residents to ensure consistent use of bed nets. If mosquito populations decline due to seasonal changes or control measures, some individuals may stop using the nets altogether. Furthermore, due to the fact that the community depends on fishing for its livelihood, some nets may be repurposed for this purpose (refer to Figure 2 for more details).","The island already has extensive usage of bed nets, with a range of treated and untreated nets in different conditions, such as old and new, damaged and intact. However, there is considerable variation in the use of bed nets. Many households have bed nets, but not everyone uses them consistently. Thus, if a bed net and IRS combination approach is being considered, it's essential to ensure that education and monitoring are in place to promote consistent use of bed nets. When mosquito populations decrease due to seasonal changes or control measures, some people may stop using the nets. Additionally, given that fishing provides a livelihood for many people in the community, some nets may be used for this purpose (see Figure 2 for more information).","The usage of bed nets on the island is already prevalent, with a variety of nets available that differ in their treatments, age, and condition. However, there is noticeable variability in their usage, with many households having bed nets but not using them regularly. Therefore, if a bed net and IRS combination strategy is being considered, education and monitoring will be vital for maintaining consistent net usage. As mosquito populations decrease due to seasonal changes or control measures, many people may stop using bed nets. Furthermore, in a fishing-dependent community, some nets may be re-purposed for fishing activities (refer to Figure 2 for additional details)."
"The identification of pyrethroid and carbamate resistance in the An. funestus population approximately 1,500 km north of Chokwe in southern Mozambique - as depicted in Figure 1 - is the most concerning finding of this survey. In 2006, samples collected from central Mozambique indicated that An. funestus had a mortality rate of over 95% to pyrethroids and carbamates, according to a report by Casimiro et al. [9]. The WHO's criteria suggest that susceptibility at this level needs further investigation, but control programs may not change policy based solely on this frequency of resistance/susceptibility.","In this survey, the most worrying aspect was the detection of pyrethroid and carbamate resistance in the An. funestus population situated roughly 1,500 km north of its known range in southern Mozambique as Figure 1 details [10]. According to Casimiro et al.'s report in 2006, An. funestus from central Mozambique exhibited more than 95% mortality to pyrethroids and carbamates [9]. Although the WHO's criteria suggest conducting further investigations in such a scenario, it is unlikely that a control program would alter its policy solely on this level of resistance or susceptibility.","The most alarming finding of this survey is that the An. funestus population exhibits pyrethroid and carbamate resistance, which has been detected around 1,500 km north of Chokwe in southern Mozambique, as per Figure 1 [10]. Samples obtained from central Mozambique in 2006 indicated that An. funestus had more than 95% mortality to pyrethroids and carbamates, according to a report published by Casimiro et al. [9]. Although the susceptibility level of this magnitude necessitates further investigation under the WHO criteria, a control program is unlikely to change its policy primarily based on resistance/susceptibility frequencies."
"Likoma Island is positioned in Lake Malawi in close proximity to Mozambique. It is believed that mosquitoes may travel from Mozambique via wind or boats that operate between the island and the mainland, further suggesting that the An. funestus population in Northern Mozambique is also resistant. This could have grave consequences for current malaria control efforts in the region. Since resistance to both pyrethroid and carbamate is present in the Likoma population, it is indicative that resistance is expanding northwards through gene flow in An. funestus populations as opposed to arising through genetic mutation events. As there are no apparent physical barriers to gene flow, the resistance is expected to spread northwards into southern Tanzania and westwards into Zambia and Zimbabwe. Moreover, observations indicate that the resistance found in An. funestus populations from Uganda differs from that in populations in southern Africa, regarding susceptibility tests and molecular characterization of P450 genes.","The island of Likoma in Lake Malawi is located just a few kilometers away from Mozambique, and it is possible that mosquitoes are carried over through wind or via boats that travel from the island to the mainland. As a result, it is probable that An. funestus populations in northern Mozambique are already resistant, creating serious concerns for malaria control attempts in the region. Similar to populations further south, pyrethroid and carbamate resistance has been found in the An. funestus populations on Likoma, indicating that resistance is likely spreading northwards through gene flow rather than separate genetic mutations. There are no evident geographical obstacles to gene flow in this area of southern Africa, and it can be assumed that resistance will expand northwards into southern Tanzania and westwards into Zambia and Zimbabwe. The recent finding of resistance in An. funestus populations from Uganda signifies a difference from that found in populations from southern Africa based on susceptibility tests and molecular characterization of P450 genes.","Located in Lake Malawi, Likoma Island is just a few kilometers from Mozambique, and the mosquitoes might be transported by wind or ships that sail between the island and the mainland. It could then be assumed that the An. funestus population in northern Mozambique is also resistant to malaria, which could affect malaria control initiatives underway in the area. Concerningly, the An. funestus population on Likoma Island has exhibited resistance to both pyrethroid and carbamate, similar to other populations in southern regions, suggesting that resistance is spreading northwards via gene flow instead of genetic mutations. With no apparent barriers to gene flow in southern Africa, it's probable that the resistance will spread northwards into southern Tanzania and westwards into Zambia and Zimbabwe. However, a recent observation of An. funestus resistance from Uganda shows differences from the one found in southern Africa's populations based on susceptibility tests and molecular characterization of P450 genes."
The urgent requirement for resistance management programs within malaria vector control initiatives in southern Africa highlights the gravity of the rapid increase of insecticide resistance in An. funestus. This paper carries the message of the seriousness of this issue that is currently being faced by the region.,"In order to tackle the rapid spread of insecticide resistance observed in An. funestus in southern Africa, it is necessary to prioritize resistance management strategies within malaria vector control programs in the region. This paper brings to light the seriousness of the situation and highlights the urgent need for action to address this issue.","The rapid emergence of insecticide resistance in An. funestus in southern Africa is a pressing concern that needs to be addressed urgently through resistance management strategies implemented within malaria vector control programs. The gravity of this issue is underscored by this paper, which emphasizes the need for proactive measures to be taken within the region to address this growing problem."
"Hypoxia is a condition in which there is a lack of oxygen, and solid tumors are known to have abnormal hyperactivity of angiogenesis, which is the process of creating new blood vessels from existing ones. This process is strictly controlled by specific molecules that can either activate or inhibit it under normal physiological conditions. However, solid tumors eventually trigger angiogenesis to overcome the lack of oxygen and nutrients they face after reaching a specific burden. Hypoxia-activated angiogenesis is mainly mediated by the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF-A), which is produced by tumor cells when they sense low oxygen levels. In addition to hypoxia-mediated initiation, VEGF-A expression can also be induced by non-hypoxia-mediated activation, such as Ras signaling.","The process of angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, with its activation facilitated by proangiogenic factors and inhibition controlled by antiangiogenic factors. However, solid tumors exhibit abnormal hyperactivation of angiogenesis, and this is related to their need to overcome hypoxia, which is the lack of oxygen, and absence of necessary nutrients. An important mediator of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis is the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF-A), which is produced by tumor cells after sensing low oxygen levels. VEGF-A expression can also be induced through non-hypoxia-mediated activation, such as Ras signaling.","Angiogenesis is the process of creating new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, which is tightly regulated by specific molecules that either enable or inhibit the process. In contrast, solid tumors have been associated with abnormal hyperactivation of angiogenesis as a result of hypoxia, a condition marked by oxygen deficiency. This enables the tumor cells to overcome the lack of nutrients and oxygen that would hinder their growth and continued proliferation. The Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF-A) is an essential mediator of angiogenesis activation in hypoxic conditions, resulting in the formation of new blood vessels to supply the necessary nutrients to the tumor. Additionally, VEGF-A expression may also be activated through non-hypoxia-mediated mechanisms such as Ras signaling."
"VEGF-A is a crucial component of tumor-induced angiogenesis, with its overexpression having been observed in the majority of solid tumor types. VEGF-A communicates with its receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, present on bone marrow-derived and endothelial cells. Targeting the VEGF pathway has been a significant strategy to prevent tumor angiogenesis. Over the years, scientists have developed a range of molecules that block various components of the VEGF-A pathway. Some of these agents, like bevacizumab (Avastin庐, Genentech) and sunitinib (Sutent庐, Pfizer), have already been introduced into clinical practice. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inactivates VEGF-A by binding to it, while sunitinib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor that prevents phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine-kinase receptors containing VEGFR1 and VEGFR2.","VEGF-A is a critical mediator of tumor-induced angiogenesis, and its upregulation has been recorded in most types of solid tumors. The VEGF-A molecule interacts with its associated receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, found on endothelial or bone marrow-derived cells. The VEGF pathway, which is a key target of anti-angiogenic therapies, has been the focus of drug development. Several molecules have been discovered in recent years that can inhibit different components of the VEGF-A pathway. A few of these drugs, like bevacizumab (Avastin庐, Genentech) and sunitinib (Sutent庐, Pfizer), have already made their way into clinical practice. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inactivates VEGF-A by binding to it, whereas sunitinib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor that blocks the phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine-kinase receptors, including VEGFR1 and VEGFR2.","VEGF-A is an essential participant in tumor-induced angiogenesis, and its expression is elevated in most forms of solid tumors. VEGF-A signals through its receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, which are present on endothelial and bone marrow-derived cells. The VEGF signaling pathway has been a significant target for blocking tumor angiogenesis, and scientists have developed several drug molecules that bind and inhibit various components of the VEGF-A pathway. Some of these drugs, such as bevacizumab (Avastin庐, Genentech), a monoclonal antibody that binds and inactivates VEGF-A, and sunitinib (Sutent庐, Pfizer), a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor that blocks the phosphorylation of several tyrosine-kinase receptors, including VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, have already proven their therapeutic value in clinical practice."
"The VEGF-A gene comprises 8 exons and creates 5 main alternatively spliced isoforms (VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206), and it can generate lengthier isoforms via alternative translation codons. Nevertheless, the significance of these isoforms remains uncertain. Recently, a novel set of isoforms called ""b-isoforms"" or ""VEGFxxxb"" isoforms were discovered, which code for lengthy polypeptides similar to classic isoforms. However, these isoforms are unique due to the substitution of exon 8 with the same-sized alternatively spliced exon (exon 8b), which acts as potential antagonists of VEGF-A receptors. Exon 8 is essential for receptor activation in classically studied isoforms. As a result, ""b-isoforms"" were previously mentioned to act as potential antagonists of VEGF-A receptors. Some studies indicated that VEGF165b has anti-angiogenic properties, while others suggested it may work as an agonist of VEGF-A receptors.","The VEGF-A gene is made up of 8 exons and can produce 5 primary alternatively spliced isoforms (VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206), with the potential for longer isoforms to be generated. The significance of these isoforms remains uncertain. Recently, a novel group of isoforms referred to as ""b-isoforms"" or ""VEGFxxxb"" isoforms were discovered. These isoforms generate polypeptides equivalent in length to classic isoforms, with exon 8 (present in all previously known isoforms) being replaced by an alternately spliced exon of the same size (exon 8b). As a result of the exon 8 substitution, the ""b-isoforms"" were hypothesized to have the potential to act as antagonists of VEGF-A receptors. Exon 8 is recognized to be essential for receptor activation in classically studied isoforms. Some research indicates that VEGF165b may have anti-angiogenic activity, while others suggest that it may act as an agonist of VEGF-A receptors.","The VEGF-A gene has eight exons, leading to the development of five primary alternatively spliced isoforms (VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206). Longer isoforms can also be created due to the employment of alternative translation codons upstream of the canonical ATG codon. The contribution of these isoforms remains uncertain. Recently, a unique set of isoforms named ""b-isoforms"" or ""VEGFxxxb"" isoforms have been reported. These transcripts of the VEGF-A gene have the potential to produce polypeptides identical in length to classical ones since exon 8, found in all known isoforms, is substituted with the same-sized alternatively spliced exon (exon 8b). These ""b-isoforms"" are considered to act as possible antagonists of VEGF-A receptors because exon 8, known to be fundamental for receptor activation in classically investigated isoforms, is replaced by another peptide sequence. Research reports suggest that VEGF165b can have anti-angiogenic effects, while some others doubt its effectiveness, considering it may act as an agonist of VEGF-A receptors."
"An interesting point of discussion is the probable discrepancy in expression of ""angiogenic"" and ""antiangiogenic"" isoforms in diseases involving abnormal vasculature growth, such as cancer. Previous studies have shown that VEGFxxxb isoforms are expressed at higher levels in regular prostate, colon, and kidney tissues when compared to their cancerous counterparts, based on semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis on a limited number of samples [14,18,19]. It is postulated that formation of neovasculature during pathological conditions could modify alternative splicing of VEGFA, leading to increased expression of the ""b-isoforms"" (which consist of anti-angiogenic properties) at the expense of the classical angiogenic isoforms. Interestingly, the VEGFxxxb/VEGF ratio may serve as a biomarker of angiogenic disease, offering significant implications for further research [13].","The concept of differential expression between ""angiogenic"" versus ""antiangiogenic"" isoforms in diseases that involve the growth of abnormal vasculature, such as cancer, is a fascinating topic. Earlier studies have revealed that the VEGFxxxb isoforms are highly expressed in regular prostate, colon, and kidney tissues in comparison to their malignantly transformed counterparts, using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and with a limited number of samples [14,18,19]. The idea is that the development of new blood vessels during pathological conditions could change the alternative splicing of VEGFA, causing an increase in expression of the ""b-isoforms"" at the expense of the conventional assemblage of angiogenic isoforms, which is also an interesting finding as the VEGFxxxb/VEGF ratio of expression could be utilized as a biomarker of angiogenic disease [13].","An interesting subject of discussion is the difference in expression of ""angiogenic"" versus ""antiangiogenic"" isoforms in pathologies involving the development of abnormal vasculature, such as cancer. Prior research has shown that VEGFxxxb isoforms are highly expressed in normal prostate, colon, and kidney tissues compared to their malignant counterparts, with the use of semi-quantitative RT-PCR on limited samples [14,18,19]. It has been suggested that the formation of neovasculature in pathological conditions could alter alternative splicing of VEGFA, leading to an increase in the expression of the ""b-isoforms"" (known to be inhibitory to angiogenesis) at the expense of the conventional angiogenic family of isoforms, which could be an exciting discovery, as the VEGFxxxb/VEGF ratio of expression could serve as a tool for diagnosing angiogenic diseases [13]."

"Matrigel plug assays were carried out to assess the impact of VEGF121/165b isoforms on the functioning of endothelial cells in vivo. Matrigel was combined with bFGF or VEGF165 from R&D or VEGF121b(pp) or VEGF165b(pp). The identification of blood vessels within the Matrigel plugs was accomplished by administering an Alexa-647-labelled isolectin B4, which was systemically delivered to the mice before they were sacrificed (Figure 5A). The Alexa-647-labelled lectin showed no signal in the control Matrigels, whereas plugs carrying any VEGFxxxb isoforms indicated a positive signal, thus confirming in vivo angiogenesis (Figure 5A).

"The researchers chose high (PC-3) and low (A549) endogenous total VEGF expressing cell lines for their in vivo assays. To investigate the impact of VEGF 121/165 b isoforms on tumor growth and angiogenesis, the team overexpressed these isoforms in both PC-3 and A549 xenograft models. Western blot analyses revealed that G418-selected cell pools expressed high levels of VEGF121b or VEGF165b. A comparison of tumors overexpressing VEGF121b, VEGF165b or both with the control tumors in PC3 xenografts did not show any significant differences in tumor growth. The only notable difference was a tendency for VEGF121b-overexpressing cells to form larger tumors than the other groups. In contrast, injection of cells overexpressing VEGF121b or VEGF165b into A549 xenografts led to significant increases in tumor volume when compared to control tumors.

Pools of selected cells over a 20-day period using G418 displayed high levels of VEGF121b or VEGF165b, based on Western blot analyses (Figure 6A). Results indicated that in PC3 xenografts, there were no statistical distinctions between control tumors and tumors that overexpressed either or both isoforms. In contrast, VEGF121b-overexpressing cells resulted in a tendency towards more significant tumor formation than other experimental conditions (Figure 6B). Nonetheless, the in vivo studies involving A549 xenografts showed a significant increase in tumor volume when VEGF121b or VEGF165b were administered in comparison to the control group (Figure 6C). Thus, overexpressing VEGF121/165 b isoforms resulted in tumor growth rather than tumor shrinkage in these models."
"The analysis of angiogenesis suggests that the A549 tumors were found to be less angiogenic than the PC-3 tumors. Despite this, there were no differences among the control and experimental groups. VEGF121b-overexpressing tumors in PC-3 showed a higher level of vascularization. The analysis of PDGFRb levels by immunohistochemistry and image analysis did not reveal any decrease in PDGFRb+ cells in either PC-3 or A549 xenografted tumors. Apoptotic cells were also quantified, and the number of active caspase-3+ cells in A549 xenografts did not show any changes. In PC-3 xenografted tumors, no increase, but rather a reduction in the number of apoptotic cells, was observed when VEGFxxxboverexpressing cells were injected compared to controls.","Analysis of angiogenesis indicated that A549 tumors were less angiogenic than PC-3 tumors, and no differences were observed between control and experimental groups. In PC-3 tumors, tumors with VEGF121b-overexpression showed a significant increase in vascularization compared to parental, mock-transfected, and VEGF165b groups. The study also analyzed possible mural recruitment to the vasculature by assessing the levels of PDGFRb via immunohistochemistry and image analysis. However, no significant changes were observed in PDGFRb+ cells in A549 or PC-3 xenografted tumors. The study also quantified apoptotic cells by analyzing the number of active caspase-3+ cells. In A549 tumors, no changes were observed; however, in PC-3 xenografts, VEGFxxxboverexpressing cells showed a reduction in apoptotic cells compared to controls.","The analysis of angiogenesis revealed that A549 tumors showed less angiogenic potential than PC-3 tumors, but there were no observable differences between control and experimental groups.

"From previous studies, it was suggested that VEGFxxxb isoforms may have varying levels of expression in normal and pathological conditions [13]. To investigate whether this was also true for breast cancer, a TMA sample was used containing core biopsies of breast cancer patients and normal breast tissue. A validated antibody that detects total VEGF-A (including all VEGF-A isoforms) was used (R&D systems) in conjunction with the only credible anti-VEGFxxxb antibody that detects all VEGFxxxb proteins (R&D systems) [18]. It's important to note that currently there is no antibody available that is specific to ""non-b"" isoforms (i.e. VEGFxxx).","Prior research has indicated that there may be differential expression of VEGFxxxb isoforms in normal versus pathological conditions [13].

"The images in Figures 8A and 8B display samples of malignant and normal breast tissues which were stained with the anti-VEGFxxxb and anti-total VEGF-A antibodies. VEGFxxxb staining in tumor cells of infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) samples was found to be strong. The staining was also significant in other types of tumors, including papillary carcinoma (Pap), phyllodes (Phy), infiltrating lobular carcinomas (ILC), and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Conversely, VEGFxxxb was not detected in any samples of normal breast tissue (NBT). Additionally, all tissues were positive for total-VEGF-A, including the normal breast epithelium. Evaluation of the staining found that both total-VEGF-A and VEGFxxxb protein levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in IDC compared to normal breast tissues (Figures 8C and 8D). Moreover, there was a strong (p = 0.033) positive correlation index (r = 0.404) between VEGFxxxb and total-VEGF-A, which indicated the degree of co-staining. Therefore, it can be concluded that VEGFxxxb levels are not decreased in malignant breast cancer but instead tend to rise in tumor samples with infiltrating ductal carcinoma having significantly higher levels.","Figures 8A and 8B illustrate images of both malignant and normal breast tissues that were subjected to staining with the anti-VEGFxxxb and anti-total VEGF-A antibodies. The results indicated prominent staining for VEGFxxxb in tumor cells of infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) samples as well as in other types of tumors, such as papillary carcinoma (Pap), phyllodes (Phy), infiltrating lobular carcinomas (ILC) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). No VEGFxxxb was observed in any of the normal breast tissues (NBT). Nonetheless, all tissues analyzed showed positivity for total-VEGF-A, including normal breast epithelium. Semiquantification of staining showed both VEGFxxxb and total VEGF-A protein levels were substantially elevated (p < 0.05) in IDC as opposed to normal breast tissues (Figures 8C and 8D). Moreover, a positive correlation index (r = 0.404) was observed along with a significant (p = 0.033) relationship between VEGFxxxb and total-VEGF-A, indicating the degree of co-staining. Therefore, the findings suggest that VEGFxxxb levels are not lowered in malignant breast cancer; instead, they are inclined to increase in tumor samples and are significantly higher in infiltrating ductal carcinomas.","The representative images in Figures 8A and 8B depict malignant and normal breast tissues that were stained using anti-VEGFxxxb and anti-total VEGF-A antibodies.

"The significance of VEGF-A in normal and pathological angiogenesis has been extensively studied and documented in recent years. VEGF-A has been identified as a crucial target for cancer therapy in solid tumors. Currently, VEGF-targeting agents such as bevacizumab and sunitinib are being used in patients with cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying the production of VEGF-A spliced isoforms remain largely unknown. It may be necessary to understand how the different VEGF-A isoforms are generated through alternative splicing to design more specific and effective molecular therapies.","Over the past few decades, researchers have thoroughly investigated and documented the crucial role of VEGF-A in normal and pathological angiogenesis. Consequently, VEGF-A has emerged as a major target for cancer therapy in solid tumors.

Despite these advancements, our knowledge of the splicing of VEGF-A isoforms remains limited.

"In 2002, scientists reported the existence of a new set of VEGF-A isoforms created through alternative splicing that they named VEGFxxxb isoforms. These isoforms contain a distinct exon (called exon 8b) from the angiogenic transcripts' classical exon 8a, which is called sequence SLTRKD rather than CDKPRR. VEGFxxxb isoforms were thought to be antiangiogenic due to their capacity to bind VEGF-A receptors without significant downstream signaling activation, which was attributed to the inclusion of exon 8b. In tumor cells that were transplanted into nude mice, overexpressing VEGF 165 b or VEGF 121 b resulted in growth inhibition, as was discovered. Another important observation was that VEGFxxxb isoforms may exhibit differential expression in pathological tissues compared to normal tissues, changing the natural splicing to favor VEGFxxx transcripts in some aberrant angiogenesis-linked diseases while decreasing the amount of VEGFxxxb isoforms primarily present in normal tissues.","In 2002, researchers announced the discovery of a new family of VEGF-A isoforms generated by alternative splicing. These isoforms, known as VEGFxxxb isoforms, include a distinct exon, exon 8b, that differs from the classical exon 8a found in angiogenic transcripts, with the former sequence being SLTRKD and the latter sequence being CDKPRR. Incorporating exon 8b is believed to grant VEGFxxxb isoforms the ability to bind VEGF-A receptors without triggering strong downstream signaling activation, hence their hypothesized anti-angiogenic qualities. VEGF 165 b or VEGF 121 b overexpression resulted in growth inhibition when implanted into nude mice's tumor cells, as demonstrated. Additionally, VEGFxxxb isoforms may be expressed differently in pathological tissues than in normal tissues, resulting in changes to natural splicing that favor VEGFxxx transcripts in certain aberrant angiogenesis-linked diseases while decreasing the amount of VEGFxxxb isoforms found mostly in normal tissues.","Researchers reported a novel family of VEGF-A isoforms in 2002, created via alternative splicing, dubbed VEGFxxxb isoforms. These isoforms possess a different exon, exon 8b, which is distinct from the classical exon 8a of angiogenic transcripts, with the former having the SLTRKD sequence and the latter having the CDKPRR sequence. VEGFxxxb isoforms are thought to be anti-angiogenic due to their ability to bind VEGF-A receptors while limiting downstream signaling activation, attributed to the inclusion of exon 8b. When overexpressed in tumor cells of nude mice, VEGF 165 b or VEGF 121 b inhibited growth. Another essential observation is that VEGFxxxb isoforms might undergo distinct expression patterns in pathological tissues relative to normal tissues, favoring VEGFxxx transcripts through natural splicing modification in some angiogenesis-linked diseases while reducing the abundance of VEGFxxxb isoforms mostly expressed in normal tissues."
"In the current investigation, our primary objective was to produce recombinant VEGF 121 b and VEGF165b proteins in the Pichia pastoris yeast with the intention of assessing their potential antiangiogenic and antitumor properties both in vitro and in vivo. We also utilized the PCDNA3.1 plasmid for generating cancer cells that overexpress VEGF121/165b. We selected the yeast expression system for several reasons, including its ability to glycosylate and purify proteins with little contamination from yeast-derived endogenous proteins. Additionally, this system was faster, easier, and more cost-effective compared to mammalian systems. Furthermore, by utilizing this system, we could eliminate the possibility of VEGF-A contamination containing exon 8 and the resulting exons 8 and 8b heterodimer formation since yeasts do not code for any form of VEGF.","The aim of our study was to create VEGF 121 b and VEGF165b recombinant proteins in the yeast Pichia pastoris for the purpose of evaluating their potential antiangiogenic and antitumor properties, both in vivo and in vitro.

The yeast expression system was chosen based on several factors, including its ability to glycosylate proteins and purify them while minimizing the contamination from yeast-derived endogenous proteins that can interfere with the purity of the recombinant protein of interest. Furthermore, the yeast system offered a faster, easier, and more cost-effective protein production process compared to traditional mammalian systems. In addition, we ensured that this expression system did not contain VEGF-A contamination containing exon 8, or any form of VEGF since yeasts do not code for VEGF. This was essential as it helps eliminate the risk of exons 8 and 8b heterodimer formation, since VEGF-A is secreted and active in its dimeric form.","The main objective of our study was to generate VEGF 121 b and VEGF165b recombinant proteins in the yeast Pichia pastoris to explore their potential antitumor and antiangiogenic properties in vitro and in vivo.

Firstly, it has the ability to glycosylate proteins and purify them without contaminating proteins from yeast. Moreover, it enables faster, more efficient and cheaper protein production than traditional mammalian system. In addition, this expression system prevents the presence of exon 8-containing VEGF-A contamination which can lead to exons 8 and 8b heterodimer formation, since yeasts do not have any form of VEGF. Since VEGF-A is active in its dimeric form, this is of particular importance."
"Recombinant forms of VEGF121b and VEGF165b were created successfully, which possess similar structural characteristics to the traditional VEGF121 and VEGF165 proteins. These proteins have the capability to create dimers or multimers and react with commercial antibodies created specifically for exons 1 to 5, which are shared by all VEGF-A isoforms.

Additionally, the recombinant proteins displayed immunoreactivity with a credible antibody that acknowledges exon 8b, which was created by R&D."
"To test the functionality of the isoforms in vitro, the researchers treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with recombinant proteins produced in yeasts, VEGF165 b produced in mammalian cells, or the ""classical"" VEGF165 angiogenic protein, as a control. The treatments were all conducted in serum-free media. The results showed that VEGF121/165b isoforms caused HUVECs to proliferate and induced phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and ERK, a downstream transducer. Although the effect of VEGF121/165b was weaker than VEGF165, the degree of ERK activation was similar for all proteins tested 10 minutes after stimulation.

"VEGF165b has unique functional characteristics as shown by Kawamura et al. [16]. They found that VEGF165b is a weaker agonist of VEGFR2 compared to VEGF145, but can still phosphorylate VEGFR2 in HUVECs. Like VEGF121, VEGF165b does not bind neuropilin-1 (NRP1) or induce complexes between NRP1 and VEGFR2. It promotes cell migration, but does not induce endothelial sprout formation. VEGF165b cannot phosphorylate mouse VEGFR2 at Y1052, and it may prevent transphosphorylation by partially blocking receptor's intracellular tail rotation upon binding. Glass et al.

"To validate the angiogenic properties of VEGF 121/165b observed in in vitro tests, we conducted in vivo experiments with Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel, which has considerably lower levels of angiogenic cytokines, including VEGF. The addition of recombinant VEGF 121 b, VEGF 165 b, or VEGF 165 to the Matrigel increased the recruitment of blood vessels compared to the PBS-loaded control group, thereby demonstrating an angiogenic effect. It's worth noting that the Matrigels containing VEGF121b exhibited significantly high levels of dextran-FITC signals both inside and outside the vessels, similar to those found for bFGF.

"During our study, we sought to determine if overexpressing VEGF121/165b in xenograft models could inhibit tumor growth in vivo. To achieve this, we picked the A549 cell line, a low-VEGF-expressing lung adenocarcinoma that secretes ~1-5 pg/mL, and the PC-3, a prostate cancer cell line that secretes ~800 pg/mL. Our goal was to analyze any possible variations in the VEGFxxxb behavior depending on the endogenous VEGF expression levels. We executed experiments without any additional exogenous VEGF stimulation, such as transfecting VEGF. Although we did not find any noteworthy differences between control and VEGF121/165b-expressing PC3 xenografts, we did observe a tendency for VEGF121b-overexpressing tumors to grow at a faster rate than the other groups. Vascular density for VEGF121b-overexpressing PC-3 tumors was significantly higher than observed for the rest of the groups, and there were significantly lower apoptotic levels. A549 xenografts formed small tumors and grew slowly after subcutaneous implantation in nude mice, which agrees with previous studies [30].","To investigate the tumor growth inhibition ability of VEGF121/165b overexpression in vivo, we conducted tests utilizing xenograft models.

"Despite previous studies suggesting that VEGF 165 b possesses anti-tumor effects, the results of this research contradict this claim. The reason for this discrepancy may be due to variations in VEGF expression in different in vivo models used in previous research. In models where VEGF is expressed at high levels, overexpression of VEGFxxxb and VEGFxxx proteins result in equal competition for receptor binding, leading to reduced tumor growth with VEGFxxxb overexpression. However, in models with low VEGF expression, overexpression of VEGFxxxb could actually enhance tumor growth to some extent. This hypothesis is supported by the findings that no difference in tumor growth between parental and VEGF165b-overexpressing CAKI cells was observed when VEGF levels were around 900 pg/mL.","The present study contradicts prior research indicating that VEGF 165 b has anti-tumor properties. The authors propose that differences in the levels of VEGF expression in various in vivo models may account for this contradiction. In models where VEGF expression is high, VEGFxxxb and VEGFxxx proteins compete equally for receptor binding, resulting in reduced tumor growth when VEGFxxxb is overexpressed. Conversely, when tumors have low VEGF production, overexpression of VEGFxxxb could potentially promote tumor growth to some extent. This hypothesis appears to be supported by the fact that there was no notable difference in tumor growth between parental and VEGF 165 b-transfected CAKI cells, which had VEGF levels of approximately 900 pg/mL.","The contradictory findings of this study to prior reports that suggest VEGF 165 b has anti-tumor effects are noteworthy. The authors offer an explanation that the in vivo models used in the previous research expressed high VEGF levels, either from the nature of the cells employed, or by transfection with VEGF-carrying plasmids. In these conditions, VEGFxxxb isoforms have shown to reduce tumor growth through competing equally with VEGFxxx for receptor binding. However, since VEGFxxxb has a weaker signaling ability, overexpression of VEGFxxxb can stimulate tumor growth to an extent in low VEGF production tumors. In support of this hypothesis, the study results found no difference in tumor growth between parental and VEGF165b-overexpressing CAKI cells when VEGF levels were around 900 pg/mL. Only when parental cells were transfected with VEGF 165 was a reduction in tumor volume observed as compared to VEGF165b-overexpressing tumors."
"It is conceivable that VEGFxxxb protein treatments might prove effective as a therapeutic approach in tumors that exhibit high levels of VEGF expression of an endogenous nature. Despite this, the application of such treatments in instances of tumors exhibiting low VEGF levels that rely on other angiogenic factors, which may include bFGF, IL-8 and similar elements, for their growth, could potentially serve to exacerbate rather than ameliorate the progression of the tumor. Consequently, administering VEGFxxxb protein as a therapeutic intervention raises some uncertainties regarding its utilization among patients who might not be suitable. It is, therefore, essential to take caution while identifying individuals who might benefit from VEGFxxxb-based therapies, doing so through a process of patient stratification based on VEGF production levels. This forms a critical aspect that future clinical trials will have to take into consideration.","The administration of VEGFxxxb proteins as a therapeutic for tumors with high endogenous VEGF expression may be effective. However, for tumors with low VEGF levels that rely on other factors like bFGF, IL-8 for growth, using VEGFxxxb therapy may potentially worsen the disease's progression. Therefore, the possibility of using VEGFxxxb therapy on unselected patients is questionable, and caution is required in defining which patients could benefit from VEGFxxxb-based therapies. It is vital to identify the amount of VEGF production in patients and stratify them accordingly, making it a critical aspect to consider for conducting potential clinical trials.","The effectiveness of therapies based on VEGFxxxb proteins can be higher in tumors exhibiting excessive endogenous VEGF expression. But the therapy's administration in tumors with low VEGF levels, which primarily rely on other angiogenic factors such as bFGF, IL-8 for growth, could negatively affect their disease progression. Hence, using VEGFxxxb as a therapeutic approach raises doubts about its wider applicability in patients. It is imperative to exercise caution and determine patients that could benefit from treatments using VEGFxxxb-based therapies. A critical aspect of future clinical trials is to stratify patients based on their VEGF production level to identify those who can benefit from VEGFxxxb-based therapies."
"The VEGFxxxb biology needs to be understood before therapy translation can occur. It is surprising that VEGF121b not only prompted endothelial cell migration inhibition, but also provided cytoprotection for the cells in serum starvation experiments. The protection was enabled by the activation of VEGF receptors and downstream signalling, behaving similarly to VEGF165. VEGF165 co-expression with VEGF165b led to smaller tumors in some xenograft models than when VEGF165b was overexpressed alone. It remains unclear whether the VEGFxxxb proteins can heterodimerize with other members of the VEGFxxx angiogenic family, and this question needs answering.","Prior to the translation of therapy involving VEGFxxxb, there are several aspects of its biology that must be elucidated. One of these is the unexpected finding that while VEGF121b is known to inhibit the migration of endothelial cells, it is also cytoprotective for these cells under serum starvation conditions by activating VEGF receptors and downstream signalling, similarly to VEGF165. Moreover, the co-expression of VEGF165 and VEGF165b in some xenograft models results in smaller tumors compared to overexpression of only VEGF165b. Additionally, further research is necessary to determine whether VEGFxxxb proteins can heterodimerize with members of the VEGFxxx angiogenic family.","A thorough understanding of the VEGFxxxb biology is essential prior to the translation of this type of therapy. It is surprising that the activation of VEGF receptors and downstream signalling by VEGF121b results in cytoprotection for endothelial cells and inhibits their migration, similar to the effect of VEGF165. Co-expression of VEGF165 and VEGF165b in xenograft models leads to smaller tumors compared to overexpression of only VEGF165b. There is a need to determine whether VEGFxxxb proteins can combine with other members of the VEGFxxx angiogenic family. These are some questions that should be clarified before initiating therapy translation involving VEGFxxxb."
"In this study, we investigated whether there is a difference in the expression of VEGFxxxb isoforms between malignant tissues (human breast cancer) and healthy tissues (normal mammary gland). We utilized immunohistochemistry experiments with validated antibodies that target all VEGFxxxb isoforms and antibodies that recognize all VEGF transcripts. Our results showed that there is a tendency for both total VEGF and VEGFxxxb to increase in breast cancer tissues (n = 50) compared to normal tissue (n = 8), with statistically significant increases seen in intraductal carcinomas (IDC). Furthermore, the expression of total VEGF and VEGFxxxb was significantly correlated, suggesting that both families of VEGF may be expressed similarly.","The objective of this study was to explore whether the expression of VEGFxxxb isoforms is different in malignant tissues (human breast cancer) compared to healthy tissues (normal mammary gland). Immunohistochemistry experiments were conducted using validated antibodies specific for all VEGFxxxb isoforms and antibodies capable of recognizing all VEGF transcripts. Our results demonstrated that both total VEGF and VEGFxxxb levels tended to increase in breast cancer samples (n = 50) when compared to normal breast samples (n = 8), with intraductal carcinomas (IDC) showing a statistically significant rise. Expression levels of both total VEGF and VEGFxxxb were strongly correlated, implying that the expression patterns of both VEGF subfamilies (VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb) may be comparable.","The purpose of this study was to determine whether VEGFxxxb isoform expression differs in malignant tissue (human breast cancer) compared to healthy tissue (normal mammary gland). We employed immunohistochemistry experiments with verified antibodies specific to all VEGFxxxb isoforms and antibodies that recognize all VEGF transcripts. Our findings showed that both total VEGF and VEGFxxxb levels had a tendency to increase in breast cancer samples (n = 50) relative to normal breast tissue samples (n = 8), and this was significantly noticeable in intraductal carcinomas (IDC). The levels of both total VEGF and VEGFxxxb were significantly related, indicating that the expression of both VEGF families (VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb) may follow a similar pattern."
"The extent of VEGFxxxb isoform expression was limitedly investigated in the prior studies. The data showed that the increase in total VEGF mRNA levels was due to the VEGFxxx angiogenic isoform, and no significant changes were observed in the VEGFxxxb mRNA levels in colon carcinoma samples, as compared to controls. By using an isoform-specific ELISAs, a similar result was obtained for protein levels. Besides, RT-PCR analysis of normal and malignant tissues indicated the presence of VEGF165b in all normal kidney samples and only in four matched malignant tissues. The neoplastic tissue of melanoma samples, when analyzed using a VEGFxxxb-specific antibody, showed a reduction in VEGFxxxb expression relative to the normal skin. This decrease was more pronounced in metastatic melanoma samples than non-metastatic ones.","Previous research has only looked at the expression of VEGFxxxb isoforms in a limited number of samples. Total VEGF mRNA levels were found to be significantly upregulated in colon carcinoma samples compared to controls. However, there were no changes observed for VEGFxxxb mRNA levels. The upsurge in total VEGF appears to be due to the presence of VEGFxxx angiogenic isoforms. This was also demonstrated through isoform-specific ELISAs that showed protein levels were similar. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated VEGF165b to be present in most normal kidney samples, but only in four of the 18 paired malignant tissues examined. Immunohistochemical analysis of neoplastic vs. normal skin found by VEGFxxxb-specific antibody showed that VEGFxxxb expression was reduced in neoplastic tissues, particularly in metastatic melanoma samples.","Studies carried out in the past analyzed the expression of VEGFxxxb isoforms, but only in a small number of samples. In colon carcinoma samples, it was discovered that total VEGF mRNA levels were markedly increased compared to controls, but VEGFxxxb mRNA levels remained unchanged. This indicates that the rise in total VEGF levels is due to the presence of VEGFxxx angiogenic isoforms. Tests carried out with isoform-specific ELISAs produced a similar result. The RT-PCR analysis of normal and malignant tissues showed that VEGF165b was present in all normal kidney samples and only in four of the 18 paired malignant tissues examined. The results of immunohistochemical analysis of neoplastic tissue compared to normal skin using a VEGFxxxb-specific antibody showed that the expression of VEGFxxxb was reduced in neoplastic tissues and particularly, in metastatic melanoma samples."
"Assessing the expression patterns of VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb proteins in malignant and normal tissues is problematic as there are no antibodies that are specific for each protein type. To establish whether VEGFxxxb expression is a viable biomarker for cancer, upcoming research that makes use of a larger number of samples, as well as quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses, will be necessary.","The inability to find suitable antibodies that are specific to both VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb proteins makes it difficult to fully characterize their expression patterns in malignant and normal tissues. To determine the viability of using VEGFxxxb expression as a cancer biomarker, further studies involving a higher number of samples and employing quantitative real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses are required.","Adequate antibodies that are specific to each type of VEGFxxx and VEGFxxxb proteins are not readily available, which hampers the precise evaluation of their expression patterns in malign and standard tissues. To determine whether VEGFxxxb expression could serve as a viable biomarker for malignancy, future research utilizing a larger sample size, quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and immunohistochemical analysis would be necessary."
"The report reveals that VEGF121/165b are not antiangiogenic, but feeble pro-angiogenic versions of VEGF-A that may prompt the progression of tumors and angiogenesis in vivo. The study also suggests that VEGFxxxb isoforms, as well as total VEGF levels, exhibit increased expression in breast cancer when compared to non-cancerous breast tissue.","The results demonstrate that VEGF121/165b are not anti-angiogenic, but instead are slightly pro-angiogenic forms of VEGF-A that may aid in tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. Additionally, it was concluded that VEGFxxxb isoforms (as well as total VEGF levels) are up-regulated in breast cancer in comparison to non-cancerous breast tissues, according to the study.","The study findings demonstrate that VEGF121/165b are not anti-angiogenic, rather they are weakly pro-angiogenic versions of VEGF-A that may promote tumor development and angiogenesis in vivo.

"In the quest to create vaccines for different pathogens, DNA vaccines have been widely studied. Research shows that DNA vaccines can generate both cellular and humoral immune responses [4]. Some studies have found that they are effective in producing protective immune responses to various viruses [5,6]. However, one of the challenges faced by DNA vaccines is that they cannot generate immune responses in mice when given through the intranasal (i.n.) route [7]. Since most respiratory diseases enter the body through the mucosal surface, it is crucial to develop a vaccine that stimulates both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Mucosal immune responses, which rely heavily on secretory IgA, serve as a first-line defense mechanism against influenza virus infections. Although parenteral immunization is not adequate to generate protective immunity, mucosal immune responses are essential [9].","DNA vaccines have been extensively researched in the development of immunization against various pathogens. Studies have shown that these vaccines can induce both cellular and humoral immune responses [4], and some have also reported protective immune responses against multiple viruses [5,6]. One challenge with DNA vaccines is their inability to stimulate immune responses in mice when delivered through the intranasal route [7]. Given that mucosal surfaces are the primary entry site for most respiratory diseases, vaccines that elicit both mucosal and systemic immune responses are ideal. Mucosal immune responses play a crucial role as the frontline defense against influenza virus infections, and secretory IgA plays an essential role in this immune response [8]. While parenteral immunization alone is not sufficient to generate protective immunity, inducing mucosal immune responses is critical to achieving protective immunity [9].","Research efforts to develop vaccines against various pathogens have concentrated on DNA vaccines. These vaccines have shown promise in triggering both cellular and humoral immune responses [4].

As most respiratory diseases enter the body through the mucosal surface, there is a need for vaccines that can elicit both systemic and mucosal immune responses. Mucosal immune responses play a vital role as the first line of defense against influenza virus infections, with secretory IgA playing a crucial role in mediating these defenses [8]. Parenteral immunization is inadequate in generating protective immunity, highlighting the importance of inducing mucosal immune responses [9]."

"To evaluate how PEI impacts the adaptive immunity response to SARS-CoV S protein, mice were given an intranasal SARS-CoV DNA vaccine, and their specific antibody responses were measured. The results showed that the group of mice that received PEI/pci-S complexes produced high levels of SARS-CoV S-specific serum IgG antibody, while those that only received SARS-CoV S DNA did not show the same response (Figure 2A).

"Dendritic cells (DCs) critically contribute to inducing antigen-specific immune responses. These cells can be found in different tissues representing one of the primary sentinel cells [21]. While recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns from microorganisms, DCs undergo a maturation process that endows them the ability for antigen presentation. This maturation process also increases the expression of essential immune molecules, such as MHC proteins, cytokines, and co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80, CD83, and CD86 [22], [23] and [24]. Therefore, the appropriate maturation of DCs is required for suitable activation of adaptive immunity [22]. Intranasal immunization with PEI/pci-S complexes has shown to induce the maturation of DCs in cervical lymph nodes, increasing the expression of co-stimulatory and MHC class II molecules.","The induction of antigen-specific immune responses is largely dependent on the critical role played by dendritic cells (DCs).

"CD4+ and CD8+ T cells mediate cellular immune responses which produce cytokines, such as IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-2, and IL-17, after in vitro re-stimulation with SARS spike peptides. These cytokines have different functions, such as activating macrophages and DCs, inhibiting viral infection, regulating immune cells and inhibiting viral replication, and mediating the expansion of memory T cells and the production of antimicrobial peptides and immunoglobulin to neutralize viral infections. Studies reveal that antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secrete IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-2, and IL-17 in lung tissues after vaccination with PEI/pci-S. Multi-cytokine producing cells likely contribute to protection against SARS-CoV infection after vaccination. Previous studies showed that multi-cytokine producing T cells are more efficient than single-cytokine producing cells for protection against Leishmania major infections.","Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play a role in cellular immune responses that are mediated by cytokines, including IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-2, and IL-17, secreted after SARS spike peptide restimulation. IFN-g activates macrophages and DCs and inhibits viral infections, TNF-a inhibits viral replication and regulates immune cells, IL-2 maintains memory T cells and promotes T cell expansion, and IL-17 mediates the production of antimicrobial peptides to neutralize viral infections. Research indicates that antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells produce these cytokines in non-lymphoid tissues, such as the lung, after vaccination with PEI/pci-S. Multi-cytokine producing cells are increased, and these cells are likely responsible for protection against SARS-CoV infection after vaccination. Multi-cytokine producing antigen-specific CD4+ T cells have been shown to be functionally superior in disease protection than single-cytokine producing cells, as seen in protection against Leishmania major infection in other studies.","CD4+ and CD8+ T cells stimulate cellular immune responses that produce cytokines, such as IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-2, and IL-17, following in vitro restimulation with SARS spike peptides. These cytokines have various impacts, such as activating macrophages and DCs, inhibiting viral infections, modulating immune cells, and inhibiting viral replication. IL-2 promotes memory T cells and T cell expansion, and IL-17 promotes the production of antimicrobial peptides to counteract viral infections. Studies demonstrate that antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells release IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-2, and IL-17 in non-lymphoid tissues, such as the lungs, after receiving PEI/pci-S vaccination. Multiple-cytokine generating cells are increased in mice immunized with PEI/pci-S, and these cells are possibly responsible for protection against SARS-CoV infection post-vaccination. Studies indicate that multi-cytokine secreting antigen-specific CD4+ T cells are superior in disease protection compared to single-cytokine producing cells. These cells have been shown to correlate with protection against Leishmania major infection in several reports."

"Our study examines economic literacy among high school students in Orange County, California. The state made it mandatory for students to study economics since 1985. The course is taught in the senior year and covers both micro and macroeconomic analyses. It is worth noting that California is among the few states (17, according to NCEE June 2007) that require formal economic instruction in secondary education. Despite California's progressive steps in economics education, there is a lack of research that focuses on the effectiveness of formal economics education in the state.

"Based on the available literature, it is evident that economics courses are more effective in enhancing students' economic literacy compared to the infusion of economic content in the K-12 curriculum. Several studies have found that students who enroll in economics courses score higher on the Test of Economic Literacy than their counterparts who are enrolled in social studies classes with no economic content or classes with some economic content. Furthermore, other research indicates that nationwide, students who took economics courses tend to have the highest scores on the TEL multiple choice examination. Coupled with the evidence of controlling the selection bias, this supports the assertion that economics courses play a significant role in enhancing students' economic literacy.

These findings underscore the importance of offering economics education to improve students' understanding of economic concepts. (Mask used: Synonym and rephrasing)","The literature shows that offering students economics courses is more effective in improving their economic literacy than integrating economic content into the K-12 curriculum. Studies have demonstrated that students who took economics courses scored higher on the Test of Economic Literacy (TEL) than their peers who were enrolled in social studies without economic content or classes with limited economic content. National datasets also show that students who took economics courses performed best on the TEL multiple-choice examination. Furthermore, controlling for the selection bias in certain studies has boosted the effect of economics courses on post-test performance. These results confirm the value of economics education in promoting students' proficiency in economic concepts. (Mask used: Paraphrase and synonym)"
"The literature has examined the differences in economic literacy between genders, as evidenced by various studies. One of the most cited articles on the matter is by Siegfried [1979], who reviews the literature and finds that, at a specific point in time, males tend to have a slight advantage in their understanding of economics compared to females. More recent works, such as those by Watts [1987], Heath [1989], Walstad and Soper [1989], Evans [1992], and Walstad and Robson [1997], generally support the notion that there is a gender gap in economic knowledge in high school. This gap, which favors males, has been consistently observed in point-in-time measures of economic knowledge.","The literature has analyzed gender differences in economic literacy, and various studies have explored this topic. Siegfried [1979] conducted a thorough review of the literature and found that males typically have a slight advantage over females in their understanding of economics at a specific point in time. More recent research by Watts [1987], Heath [1989], Walstad and Soper [1989], Evans [1992], and Walstad and Robson [1997] has shown that high school students' point-in-time measures of economic knowledge continue to favor males over females. This gender gap in economic knowledge has been well-established and is statistically significant, although often small.","There is a body of literature that explores gender differences in economic literacy, with multiple studies examining this topic. Siegfried's [1979] work is frequently cited, and it indicates that males demonstrate a slight advantage in their understanding of economics at a specific point in time compared to females. Recent studies have largely supported this finding, with most high school students showing a gender gap in their point-in-time measures of economic knowledge. Works by Watts [1987], Heath [1989], Walstad and Soper [1989], Evans [1992], and Walstad and Robson [1997] all confirm the existence of this gender gap, which typically favors males. The gap is usually statistically significant, albeit often small."
"Based on Siegfried's findings, there is insufficient supporting evidence demonstrating women's inferiority in learning economics when considering other relevant factors that might impact the accumulation of economic knowledge. The female initial disadvantage does not appear to change over time when using a pretest-posttest design to measure gain in economic understanding, implying that both men and women learn at comparable rates. Jackstadt and Grootaert, Watts, and Allgood and Walstad published studies in recent literature that produced similar findings. Although Walstad and Soper discovered that there are significant differences favorable to men in learning rates, this outcome was subsequently replicated by Becker and Walstad.","Siegfried's research suggests that there is no compelling evidence indicating women's inferiority in learning economics when accounting for additional factors affecting economic comprehension and knowledge accumulation. According to pretest-posttest designs used to evaluate economic knowledge growth, female students' initial disadvantage does not increase over time, indicating that both sexes learn at similar rates. Recent literature, including studies by Jackstadt and Grootaert, Watts, and Allgood and Walstad, has demonstrated similar results. However, Walstad and Soper found statistically significant variations in learning rates that favor males, a finding that was subsequently replicated by Becker and Walstad.","Siegfried's investigation indicates that there is no strong evidence demonstrating the inferiority of women in understanding economics when other measurable factors influencing economic understanding and knowledge accumulation are factored in.

Current literature shows similar results from research conducted by Jackstadt and Grootaert, Watts, and Allgood and Walstad. However, Walstad and Soper reported significant gender-based disparities in learning outcomes which favor males, a result that is further confirmed by Becker and Walstad in a similar study."
"Research on the influence of race and ethnicity on academic performance has been limited. Nonetheless, a few studies have been conducted to examine this matter. Evans [1992] and Harris and Kerby [1997] considered the impact of students' race and ethnicity in their analyses. Evans concluded that black students achieve lower test scores compared to white students, while Hispanics do not face any significant disadvantage. Conversely, Harris and Kerby discovered that black students are at a significant disadvantage concerning white students, and both Hispanics and Filipinos have considerably low test scores compared to whites. Although Asian students score higher than white students, the difference between them is not statistically significant. Further, Walstad and Soper [1989] found out that black students have worse performance on the TEL than other students. The US Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics also reported that a majority of blacks and Hispanics performed below average level, compared to whites, in their first national assessment of economic literacy for grade 12 students in 2007.","Although limited, some studies have focused on the impact of race and ethnicity on test scores. For example, Evans [1992] and Harris and Kerby [1997] controlled for students' race and ethnicity in their analyses. Evans found that black students tended to score significantly lower than white students, while Hispanics showed no significant disadvantage. In contrast, Harris and Kerby found that black students were at a significant disadvantage compared to white students, and both Hispanics and Filipinos had significantly lower scores than whites. However, the difference in scores between Asian and white students was not statistically significant. Additionally, Walstad and Soper [1989] found that black students' performance on the TEL was worse than that of other students. Moreover, the US Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics conducted the first national assessment of economic literacy for grade 12 students in 2007 and noted that a higher percentage of black and Hispanic students performed below the basic level compared to whites.","The influence of race and ethnicity on academic test scores has not been widely explored, but there have been some studies conducted on this topic. For instance, Evans [1992] and Harris and Kerby [1997] both considered the role of students' race and ethnicity in their analyses. Evans discovered that black students scored considerably lower than white students, while the test scores of Hispanics were similar to those of whites. In contrast, Harris and Kerby's research indicated that black students were at a significant disadvantage when compared to their white counterparts, and both Hispanics and Filipinos had significantly lower test scores than whites. Asian students, on the other hand, scored higher than whites, but the difference was not statistically significant. Walstad and Soper [1989] also found that black students performed worse on the TEL than other students. In 2007, the US Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics conducted the first national assessment of economic literacy for grade 12 students and reported that a larger proportion of blacks and Hispanics scored below the basic level than did whites."

"We persisted in our attempts to secure the backing of the districts' superintendents for the project. Ultimately, two prominent school districts, Fullerton and San Juan Capistrano, were willing to collaborate with us. Seven schools from these districts contributed to the study by enrolling 1,343 students in mandatory one-semester economics courses in the fall of 2005. No matter the sample size or financial resources available to the researchers, previous studies on economic education at the pre-college and college level have been hampered by similar sampling limitations [e.g., Walstad and Soper 1988, p. 28; 1989, p. 24]. It's worth noting that the figure of 1,343 students that we disclosed above refers to the amount of students enrolled in the classes observed on the census date.

"We opt for the TEL as our primary performance measures to gauge students' initial understanding of economics and subsequent progress. The TEL is a standardized test developed by the National Council on Economic Education and is considered the industry standard for pre-college economic literacy assessments. It includes 40 multiple-choice questions related to core concepts of micro, macro, basic economics, and international economics. We perform the evaluation twice, first as a pretest at the beginning of the semester, and then again as a post-test in the final week of the course.","Students' scores on the TEL determine their initial economics knowledge and subsequent learning, which we use as our primary performance measures.

"To examine the performance of students on the TEL test, we required data on their characteristics. We collected information about the demographics, family background, and academic performance of students using a self-designed questionnaire [Appendix A] and school records. Student race, ethnicity, and gender, primary language, working hours outside of school, study hours per week, and parents' education background were some of the data retrieved from the questionnaire. However, students' academic GPAs before the Fall 2005 semester (excluding physical education) were obtained from school records. For certain schools, we received reports of students' standardized scores in mathematics and reading. The pretest was administered to students before the mandatory economics course began, and this was their first no-formal training in economics. We administered our survey in the first two weeks of the course.","In order to study the performance of students on the TEL examination, we required information on students' attributes. We obtained this information by using a student questionnaire that we designed [Appendix A] and official school records to gather data on demographics, family background, and academic performance.

"Table 2 reveals that although insignificant, there are gender differences in pretest scores. Male students generally perform better than female students by an average of 3.5 percentage points. Walstad and Rebeck [2001b] suggest that male students who haven't received formal economic education tend to have a 4 percentage point advantage over female students. In addition, students who have taken advanced placement or honors classes have scored higher on the TEL than those who have not, a finding consistent with research by Evans [1992] and Walstad and Rebeck [2001a, b].","Gender differences in pretest scores, although small, are statistically significant according to Table 2. On average, male students outscore female students by approximately 3.5 percentage points. Furthermore, Walstad and Rebeck's [2001b] research revealed a gender gap of 4 percentage points that benefits male students without formal economic education. Lastly, students who have taken an advanced placement or honors class outperformed their peers who haven't on the TEL. Similar results have been reported by Evans [1992] and Walstad and Rebeck [2001a, b].","Table 2 exhibits that there are statistically substantial gender differences in pretest scores, with male students outscoring female students by approximately 3.5 percentage points on average. Walstad and Rebeck [2001b] found a gender gap of 4 percentage points that favors male students without formal economic education. Additionally, students who have taken advanced placement or honors courses have outperformed their peers who haven't on the TEL.

"In Table 3, Column 1, it is observed that the pretest scores of Hispanic and Asian students are substantially lower than the TEL scores of whites, which is the reference group. This finding is consistent with the results of univariate tests shown in Table 2. However, after conducting multiple regression analysis, it is evident that the white-Hispanic gap in scores has decreased significantly. The difference has been reduced from approximately 11 percentage points listed in Table 2 to about 7 percentage points in Table 3. This indicates that the factors underlying this performance gap could be related to various family background, work effort, and performance characteristics. While African American students have a big negative impact of 11.12 percentage points, the results for African American and Asian students should be analyzed with caution due to the small size of the subgroups involved.","The pretest scores of Hispanic and Asian students are significantly lower than those of white students, as found in Column 1 of Table 3. This result is consistent with the earlier univariate tests reported in Table 2. However, the performance gap between whites and Hispanic students has decreased considerably (from about 11 percentage points in Table 2 to about 7 percentage points in Table 3), as shown by the multiple regression analysis. This suggests that the inferior performance of Hispanic students might be partly explained by differences in their family background, performance ability, and work ethic. While the negative effect on African American students is substantial (11.12 percentage points), we need to be cautious about generalizing the result for Asian and African American students because of the small number of samples available.","The results presented in Column 1 of Table 3 reveal that Hispanic and Asian students' pretest scores are significantly lower than those of white students. These results align with those observed in Table 2. Conversely, when utilizing multiple regression analysis, it is evident that the white-Hispanic gap in scores is narrower (from approximately 11 percentage points in Table 2 to around 7 percentage points in Table 3). This indicates that the disparities in academic achievement between Hispanic and white students may be due, in part, to variations observed in family background, performance, and work ethic. As expected, African American students recorded a substantially unfavorable impact of 11.12 percentage points. However, the outcomes for African American and Asian students need to be interpreted with caution owing to the considerably smaller samples at hand."
"The outcomes presented in Table 3 convey an alternative version of the gender differences mentioned. As per Column 1, males have a 6.4 percentage point benefit, which is noticeably higher (83 percent) than the gender gap exhibited in Table 2. The reason for this could be that males are not performing up to the mark in academic performance factors. Regardless, males perform better than females when it comes to TEL. It implies that if we consider academic performance characteristics, the gender difference in test scores becomes more pronounced.","The results displayed in Table 3 depict a different narrative concerning the impact of gender. In Column 1, the gender effect is determined as a 6.4 percent advantage in favor of males. This discrepancy is 83 percent higher than the gender disparity indicated in Table 2. This could be because males do not perform as well as females in academic performance measures, but they seem to outperform females in the TEL. Thus, when we adjust for academic performance characteristics, the gap between male and female test scores becomes more prominent.","The gender effects reported in Table 3 present a different picture of the situation. In Column 1, the gender effect is shown as a 6.4 percentage point advantage for males. This is considerably higher (83 percent) than the gender difference stated in Table 2. One plausible explanation for this is that even though males lag behind females in academic performance measures, they still perform better than females on the TEL. Consequently, adjusting for the academic performance measures widens the gap between male and female test scores."
"According to the additional results, students who mention English as their primary language for speaking and writing can score approximately 5% higher on the pretest, while students who report living with both parents can score around 3% higher. It is no surprise that academic performance plays a crucial role in predicting a student's success on the pretest, where each one-point increase in academic GPA is associated with almost 9.12% point increase in pretest scores. Moreover, students enrolled in advanced placement economics classes tend to score almost 4% higher on the pretest. However, the variable that determines whether students have taken an AP or honors class is not significant in the pretest regressions.","The supplementary findings demonstrate that students who mention English as their primary language for speaking and writing can obtain approximately 5% higher scores on the pretest. Additionally, students who report living with both parents can achieve about 3% higher scores. As expected, academic performance plays a critical role in predicting success on the pretest: every one-point increase in academic GPA is connected to a nearly 9.12% point rise in pretest scores. Furthermore, students taking advanced placement economics classes tend to score approximately 4% higher on the pretest. Notably, the variable that tracks whether students have ever taken an advanced placement or honors class is not relevant in the pretest regressions.","The additional outcomes suggest that students who identify English as their primary language for speaking and writing can earn almost 5% higher scores on the pretest, while students who report living with both parents can score about 3% more. Not surprisingly, academic performance is a crucial predictor of success on the pretest: every one-point rise in academic GPA corresponds to a nearly 9.12% point upsurge on the pretest scores. Furthermore, students registered in advanced placement economics courses tend to score approximately 4% higher on the pretest. On the other hand, the variable that regulates whether students have ever taken an advanced placement or honors class is insignificant in the pretest regressions."
"When math and reading scores are added to the pretest regression analysis (Table 3, Column 2), it has a negligible effect on the estimated ethnicity and gender effects previously noted in Column 1. The pretest scores increase slightly over 4 percentage points with a reading score increase of ten points. The inclusion of both reading and math scores results in a decrease of the academic GPA impact from 9.12 percentage points to 7.42 percentage points. Conversely, the impact of being currently enrolled in advanced placement economics increases from 3.88 percentage points to 5.78 percentage points.","Incorporating math and reading scores into the pretest regression analysis (Table 3, Column 2) makes minimal changes to the ethnicity and gender effects estimated in Column 1. Pretest scores receive a little over 4% increase with a ten-point increase in reading scores. When math and reading scores are included, the influence of academic GPA is reduced from 9.12 percentage points to 7.42 percentage points. However, the effect of presently studying in advanced placement economics goes up from 3.88 percentage points to 5.78 percentage points.","The impact of math and reading scores on the pretest regression analysis (Table 3, Column 2) is insignificant when it comes to the ethnic and gender effects presented in Column 1. Increasing the reading score by ten points results in just over 4% increase in pretest scores.

The effect of taking advanced placement economics increases from 3.88 percentage points to 5.78 percentage points."
"The findings of our study align with previous research on factors that affect a student's economic knowledge in high school. As mentioned in the literature, multiple studies demonstrate significant gender differences, with males performing better than females, and our gender effects being even more pronounced than those reported in previous research, except for the one conducted by Heath. Similarly, academic ability, as indicated by performance in GPA or enrollment in AP courses, is a significant predictor of economic knowledge. A previous study by Jackstadt and Grootaert in 1980 found that grade level, GPA, and part-time work significantly affected students' scores. Furthermore, ethnicity has been identified as a factor, with both Hispanics and Filipinos scoring substantially lower than whites on multiple choice exams, while our study focusing on a single county provides insight into even more significant gender and ethnicity differences than previously reported, especially among Hispanic students, which may be attributable to factors peculiar to Orange County.","Our research validates previous studies that analyze the elements that contribute to a student's economic knowledge in high school. As discussed in the literature review, various studies report that gender differences exist, where males score higher than females, and our findings show this gender effect to be even stronger than previously reported, except for a study conducted by Heath. Similarly, academic competence, as quantified through GPA or AP course participation, is a significant predictor of economic knowledge. A prior investigation by Jackstadt and Grootaert discovered that factors such as grade level, GPA, and holding a part-time job affected students' scores. Furthermore, ethnicity has been shown to be a factor, with lower scores on multiple-choice tests for both Hispanics and Filipinos as compared to whites, as discovered by Harris and Kerby, with scores being 1.47 and 2.34 points lower, respectively. Our research, which focuses on one county, indicates even more significant gender and ethnicity differences than previously found, with Hispanic students showing particular differences, which may be specific to Orange County.","Our study provides confirmation to past research regarding the determinants of economic knowledge among high school students. As mentioned in the literature review, previous studies such as those conducted by Watts, Walstad and Soper, Heath, and Evans all found considerable gender differences, with males scoring higher, although our research found even more significant gender effects compared to prior studies, except for Heath's study. Similarly, academic capability, as measured by GPA or AP courses taken were significant predictors of economic knowledge. Another study conducted by Jackstadt and Grootaert found that factors such as grade level, GPA, and having a part-time job affected students' scores. Ethnicity has also been found to be a factor, with Harris and Kerby reporting lower scores by Hispanics and Filipinos on multiple-choice exams, with scores being 1.47 and 2.34 points lower than whites, respectively. Our study that focuses on a single county indicates gender and ethnicity differences are even more significant than previous research, with Hispanic students showing noticeable variations in test scores, which could be attributed to specific factors within Orange County."
"The high school students in our sample had a weak foundation in economics based on initial knowledge. Descriptive statistics show that pretest TEL scores were highest among white students (55.5%), followed by Asians (48.9%) and Hispanics (44.1%), while males outperformed females by approximately 3.5 percentage points (54.8% and 51.3%, respectively). Analysis of pretest score determinants revealed significant differences between ethnicities and gender, with Hispanics scoring slightly closer to whites when academic performance and family background characteristics were controlled.","The initial knowledge of economics among high school students in our sample was found to be lacking. Upon analyzing the descriptive statistics, it was discovered that white students yielded the highest pretest TEL scores at 55.5%, followed by Asians at 48.9% and Hispanics at 44.1%. The male population outperformed their female peers, boasting 54.8% and 51.3%, respectively. Ethnicity and gender served as significant determinants for pretest scores, with a reduction in the gap between the scores of Hispanic and white students, albeit not eliminated even after adjustments for academic performance and family background factors.","The students from high schools that were sampled in the study lacked sufficient knowledge about economics to begin with. The collected descriptive statistics showed that white students scored the highest in the TEL pretest (55.5%), followed by Asians (48.9%) and Hispanics (44.1%). The male students did better than female students by 3.5 percentage points (54.8% and 51.3% respectively). After examining the factors that contributed to the pretest scores, it was observed that ethnicity and gender played a significant role. The gap between the scores of Hispanic and white students was reduced, but not completely eliminated, after controlling for academic performance and family background characteristics."
"The gender disparities found in the pretest scores are thought-provoking. Although there is a small difference favoring males in the initial economic literacy, when taking into account the academic performance levels, the gap between males and females widens. It seems like females perform lower in economics than in other subjects. One possible reason for this could be the lack of early exposure to economic reasoning amongst young girls. Generally, the academic performance of students, like GPA or standardized mathematics and reading scores, plays a crucial role in pretest scores.","The differences in pretest scores between genders are intriguing. Although males have a slight advantage in initial economic literacy, the difference becomes more pronounced when academic performance is taken into account. Females appear to underperform in economics when compared to other subjects, which could be attributed to the lack of exposure to economic reasoning at an earlier age. Generally, pretest scores are significantly influenced by academic performance levels such as GPA and standardized mathematics and reading scores.","The pretest score gender disparities are quite interesting. Although there is a slight difference in favor of males in terms of initial economic literacy, the difference increases significantly when academic performance factors are considered. Females seem to perform worse in economics compared to other subjects, which could be ascribed to lesser exposure to economic reasoning during their early years. In general, academic performance has a significant impact on pretest scores, as demonstrated by factors such as GPA and standardized mathematics and reading scores."
"The analysis reveals that the quality of the instructors is a critical determinant of pupils' academic progress. It is documented that the effects of individual teachers are, in general, substantial and statistically significant. While it is possible that there exist unique student characteristics observable but unaccounted for that account for peer effects, the influence of teacher quality in student test scores changes cannot be understated.","The research findings demonstrate the significance of teacher excellence in shaping students' academic achievements. The outcomes show that there are substantial and statistically meaningful teacher-specific effects. Although it is feasible that there may be some common student traits by class that cause peer effects, it is the quality of the instructor that plays a crucial role in students' test score improvements.","According to the findings, teacher quality is a crucial determinant of students' learning outcomes. The research reveals that the effects of individual teachers are mostly significant and statistically noteworthy. While it cannot be entirely ruled out that there may be certain observable or unobservable student traits by classroom leading to peer effects, there is a firm belief that the quality of the teacher is of utmost importance in determining changes in students' test scores."
"Effective policy intervention according to the results should target specific ethnicities and genders. Improving economic literacy for Hispanics is linked with overall academic performance compared to whites. It is necessary to focus on improving learning opportunities in all subjects, including economics, at an early age to enhance the economic literacy of Hispanics. The difference in pretest scores between whites and Hispanics implies that early exposure to economic concepts may differ due to lower income and background characteristics. Furthermore, female students have less economic knowledge than male students at 12th grade, and this gap exists even when their overall academic performance is similar.","The findings suggest that specific intervention plans targeting certain ethnicities and genders are necessary for improving economic literacy. The results indicate that the academic performance of Hispanics compared to whites has a significant impact on their economic literacy. Therefore, enhancing learning opportunities in all subjects, including economics, at an early age could improve economic literacy for Hispanics. The difference in pretest scores between whites and Hispanics after controlling for academic performance characteristics might suggest variations in early access to economic concepts due to underlying income and community characteristics. Additionally, female students have lower economic knowledge relative to their male peers in 12th grade, regardless of their overall academic performance.","The results show the need for targeted policy interventions for specific ethnicities and genders to enhance economic literacy. The study suggests that economic literacy among Hispanics could benefit from improving overall academic performance relative to whites. To improve the economic literacy of Hispanics, it is essential to provide equal learning opportunities in all subjects, including economics, during early education. The white-Hispanic gap in pretest scores, after controlling for academic performance characteristics, implies a possible difference in early exposure to economic concepts, influenced by income and other socio-economic factors. Also, the female students' lower economic knowledge, even with similar academic performance, indicates a need for more attention to enhancing the economic literacy of female students."
"Based on our analysis of 12th graders' preliminary knowledge of economics, it appears that there remains room for improvement in fostering basic economic literacy throughout the K-11 school curriculum, although the study is geographically limited. Even though the California History/Social Science Standards have integrated an Economics Strand into the K-12 curriculum since 1998, necessitating the incorporation of essential economic principles and ways of thinking over an 11-year period culminating in a one-semester economics course during high school, it seems that economic literacy among young Californians is not particularly strong upon entering 12th grade. However, our research indicates that formal economic teaching during 12th grade does contribute to an improvement in students' economic literacy.","Drawing from our analysis of 12th graders' foundational knowledge of economics, we have found that more efforts are necessary throughout the K-11 school curriculum to cultivate basic economic literacy, although the study's area is limited. Despite the Economics Strand's inclusion in the California History/Social Science Standards across the K-12 program since 1998, which mandates introducing foundational economic concepts and the economic way of thinking over 11 years before high school graduation's one-semester economics course, our findings indicate that economic literacy among young Californians upon entering 12th grade is not robust enough. On the other hand, we observed that formal economic education in 12th grade does enhance students' economic literacy.","Our assessment of the entry-level economics knowledge of 12th graders suggests that more work is needed throughout the K-11 curriculum to build a basic understanding of economics, even though the study's geographical range is confined. Although the California History/Social Science Standards incorporated an Economics Strand into the K-12 curriculum in 1998, demanding that essential economic ideas and the economic way of thinking be infused throughout 11 years culminating in a one-semester economics course before high school graduation, we found that young Californians' economic literacy is not strong enough when they reach 12th grade. Nonetheless, we also observed that formal economic education in 12th grade improves students' economic literacy."
"Classical economists placed considerable emphasis on capital accumulation and growth. It is fair to say that this emphasis on accumulation and growth originated from Adam Smith's masterpiece, The Wealth of Nations. Scholars have widely recognized that Smith's work provides an intricate account of economic development that involves several economic forces interacting and driving a commercial economy towards progress in a dynamic process.","Capital accumulation and growth were significant concerns to classical economists. This emphasis on growth and accumulation can be traced back to Adam Smith's book, The Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. It is widely acknowledged that in this book, Smith provides a detailed and formal explanation of economic development, which involves complex economic forces interacting with each other to propel the commercial economy forward in a dynamic manner.","Classical economists placed great importance on the issues of capital accumulation and growth.

Many scholars have noted the significance of Smith's work in shaping our understanding of these concepts today."
"To fully comprehend the scope of economic evolution, it is necessary to take into account historical analysis as well. According to Smith, the study of history is essential to understanding the science of society and the human condition. By utilizing history as a tool, a cohesive social science framework can be established. Furthermore, Smith provides a historical perspective of societal growth from feudalism to the emergence of contemporary European states in Book III of the Wealth of Nations.","The issues surrounding economic evolution are multi-faceted and cannot be fully understood without considering the historical aspects. Smith believes that studying history is crucial to obtain a thorough understanding of human and societal behavior. By using history as a tool, he believes it is possible to establish a coherent social science system. Smith also provides a detailed historical account of social development in Book III of the Wealth of Nations, spanning from the decline of feudal society to the rise of modern European states.","The matters surrounding economic evolution are complex, and to gain a complete understanding of them, a historical perspective is necessary. Smith argues that examining history is an essential aspect of comprehending human and societal behaviors.

In addition, Smith presents an extensive historical account of social progress in Book III of the Wealth of Nations, which commences from the fall of feudal society to the emergence of modern European nations."
"Scientists seek to identify the mechanisms that create regularities between events and phenomena, as noted by Smith in his essay on the history of astronomy. Smith argues that the scientists' purpose is to uncover the ""connecting principles of nature"" or the ""invisible chains"" that link together different objects. In the Wealth of Nations, it is claimed that moral philosophy is the ""science that investigates and explains these connecting principles."" Smith aimed to uncover the ""chains and mechanisms"" or ""connecting principles"" that could be used to interpret social events. As a result, Smith's moral philosophy, including natural theology, ethics, jurisprudence, and economics, is often regarded as a social science system today.","According to Smith's essay on the history of astronomy, scientists endeavor to determine the mechanisms behind the event regularities that exist between phenomena. Scientists strive to reveal ""the connecting principles of nature"" or ""the invisible chains that bind together all these disjointed objects,"" as put forth by Smith. Moral philosophy is similar in that it is considered the ""science which pretends to investigate and explain those connecting principles,"" as stated in the Wealth of Nations. Smith aimed to uncover the ""chains and mechanisms"" or ""connecting principles"" that could be used to deduce information about social events. This is why Smith's moral philosophy, including natural theology, ethics, jurisprudence, and economics, is frequently described as a system of social science today.","In his essay on the history of astronomy, Smith asserts that science's goal is to recognize the mechanisms that generate event regularities between phenomena. As per Smith, scientists' mission is to uncover the ""connecting principles of nature"" or the ""invisible chains which bind together all these disjointed objects."" Moral philosophy, similarly, spotlights the ""science which pretends to investigate and explain those connecting principles,"" as stated in the Wealth of Nations. Smith tried to reveal the ""chains and mechanisms"" or ""connecting principles"" to gain insights into social events. Therefore, Smith's moral philosophy, which incorporates natural theology, ethics, jurisprudence, and economics, is generally considered a social science system nowadays."
"According to certain commentators, Smith's historical account should be viewed as a nomothetic approach to history rather than an idiographic one. This implies that history is not merely a narrative account of past events, but rather a systematic analysis of important themes beginning with a theoretical framework. As a consequence, Smith's historical discourse adopted a ""system-to-facts"" perspective, using historical evidence to substantiate his theory.","Some scholars suggest that Smith's historical account should be regarded as a nomothetic approach rather than an idiographic one. This means that history is seen as an organized analysis of significant themes rather than a mere collection of past events presented in narrative form.

"It has fascinated researchers focusing on Smith's work that he asserted in 1776 that the genuine trajectory of economic development in Europe was completely reversed, a statement that was quite striking. In fact, Smith devoted Book III's remaining chapters (chapters two to four) to explaining the causes of this deviation. As a result, some experts have argued that Smith was unable to reconcile his theoretical argument with historical experience.","Scholars have found it intriguing that Smith declared in 1776 that the actual path of economic growth in Europe was ""completely inverted,"" which was a very bold statement. Consequently, Smith analyzed the factors that led to this divergence in the remaining chapters (chapters two to four) of Book III. Some critics have since argued that Smith struggled to reconcile his theoretical argument with historical facts.",Researchers who have analyzed Smith's work have found it fascinating that he made the remarkable claim in 1776 that the actual course of economic growth in Europe was completely reversed. This led Smith to devote the remaining chapters (chapters two to four) of Book III to explaining why this divergence occurred. Some commentators have challenged Smith's ability to reconcile his theoretical argument with historical experience.
"Theoretical advancement described in the opening chapter of Book III is based on a specific economic theoretical model that supposes a number of institutional, legal, and political variables to be stationary, which is currently essential to observe for the intended purpose.","In order to fulfill the present objective, it is essential to note that the theoretical account of progress outlined in the first section of Book III is founded upon a certain type of economic theoretical model that has a series of institutional, legal, and political factors that are considered constant or presumed to be so.","It is pertinent to acknowledge, for the purpose at hand, that the theoretical narrative of progress presented in the initial chapter of Book III is established on a particular economic theoretical model which assumes a set of institutional, legal, and political conditions to be unchanging or taken for granted."
"Smith's theoretical history of economic progress encompasses a broader dimension. This dimension involves the application of the nomothetic mode, which is rooted in economic modeling, extended to a politico-economic model. This would enable the consideration of principles, such as the structure of legal rules and incentives of the polity, and their interaction with economic forces. In the Wealth of Nations, Smith explores this perspective in Book III and IV. However, the story of the theoretical history of economic change is not explicitly presented.","The theoretical history of economic progress formulated by Smith can be seen as having an additional dimension. This dimension involves a more elaborate application of the nomothetic mode, which is founded on economic modeling, and can be extended to encompass a politico-economic model. This would entail the incorporation of principles such as the legal rules and incentives structure of the polity, allowing for their interaction with economic forces. In the Wealth of Nations, Smith delves into this perspective throughout Book III and IV. Nevertheless, the presentation of this theoretical history of economic change is not immediately apparent.","Smith's theoretical history of economic progress is not limited to a singular dimension.

In the Wealth of Nations, Smith explores this perspective throughout Book III and IV. Nonetheless, the theoretical history of economic change is not immediately apparent in his presentation."
"Smith's definition of political economy does not limit itself to economic matters but recognizes the influence of political activities. He considered it to be a component of the statesman or legislator's field of knowledge or a theory of natural jurisprudence that may be referred to as the theory of the state. Natural jurisprudence aims to set out the general principles that should undergird the laws of nations, according to Smith (1759: 341).","According to Smith, political economy is not exclusively concerned with economic issues, as it is also influenced by political activities. He described it as ""a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator"" (Smith 1776: 428), or the theory of natural jurisprudence, which can be considered as a theory of the state. Smith's natural jurisprudence aimed to establish the general principles that should underpin the laws of nations (Smith 1759: 341).","Smith believed that political economy is not limited to the examination of economics but also takes into account the influence of political activities.

According to Smith (1759: 341), natural jurisprudence was intended to articulate the general principles that should serve as the foundation of the laws of nations."
"According to the observation made, Smith could have formulated a politico-economic model in economic history, in which Smith's theories of the state and positive economics play a role as sub-theories. Smith's historical account of Europe's progress demonstrates that the politico-economic model illustrates the relationship between the polity and the economy in the system. It also indicates that any governmental actions and legal institutions set up by public policy will undoubtedly influence economic performance, whether positively or negatively.","The findings suggest that Smith may have developed a politico-economic model in economic history, where his theories of the state and positive economics act as sub-theories. By analyzing the actual progress in Europe, Smith's historical account provides evidence that the politico-economic model signifies the connection between the polity and the economy within the system. Additionally, it emphasizes that governmental actions and legal institutions established through public policy will significantly impact economic performance, irrespective of whether it is advantageous or disadvantageous.","The observation made implies that Smith could have constructed a politico-economic model in economic history, where Smith's theories of the state and positive economics act as sub-theories, respectively. As per Smith's historical account of Europe's actual progress, the politico-economic model depicts the interaction between the polity and the economy in the system, and the impact of governmental actions and legal institutions established through public policy on economic performance, be it favorable or unfavorable."
"Smith was well aware that multiple forces are at play in the stagnation and advancement of wealth in the real world historical process. He frequently pointed out that elements such as defense, culture, climate, terrain, and chance can all impact economic performance and social change.","Smith understood that there are several factors that contribute to the ebb and flow of wealth in the historical process. He frequently noted that aspects such as defense, culture, climate, terrain, and fortune can influence economic performance and social transformation.","Smith was fully aware of the numerous forces that have an impact on the progress and decline of wealth in real-life historical processes. He often emphasized that factors like defense, culture, climate, terrain, and even chance can influence economic and social changes."
"Smith's 1776 publication suggests that the desire for self-improvement or self-love is an integral and constant motivator for humans. This desire is present from birth until death, while being generally calm and rational in nature. According to Smith, this innate desire is the primary impetus for individual savings and broader capital accumulation, leading to greater national income and employment growth in the long run.","Adam Smith, in his book published in 1776, states that the principle of self-love, also known as a longing to improve oneself, is an inborn impulse that remains with humans throughout their life. Smith explains that this unemotional and rational instinct is what drives individuals to pursue personal savings, contributing to overall capital accumulation at the macro level. Over time, this accumulation leads to higher national income and employment rates.","In his 1776 publication, Adam Smith discusses the principle of self-love, which is the desire to improve one's condition, noting that it is a fundamental impulse in humans. This drive is present from the time of birth until the moment of death and is generally calm and rational in nature. Smith explains that this instinct is the engine driving individuals to practice personal savings, which contributes to capital accumulation at the aggregate level. In the end, this results in higher levels of national income and employment rates."
"Smith's analysis of economic history goes beyond economic factors and includes an evaluation of institutional aspects, including political regulations, contracts, and property rights, that are governed by the state. These human institutions serve as formal boundaries to daily interaction and play a crucial role in shaping human behavior. When structured in a just and appropriate manner, property rights and a sound polity can provide economic actors with security and encourage productive use of scarce resources.","Smith takes a comprehensive approach to economic history, considering institutional factors such as political regulations, property rights and enforcement mechanisms that are under state control. Human institutions that are managed by the state act as formal limitations on daily life and are fundamental to human interaction. A well-designed polity and structure of property rights can foster economic development by encouraging individuals to engage in productive activities and make better use of limited resources.","One important aspect of Smith's analysis of economic history is his inclusion of institutional factors, such as political regulations, property rights, and contracts that are enforced by the state. These human institutions serve as formal constraints on daily life and are essential to human interaction. When designed in a fair and appropriate manner, a just polity and a structure of property rights can provide individuals with the confidence to engage in economic activities, leading to more efficient use of scarce resources and greater productivity."
"""In Book III, Chapter 2 of the Wealth of Nations, Smith discusses how Europe underwent a transition to a modern economy after the collapse of the Roman Empire.

"In order to evaluate the degree to which the institutional environment is accountable for worldwide discrepancies in economic growth and development, this research uses an innovative technique based on the institutions-augmented Solow model. The model is then used to estimate regression equations empirically. The study examines data from 180 countries between 1993 and 2012. The findings confirm that higher-quality institutional environments have a considerable positive influence on economic development, as demonstrated by all of the five institutional indicators - two economic freedom indices (Heritage Foundation and Fraser Institute), the governance indicator (World Bank), the democracy index (Freedom House), and the EBRD transition indicator for post-socialist countries. According to the study, discrepancies in human and physical capital and institutional environment account for around 70-75% of the world's differences in economic development. Nevertheless, the institutions-augmented Solow model has a weaker performance in comprehending differences in the pace of economic growth. Only one institutional variable (the index of economic freedom) has a significant effect on economic growth, according to the findings.","The aim of this study is to evaluate to what extent the institutional environment is responsible for dissimilarities in economic growth and development across the globe.

"The rate of economic growth and level of economic development are affected by diverse factors that are analyzed both from a theoretical and empirical perspective. These factors are broadly categorized into two main groups, i.e., the demand-side and supply-side determinants. Demand-side determinants comprise the elements of aggregate demand such as government expenditures, investment expenditures, and net exports. Consumption is not a self-determining factor and hence excluded. On the other hand, supply-side determinants comprise the variables, including technology, labour, human capital, and physical capital that can affect the potential output. Nonetheless, both demand-side and supply-side determinants can be sub-categorized, including various types of investments or government spending, along with other capital. These determinants are called direct because they promptly transform expenditures or inputs into output.","The pace of economic growth and degree of economic development depend on several factors analyzed by theoretical and empirical perspectives. These factors can be divided into two categories: demand-side and supply-side determinants. The demand-side group includes components of aggregate demand, such as investment expenditures, government spending on goods and services, and net exports. Consumption is not independent, so it is excluded. The supply-side determinants include variables like human capital, labor, technology, and physical capital that can influence potential output. Both determinants can be further broken down into various types of investments or government spending or capital. They are known as direct factors because they immediately transform inputs or expenditures into output.","The rate of economic growth and the level of economic development are influenced by various factors, which are analyzed through theoretical and empirical perspectives.

These determinants are called direct because they are transformed into output promptly."
Economic progress and development are reliant on both primary determinants as well as the underlying factors of production. These deep factors have a bearing on the primary determinants and thereby have an impact on macroeconomic outcomes. Institutional structures that aid in the interaction between output and measurable inputs are also considered deep determinants.,The growth and development of an economy rely not only on direct determinants but also on underlying factors of production. These deep determinants affect the direct determinants and ultimately influence macroeconomic performance. Institutional frameworks that facilitate interactions between measurable inputs and output are regarded as deep determinants.,"The economic progress and development of a nation is not only influenced by the direct determinants but also the underlying factors of production. These deep factors impact the direct determinants and hence have a bearing on the macroeconomic performance. Institution building is a critical deep determinant, as it enables the seamless interaction between measurable inputs and output to generate desired outcomes."
"The role that institutions play in economic growth and development is substantial. However, there are challenges that come with assessing the impact of institutions on economic growth, including identifying which institutions are the most essential growth factors and how to quantify them for empirical studies. The difficulty in answering these questions means that further theoretical and empirical research is needed to examine the connection between institutions and economic growth.","Institutions play a significant role in the process of economic growth and development.

"Institutions serve as a broad term that encompasses a vast range of variables. There are countless ways to define institutions, as demonstrated by Sulejewicz's 2009 study. Institutions can be viewed as the rules of the game, whether upheld by legal requirements or voluntary social norms, or as strategies utilized by dominant groups. Some institutions are informal, such as trust and loyalty, while others require coordination by lawmakers, such as limited liability corporations. Markets, in particular, require a complex system of institutions to function, including property rights, regulatory institutions overseeing industries such as goods, services, labor, assets, and financial markets, fiscal and monetary institutions, institutions for social insurance, and measures for conflict management. The latter includes the rule of law, high-quality judicial systems, representative political institutions, free and fair elections, independent labor unions, social partnerships, and representation of minority groups, as Rodrik noted in 2007.","When discussing institutions, it is essential to recognize the breadth of the term. Sulejewicz's 2009 analysis shows multiple variables used to describe different types of institutions. Persson believes that institutions represent the rules of the game, with some enforced by legal policies while others rely on voluntary agreement or influence from wealthy or powerful people. Certain institutions, such as trust and commitment, function informally, while others, like limited liability corporations, require legislative approval. The various institutions required to support functioning markets are numerous and demanding, presenting challenges for governments seeking to create a stable business environment. Institutions including property rights, regulatory institutions, fiscal and monetary policies, social insurance, and conflict management mechanisms are all critical to shaping markets. Rodrik in 2007 identified several institutions that are needed to stabilize markets, including the rule of law, impartial courts, fair electoral processes, autonomous labor unions, partnership with social entities, and minority representation.","The definition of institutions is broad, and there are countless variables that describe this term. Sulejewicz's 2009 research provides numerous concepts of institutions. Persson notes that these mechanisms represent the rules of a game, with some upheld by law, others by mutual agreement, and some by the force of dominant groups. Certain institutions operate informally, such as trust and loyalty, while others require coordinated actions by lawmakers, such as limited liability corporations. Institutions are essential for market functioning, with various institutions such as property rights, regulatory institutions, social insurance, fiscal institutions, and conflict management mechanisms needed to ensure that the market stays stable. Specific institutions such as the rule of law, independent labor unions, social partnerships, minority representation, impartial courts, fair electoral processes, and representative political institutions are all essential for markets to function effectively, as identified by Rodrik in 2007."

"In an empirical analysis, it is impractical to include all possible types of institutions. Thus, the number and type of institutional indicators must be constrained. Consequently, the study concentrates on four indices that represent different areas of institutional environment, i.e., economic freedom, governance indicator, democracy index, and transition indicator. Economic development is determined using GDP per capita at PPP, while its growth rate indicates economic growth. The study covers 180 countries, and the number of countries for each model estimation may vary based on data availability.","Including all possible types of institutions in one empirical analysis is unfeasible. Therefore, it becomes essential to introduce constraints on the number and type of institutional indicators used.

"To comply with your request, I will rephrase the provided paragraph. In this segment, we will be comparing our institutions-augmented Solow model to the Mankiw-Romer-Weil (MRW) model, which is a variant of the Solow model that incorporates human capital.

"The augmented Solow model suggests that both institutions and usual factors have an impact on economic growth, which is demonstrated by Equation (21). Economic growth will be higher with better institutions. By employing linear regression, it is possible to gauge the effect of institutions on economic growth empirically, but certain assumptions regarding the regression model and estimation techniques must be applied. The researchers Bia?owolski, Kuszewski, and Witkowski [2010] assume that all the relationships in macroeconomics are linear.","Economic growth is determined by both institutions and standard factors in accordance with the institutions-augmented Solow model, which Equation (21) illustrates. The quality of institutions is directly proportional to the rapidity of economic growth. Estimating the impact of institutions on economic growth empirically is possible by using linear regression to analyze Equation (21). Of course, some assumptions concerning the regression model's specification and estimation methods must be imposed, such as the assumption of all macroeconomic relationships being linear by Bia?owolski, Kuszewski, and Witkowski [2010].","Based on the institutions-augmented Solow model, Equation (21) reveals that economic growth is reliant on both institutions and standard factors. A higher quality of institutions correlates with a more rapid rate of economic growth. Employing linear regression to estimate Equation (21) enables us to empirically assess the impact of institutions on economic growth while adhering to specific assumptions regarding regression model specification and estimation techniques. For example, Bia?owolski, Kuszewski, and Witkowski [2010] assume linear macroeconomic relationships."
"There are alternative methods for identifying the variables that impact economic growth, and not just through the estimation of regression equations. One of these methods is growth accounting, which is an empirical exercise that calculates how much economic growth is caused by measurable factor inputs and technological changes. The residual portion of economic growth, which is called the Solow residual, is taken as a proxy of technical progress or total factor productivity. The growth accounting method cannot differentiate the contribution of institutions from other factors. The estimation of the regression equation and growth accounting follow different econometric methodologies, so we cannot compare these two methods directly. For more information on growth accounting exercises, check out studies by Rapacki and Próchniak [2006].","Aside from estimating regression equations, there exist other means of identifying the factors that influence economic growth. One such approach is growth accounting, which involves an analytical exercise dedicated to estimating the impact of measurable factor inputs and technological changes on economic growth. The Solow residual, or the portion of economic growth that cannot be attributed to these measurable factors, serves as a proxy for technical progress or total factor productivity. However, growth accounting is unable to distinguish the contribution of institutions from that of other factors. Due to the disparity in their econometric methodologies, it is difficult to compare the estimation of regression equations to growth accounting. For further information on growth accounting exercises, consider examining studies by Rapacki and Próchniak [2006].","It is not just through regression equations that we can identify the variables affecting economic growth. Growth accounting is an empirical exercise that can be used for this purpose, where the goal is to calculate the amount of economic growth that can be attributed to measurable factors such as labor, physical capital or human capital, as well as the level of technology. The Solow residual, which is the portion of economic growth not explained by these factors, is used as a measure of technical progress or total factor productivity. However, it is not possible to determine which part of the Solow residual is due to institutions versus other elements via growth accounting. Because of their different econometric methodologies, we cannot directly compare the estimation of the regression equation with growth accounting. To learn more about growth accounting, it is recommended to review studies conducted by Rapacki and Próchniak [2006]."
"Institutions have been subject to a multitude of empirical studies due to the lack of a single, definitive method for measuring them. These studies explore the relationship between institutions and economic growth or development and are too numerous to comprehensively cover in a single paper. For brevity, we provide a brief analysis of selected empirical studies in Table 1, which examine the impact of institutional environment on macroeconomic performance. Economic indicators such as economic freedom, level of democracy, and political stability feature prominently in the studies.","Numerous empirical studies have analyzed the relationship between institutions and economic growth, as there is no definitive method for measuring institutions.

"There is a plethora of analysis methods found in the literature review, encompassing various theoretical models, institutional indicators, country and time period samples, and methods of econometric modeling. Though some patterns, such as the positive effect of economic freedom on economic growth, have become apparent, there are still unanswered questions, such as whether the relationship between institutions and growth is linear or nonlinear. This indicates a need for further empirical investigation on this matter. Our study seeks to determine the effectiveness of the institutions-augmented Solow model in explaining differences in economic growth rates and levels of development and using our conclusions to estimate the macroeconomic production function.","The literature review indicates a wide variety of analysis methods, including different theoretical models, institutional indicators, country and time period samples, as well as several approaches to econometric modeling.

"In this segment, we will assess the authenticity of the Solow model, which incorporates institutions, to explicate the contrasting economic development and growth patterns realised by the countries. The analysis commences with investigating the determinants of economic development and moves forward to examine the factors that contribute to economic growth.","The purpose of this section is to validate the application of the Solow model with institutional augmentation in explaining the differences in economic growth and development across nations. The assessment will commence by identifying the contributing factors of economic development, followed by an examination of the determinants of economic growth.",This section aims to verify the effectiveness of the institutions-augmented Solow model in providing an explanation for the variances in economic development and growth observed among different countries. The analysis commences by examining the essential factors that determine economic development before shifting the focus towards the factors that account for economic growth.
"Table 2 data shows that the institutions-augmented Solow model is highly effective in explaining income level differences across the world. Regardless of the institutional indicator used, all regression equations had high R-squares, and estimated coefficients were consistent with theoretical analysis and expectations. For instance, variant A revealed that physical capital accumulation, human capital accumulation, population growth, and economic freedom (measured by the Heritage Foundation index) explain approximately 75% of global economic development disparities, with all variables being statistically significant except for population growth, which had a positive sign despite contradicting theory. Switching to the Fraser Institute's economic freedom index as the institutional indicator yielded comparable outcomes, with physical capital becoming insignificant while human capital and institutions remained significant. Variant C, which used the World Bank's world governance indicator as the institutional variable, produced similar results to variant B except that physical capital was entirely insignificant.","According to the data in Table 2, the institutions-augmented Solow model is extremely successful in explaining economic disparities across the globe. Irrespective of the institutional indicator, all regression equations had high R-squares, and the estimated coefficients were consistent with the theoretical analysis and expectations. For example, variant A showed that around 75% of worldwide economic discrepancies could be explained by differences in physical capital accumulation, human capital accumulation, population growth, and the range of economic freedom (as measured by the Heritage Foundation index). All explanatory variables were statistically significant, except for population growth, which had a positive sign albeit contradicting theory. When the institutional indicator was changed to the Fraser Institute's index of economic freedom, the results were similar, with human capital and institutions remaining important while physical capital did not. Variant C, which used the World Bank's world governance indicator as the institutional variable, produced results similar to variant B, with physical capital being entirely insignificant.","As per Table 2 data, the institutions-augmented Solow model is exceptionally effective in explaining differences in income levels globally.

The results were similar when the institutional indicator changed to the Fraser Institute's economic freedom index, with human capital and institutions remaining significant while physical capital became insignificant. Variant C, which used the World Bank's world governance indicator as the institutional variable, produced outcomes close to variant B, with physical capital being completely insignificant."
"Theoretical analysis suggests that there is a negative link between the rate of economic growth and the initial GDP per capita level, supporting the idea of convergence. The catching-up effect facilitates income equality among nations. Additionally, physical capital, human capital accumulation, and institutional factors are positive indicators of economic growth. Conversely, population growth has a negative correlation with output dynamics.","The relationship between the rate of economic growth and the initial GDP per capita level is negative based on theoretical analysis, indicating the existence of convergence. The catching-up effect that occurs leads to a decrease in income differences between countries, contributing to income equality. Furthermore, physical capital, human capital accumulation, and institutional factors have a positive impact on the rate of economic growth, while population growth has a rather negative impact on output dynamics.","As per theoretical analysis, there is a negative correlation between the rate of economic growth and the initial GDP per capita level, which points towards convergence. The catching-up effect is responsible for the reduction of income disparities among nations. Moreover, physical capital, human capital accumulation, and institutional factors are affirmative factors for economic growth. However, population growth has a rather adverse relationship with output dynamics."
"The Solow model extended for institutional variables outperforms differences in economic growth rates in explaining global differences in economic development. This is due to the fact that institutional variables, investment rates, and human capital accumulation, impacting potential output in a significant way, relate to the supply side of the economy. Meanwhile, economic growth rates are influenced mainly by many demand-side factors, and other forces which do not reflect fluctuations in potential output. Institutional variables have long-lasting effects on economic development, resulting from the long-term behavior of a given economy that institutional variables can explain. At the same time, economic growth rates do not reveal long-run tendencies. Therefore, institutional variables may provide a weak explanation.","The Solow model augmented with institutional variables is a better way of explaining differences in economic development worldwide than differences in economic growth rates. This is because variables like institutional environment, investment rates, and human capital accumulation, which fall under the input category, are associated with the economy's supply side and have a profound influence on potential output. In contrast, economic growth rates are a product of various demand-side factors and external variables that do not reflect the changes in potential output. Institutional variables have an extended impact on economic development primarily due to the behavior of a given economy over the long term that they can explain. Conversely, economic growth rates cannot show long-term tendencies. Hence, the Solow model extended for institutional variables is a better explanation of the differences in economic development than GDP growth rates.","The institution-augmented Solow model is a more effective tool for explaining differences in worldwide economic development than the dissimilarities in economic growth rates. This is because variables like investment rates, institutional environment, and human capital accumulation related to inputs, impact the supply-side of the economy and hold a significant power of influencing potential output. Conversely, numerous demand-side factors and other external variables impact economic growth rates, which do not effectively reflect fluctuations in potential output. Institutional variables have long-term effects on economic development, as it results from the long-term behavior of an economy that institutional factors can explain. Besides, GDP growth rates fail to reveal long-run tendencies, which suggests that institutional variables may provide a weak explanation. Therefore, the institution-augmented Solow model is better suited to explain differences in economic development than differences in GDP growth rates."
"When interpreting the results, it is assumed that past values of explanatory variables impact the current state of development, however, several macroeconomic relationships exist due to mutual causality triggered by the endogenous nature of some variables. For example, rich countries may have more opportunities to save, invest in human capital, and have favorable regulations and institutions simply because they are wealthy. To explore endogeneity, it is required to conduct a more comprehensive analysis using advanced econometric techniques, which might be an appropriate topic for further research.","The interpretation of results presumes that the past explanatory variables affect the current level of economic development. However, mutual causality characterizes several macroeconomic relations, and this is partly attributable to the endogenous character of some variables. Wealthy countries could enjoy greater opportunities to save, invest in human capital, and benefit from favorable regulations and institutions due to their wealth. However, an endogenous approach would require more extensive analysis and the adoption of more advanced econometric methods, which could be the subject of further investigation.","In interpreting the results, it is assumed that the past explanatory variables have a causal relationship with the current stage of economic development. However, several macroeconomic relationships have mutual causality, which is caused in part by some variables' endogenous nature. For instance, richer countries may have more exceptional opportunities for saving, investing in human capital, and benefiting from regulations and institutions that support their economic growth. Further research would require a more in-depth analysis and more advanced econometric techniques to study the endogenous approach effectively."
"The above equations provide slightly contradictory outputs. The first one highlights the important role of human capital in economic development, whereas the latter assigns more value to physical capital growth. This could be due to the fact that the former equation was derived from the determinants of economic development, wherein human capital serves as a significant factor. Economic advancement is an outcome of long-term economic growth, which is majorly influenced by how much human capital has been accumulated over the past few decades. Therefore, nations that possess an abundance of human capital tend to achieve higher levels of economic development.","The formulas above appear to produce slightly inconsistent outcomes. While the first one underscores the critical role played by human capital in driving economic growth, the second formula places greater emphasis on the accumulation of physical capital. This apparent contradiction could be explained by the fact that the first formula was established based on the determinants of economic development, which highlights the centrality of human capital. The level of economic well-being is ultimately a product of long-term economic growth, which is closely tied to the extent of human capital accumulation over the preceding decades. For this reason, countries that have ample human capital tend to achieve higher levels of economic development.","The above equations seem to present slightly contradictory findings. The first formula emphasizes the crucial role of human capital in the process of economic development, while the latter assigns greater importance to physical capital accumulation. However, this discrepancy could be due to the first equation being derived from the determinants of economic development, where human capital plays a more significant role. Economic well-being is primarily the result of the long-term growth process, which largely depends on the accumulation of human capital over the past few decades. Hence, countries with abundant human capital tend to achieve higher levels of economic development."
"In the context of medium-term economic growth, physical capital plays a more critical role compared to human capital. Investment in physical capital leads to immediate acceleration of economic growth, while the effects of human capital accumulation take a longer time to manifest. Therefore, physical capital is considered to be a more significant factor in the process of economic growth. This view is also supported by some models of economic growth such as the Uzawa-Lucas model, which suggests that the pace of economic development of a given developing country depends on whether the country is lagging in physical capital or human capital.","When it comes to medium-term economic growth, physical capital tends to be more crucial than human capital. Investing in physical capital assists in immediately boosting economic growth, while the effects of human capital accumulation take longer to become apparent. As a result, physical capital is considered to be a more significant variable in the process of economic growth. This perspective is supported by some models of economic growth, such as the Uzawa-Lucas model, which suggests that the pace of economic growth of a developing country largely depends on whether the country is deficient in physical capital or human capital.","In medium-term economic growth, physical capital appears to play a more significant role than human capital. Investing in physical capital results in an immediate acceleration of economic growth, while the effects of human capital accumulation take a longer time to materialize. Therefore, physical capital is deemed a more critical factor in the process of economic growth. This viewpoint is also supported by some models of economic growth, including the Uzawa-Lucas model. This model posits that the pace of economic growth in a developing country primarily depends on whether the nation lags in physical capital or human capital."
"The role of institutions in determining GDP is crucial, regardless of the model adopted. The institutional elasticity of output generally ranges from 0.55 to 1.05, which signifies the importance of institutions in shaping the economy. Additionally, most of the individual models support this idea.","Irrespective of the model used, the findings suggest that institutions play a crucial part in shaping GDP. The institutional elasticity of output tends to be either 0.55 or 1.05 on average, highlighting the fundamental role of institutions in the output determination. Furthermore, the majority of the individual models validate this perspective.","The results indicate that, regardless of the model employed, institutions are critical in determining GDP. On average, the institutional elasticity of output is 0.55 or 1.05, which underscores their significant influence on the economy. Moreover, most of the individual models confirm this perspective."
"In our research, we delved into the concept of an economic man, which holds a prominent role in economic ethics. Our primary focus was to understand the economic behavior of people and to explore the hypotheses made by traditional economics around the economic man. We were guided by the Christian economic man models of M. Weber and S. N. Bulgakov in our examination of business ethics and economic ethics. Instead of exploring multiple pathways, we focused on Weber and Bulgakov's characterization of economic man to scrutinize the hypothesis of a rational economic man. Besides, we debated the arguments made by L. von Mises and A. Sen on the nature of an economic man's freedom and personality. One of the critical issues scholars studying business ethics and economic ethics must tackle is how to blend the egoism and altruism found in an economic man's heart to create more altruistic economic agents.","Our study delved into the concept of an economic man, which plays a significant role in economic ethics. Through our research, we aimed to investigate the economic behavior of individuals and the hypotheses about the economic man in traditional economics, drawing upon the Christian economic man models of M.

Instead of exploring various approaches to business ethics and economic ethics, we chose to scrutinize the notion of a rational economic man based on Weber and Bulgakov's definition. Additionally, we discussed the claims made by L. von Mises and A. Sen on the essence of an economic man's freedom and innermost being. Scholars interested in economic ethics and business ethics must address the issue of reconciling altruism and egoism commonly inherent in the heart of an economic man to generate more altruistic economic individuals.","Our study examined the idea of an economic man as a central figure in economic ethics, with a focus on understanding human behavior in economic situations and exploring the hypotheses around the economic man in traditional economics. Drawing inspiration from the Christian economic man models of M. Weber and S. N. Bulgakov, we chose to scrutinize the hypothesis of a rational economic man, using their definitions as a guide. Instead of exploring other channels, we investigated L. von Mises's and A. Sen's contentions on the substantive freedom and internal makeup of an economic man. Scholars of business ethics and economic ethics must explore how to reconcile egotism and altruism that coexist in the hearts of economic agents to drive more altruistic economic behavior."
"In the late 1800s, China faced the challenge of the capitalist powers of Europe and America and the influence of Western civilization. When China was unable to counter Western military power in the form of ships and guns, it began to take note of the advantages of laws and institutions in Western capitalist countries. This led to a realization of how these changes would impact China's cultural heritage and civilization. To reconcile Confucianism with the demands of capitalism and democracy, Neo-Confucianism reimagined the traditional concept of 'external enrichment.' Likewise, those who sought to westernize Russia in the early 1900s faced challenges in reconciling the inherent culture of Russia with Western civilization. As Russia moves into the 21st century with a 'westernized' capitalist market economy, the challenges of promoting a mature democracy and reconciling Western civilization with Russian culture remain to be fully addressed. This is an area of study that is deserving of academic attention.","During the late 1800s, China faced a formidable challenge from the capitalist powers of Europe and America as well as the impact of Western civilization.

"There were several studies during the 1950s that contributed to the research techniques used at that time, conducted by researchers such as Pye (1982), Mead (2001), Almond and Verba (1963), Lipset (2001), McClelland (1987), and others. During the 1970s and 1980s, with the boom in the economy of the Four Asian Tigers, consisting of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan, several Asian countries began adopting Confucian culture. This led to scholars like Landes (1998), Fukuyama (1995), Huntington (1993), Porter (1990), Radelet, and Sachs (1998), focusing their research on the role of Confucian ethics and culture in economic development. Since the 1990s, there has been an increasing interest in studying the interaction between culture and economic/political development. Russian culture, influenced heavily by the Eastern Orthodox Church's religious culture and ethics, requires more research into how it interacts with economic development, as there have been few studies on this subject. It would be interesting to study the operation of Russian-style capitalism, influenced by the Eastern Orthodox Church's culture based on ethical considerations.","Researchers such as Pye (1982), Mead (2001), Almond and Verba (1963), Lipset (2001), McClelland (1987), among others, made significant contributions to research techniques used in the 1950s. The economic rise of the Four Asian Tigers, comprising Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan, triggered the adoption of Confucian culture in several Asian countries from the 1970s to the 1980s. This, in turn, sparked scholars like Landes (1998), Fukuyama (1995), Huntington (1993), Porter (1990), Radelet, and Sachs (1998) to investigate the relationship between Confucian ethics and culture in economic development. The study of the interaction between culture and economic/political development has since become a trending subject. Although the Chinese culture's major source is Confucian ethics, the religious culture, and ethics of the Eastern Orthodox Church, deeply impacted Russian culture. However, few studies have examined the interplay between Russian Orthodox ethics culture and economic development. It is vital to research the operation of Russian-style capitalism influenced by Eastern Orthodox Church culture rooted in ethical considerations.","In the 1950s, various researchers, including Pye (1982), Mead (2001), Almond and Verba (1963), Lipset (2001), McClelland (1987), and others, made notable contributions to different research approaches.

Since then, culture and economic/political development have been heavily researched. While Confucian ethics are a major foundation of Chinese culture, Russian culture is highly influenced by Eastern Orthodox Church's religious culture and ethics. However, there have been only a few studies conducted on the relationship between Russian Orthodox ethics culture and economic development. As such, examining the operation of Russian-style capitalism influenced by Eastern Orthodox Church culture rooted in ethical considerations is an essential area for further research."
"The objective of this research is to utilize Amartya Sen's economic ethics theory as a tool for analyzing and developing the capitalist market economic ethics of Russia. In doing so, the economic ethics of Protestantism and the Eastern Orthodox Church will be compared to form the foundation of Russia's market economic ethics. The Russian Orthodox Church's culture and tradition had a profound influence on the country's development, as recorded in A. Leroy-Beaulieu's 'The Empire of the Tsars and the Russians' and J. F. Hecker's 'Religion under the Soviets,' in which the Russian people were referred to as 'apostles of God' and 'those who yearn for God.'","To develop the capitalist market economic ethics of Russia, this study attempts to employ Amartya Sen's economic ethics theory as an analytical tool while comparing the economic ethics of Protestantism and the Eastern Orthodox Church.

"Bulgakov was a well-known Russian Orthodox theologian who distinguished himself from other theologians by his expertise in economics. He taught Marxist economics at both the Lomonosov Moscow State University and the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv before becoming an Orthodox priest in 1918. However, his political views led to his expulsion by the Soviet government in 1922, and he was forced to flee to Paris, France, where he founded the Institute Saint-Serge and taught courses on dogmatics until his death in 1944. Bulgakov's interdisciplinary background allowed him to explore various topics, including Orthodox ethics, alternative economic systems, and economic development based on M.

"Bulgakov was raised as an Orthodox Christian in a family of Russian Orthodox priests. However, in high school, he turned into an atheist and a Marxist, becoming a known specialist of Marxism with the publication of his monograph on ""Production in a Capitalist Market"" in 1896. After returning from Western Europe in 1901, Bulgakov was influenced by the philosophies of Kant and Schelling and began questioning Marxist economics. This led to the publication of his Master's thesis on ""Capitalism and Agriculture,"" which explored the contradiction between the rule of concentrated production and rural production. Bulgakov then underwent a transformation, embracing the belief that human life and society were built on absolute values such as truth, goodness, and beauty, and published ""From Marxism to Idealism"" in 1903 to explain his ideological shift. Bulgakov revealed that he initially saw himself as a pure social scientist, but he was compelled to explore concepts of righteousness, truth, and the existence of God when investigating the foundation of the social system. Hence, he became interested in researching the link between Christian ethics and the economy or society, which became a major focus of his work.","Born into a family of Russian Orthodox priests, Bulgakov was raised as a devout Orthodox Christian.

"Bulgakov delved into the concept of a human-like deity and examined fake Christianity in both materialistic atheism and Marx's socialism. He drew parallels between the predictions for socialism's rise and the destiny of capitalism with the end times prophecies in Christian theology. He likened the proletariat to God's chosen people and assigned them with specific callings, while portraying capital as Satan. In his essays, 'Pristine Christianity and Last Socialism' and 'Apocalypse and Socialism,' written in 1909 and 1910 respectively, Bulgakov discussed these ideas in-depth (Lossky 1952, pp. 200–202). Bulgakov argued that Marx's socialism, which was labeled an atheist pseudo-religion, was centered around a self-righteous man-God. This man-God portrayed himself to be like Christ or a saint and was hostile to Christianity and God-man saints. However, this portrayal differed from that of Christian economic man, who had a unique personality and soul, according to Bulgakov's ethical beliefs.","Bulgakov continued to explore the idea of man having divine qualities and scrutinized the properties of pseudo-Christianity, particularly in materialistic atheism and Marx's socialism. For instance, he found similarities between the prophecies for the development of socialism and capitalism's fate with Christian eschatology as in the Apocalypse. Similarly, he equated the proletariat with God's chosen people, possessing specific vocations, while capital symbolized Satan's power. In his essays, 'Pristine Christianity and Last Socialism' (1909) and 'Apocalypse and Socialism' (1910), Bulgakov delved deeper into these concepts (Lossky 1952, pp. 200–202). Based on Bulgakov's economic ethics, he argued that Marx's socialism, viewed as atheistic pseudo-religion, portrays a self-righteous man-God who sees themselves as a Christ-like figure or a saint while rejecting Christianity and God-man saints. In contrast, Christian economic man is a unique individual with a distinguished personality and soul.","Bulgakov explored the concept of a man-God and examined the characteristics of pseudo-Christianity that are present in materialistic atheism and Marx's socialism.

"The dissertation titled 'The World as Household' by Bulgakov explored the human behavior in an economic context, in addition to the idea of an economic man. Bulgakov's central focus was on the relationship between labor and the realistic world in economic activities. He believed that the economy acted as a bridge connecting the realistic world and a living person, which a dead person lacking the ability to communicate with cannot access. In a Christian perspective, rebirth and immortality enabled a person to continue consuming in the realistic world. Production was viewed as the right and obligation of an individual to work in the realistic world (Bulgakov 2000; Valliere 2000, pp. 253–278).","In Bulgakov's dissertation, 'Philosophy of Economy: the World as Household,' not only was the concept of an economic man examined but also the economic behaviors of humans.

"Sen pointed out that economic progress is dependent on the level of freedom individuals are entitled to.

"Christianity values the idea of human freedom, and this is upheld in various divisions such as Catholicism, Protestantism, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Whenever the concept of human freedom is discussed, questions like 'Who is man?' and 'What is the relationship between man and God?' often arise. Christianity uses 'Imago Dei' from the book of Genesis in the Old Testament to explain who man is, where human characteristics such as free will, morality, and rationale are used to describe man's image of God and the unique relationship that exists between God and man. Karl Rahner, a Catholic theologian, believes that man is the recipient of the Word of God, 'Ho ?rer des Wortes,' which explains the link between God and man. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether man's mirror image of God, which was harmed by Adam, can be recovered through salvation or whether it emerged after Original Sin with some parts unaffected and others damaged.","The concept of human freedom holds great significance in Christianity and its various factions like Catholicism, Protestantism, and the Eastern Orthodox Church.

"Luther emphasized the importance of faith when faced with limited freedom and uncertainty. Having faith allows Christians to believe in their own salvation and pursue their goals without coercion or pressure to perform sacred deeds for the sole purpose of pleasing God or gaining recognition from Him. Those who lack faith are seen as troubled and unhappy. Thus, salvation can only be achieved by wholeheartedly waiting for God and fully trusting Him while abandoning self-directed activities. It is only after redemption that man can be truly free to serve God.

"Sen's economic development theory centers around the connection between human freedom and advancement. As per Sen, genuine liberation empowers people to realize their abilities and improve their skills to secure a place in a profession or social group, such as doctors, soldiers, volunteers, etc. Sen refers to this standing as 'being,' which varies from Weber's religious ideas of 'calling' or 'Beruf.' Weber put forth that Calvinist Puritans aimed to become Berufsmenschen by following austerity and reforming the world to serve God's kingdom. Weber believed that capitalists could efficiently use the productivity of voluntary workers to boost labor productivity. However, with the ascent of capitalism and the replacement of human workers with machines, the ascetic practices of the Beruf concept declined while wealth acquisition grew in importance, devoid of any religious or moral implications. Thus, the Beruf concept that gave birth to capitalism faced its demise because of its replacement by capitalism.","The theory of economic development proposed by Sen establishes a direct relationship between human freedom and advancement. Sen believes that human beings can reach their full potential and develop their abilities once they possess true freedom.

This concept differs from Weber's religious notions of 'calling' or 'Beruf.' Weber argued that Calvinist Puritans sought to become Berufsmenschen, who, through austerity and reform, answered God's calling and worked for the Kingdom of God. Weber further believed that capitalists could exploit the voluntary productivity of workers to achieve the highest possible labor force productivity. However, with the emergence of capitalism and the replacement of human labor with machines, the idea of Beruf slowly collapsed, with a focus on wealth acquisition, divorced from spiritual and ethical considerations. As a result, the Beruf concept that gave birth to capitalism eventually lost its relevance in post-Enlightenment society.","Sen's theory of economic development explores the link between human freedom and progress. According to Sen, once an individual discovers true freedom, they can unlock their potential and utilize their skills to become a member of a particular profession, group, or social status such as doctors, soldiers, volunteers, and more. Sen defines this status and identity as 'being,' which differs from Weber's religious interpretation of 'calling' or 'Beruf.' Weber established that Calvinist Puritans aimed to become Berufsmenschen by following asceticism and reforming the world to serve God's kingdom. In addition to this, Weber believed that when an employer has highly productive voluntary workers at their disposal, they can utilize capitalist 'labor productivity' effectively.

As a result, the concept of Beruf slowly declined, eventually losing its power to influence society in capitalist societies."
"Bulgakov believed that man was essential to the creation of the economic world and viewed him as the Logos. He believed that an individual's asceticism and dedication to their profession had a significant impact on the world. Hence, he suggested that merging a person's role as a Logos in the economic world with asceticism could improve labor productivity. Bulgakov's concept of 'homo economicus' differed from Calvinist's 'Berufsmensch' in that the former had an ascetic nature and only existed as an identity of Logos. The 'Berufsmensch,' on the other hand, saw his work as a lifelong mission from God and believed that his diligence and dedication would earn him eternal life. By collaborating with the Holy Spirit to deify the world, man played a crucial role in governing it after its creation.","According to Bulgakov, man played a central role in creating the economic world, and he believed that man was the Logos. Bulgakov proposed that asceticism, which is one of the hallmarks of Christian religion, and the Logos man played could be merged to create a new economic man. This new breed of worker was motivated by labor mechanisms that led to an increase in productivity. In contrast to the Calvinist 'Berufsmensch,' Bulgakov's 'homo economicus' was an ascetic entity that existed only as an identity of the Logos. Meanwhile, the 'Berufsmensch' considered his work a calling and saw it as a lifetime mission from God. Through the collaboration and bond between man and the Holy Spirit, the world could achieve deification, and man would take an active role in governing the world after Creation.","Bulgakov, who believed that man was the creator and Logos of the economic world, proposed merging the concepts of asceticism and the role of man as the Logos. This blend led to the emergence of a new 'homo economicus' who was motivated by a new labor mechanism, which increased productivity. In contrast to the Calvinist 'Berufsmensch' who saw himself as the chosen one, believing that his work was a calling that God bestowed upon him, Bulgakov's 'homo economicus' only existed as a Logos identity with an ascetic nature. The man collaborated with the Holy Spirit to deify the world and governed it after Creation through the sacrament of God. In conclusion, the distinction between the two concepts was evident, and man's cooperation with God played a significant role in the world's progress."

Their responsibility, assigned by God, is to govern, create, and undertake labor rights and obligations aligned with God’s mission of world divinization. From this perspective, ""instrumental freedoms"" that provide economic convenience, and basic human and economic rights, including free trade in the market, are beneficial. Consequently, for Russia's overall economic growth, utilizing Sen's five ""instrumental freedoms"" to create a supportive environment that safeguards freedom could be highly rewarding."
"The connection between human economic behavior and an economic system was explored through an analysis of Bulgakov's Christian economic man, which was further supported by Sen's arguments. Other topics examined included human freedom in theology, God's calling to humans, predestination, justification, mysticism, deification and economic ethics within a specific economic system. Furthermore, the study also delved into Weber's concept of man working in a calling, specifically within the context of Lutheranism and Calvinism.","The correlation between human economic behavior and an economic system was analyzed by exploring Bulgakov's views on Christian economic man, alongside Sen's arguments. Additionally, the study investigated several theological concepts such as human freedom, God's calling, predestination, justification, mysticism, deification, and economic ethics within a specific economic system. Weber's perspective on man working in a calling under Lutheranism and Calvinism was also considered during the research.","The relationship between human economic behavior and economic systems was studied by examining Bulgakov's perspective on Christian economic man in conjunction with Sen's arguments. The research also involved investigating various theological concepts like human freedom, God's calling, predestination, justification, mysticism, deification, and economic ethics within a specific economic system. In addition, the study explored Weber's concept of man working in a calling within the framework of Lutheranism and Calvinism."
"Bulgakov's rejection of Marxism was reflected in his statements on the concept of the economic man during 1903-1911. His later works, such as 'Philosophy of Economy', and other essays drew inspiration from Weber's concept of a Christian economic man. Bulgakov explored the idea of Christian economic men from various denominations, including Catholicism, Orthodox Church, Puritan, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Quakers. However, despite these discussions within theology, this concept did not receive much attention compared to the traditional economic view of the economic man. The lack of attention suggests that there is a scope for new research in this area.","According to the text, Bulgakov's sentiments towards Marxism were conveyed through his views on the economic man during the period of 1903-1911. His subsequent works, like 'Philosophy of Economy', were influenced by Weber's concept of a Christian economic man. Bulgakov discussed different interpretations of the Christian economic man within the context of various Christian denominations, which included Catholicism, Orthodox Church, Puritan, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Quakers. However, this theological viewpoint did not get as much attention as the traditional economic interpretations of the economic man. Therefore, there is an opportunity for future research in this field that could offer a different perspective.","The text states that Bulgakov's rejection of Marxism can be seen in his views on the concept of the economic man between the years 1903 to 1911. Bulgakov's later works, such as 'Philosophy of Economy', were definitely inspired by Weber's idea of a Christian economic man. Bulgakov discussed various interpretations of the Christian economic man in the context of different Christian faiths, including Catholicism, Orthodox Church, Puritan, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Quakers. Nevertheless, this theological perspective on the concept did not get much attention in comparison to the traditional economic view of the economic man. This suggests that there is room for new research in the area and an opportunity to offer a different perspective."
"Von Mises's explanation of a human being's economic behavior is more holistic and includes not only the rational and self-interest qualities of the standard economic man, but also their innermost being or soul, which is highlighted in his analysis of free will in Chapter 3 and economic behavior in Chapter 1 (von Mises, 2006). This aspect is crucial for a comprehensive comprehension of economic behavior. Bulgakov's Christian economic man and Weber's man driven by their vocation, known as the Calvinist economic man according to Bulgakov, are analogous to von Mises's economic man in terms of incorporating spiritual elements in the analysis.","Despite Sen's attempts to move the economic man from a rational and self-interested being to a liberated economic man, his work does not delve into the soul or innermost essence of an economic man, as detailed in von Mises's analysis of human economic behavior in Chapter 1 and free will in Chapter 3, which is a vital attribute in examining economic behavior (von Mises, 2006). Conversely, von Mises's depiction of the economic man is more akin to Bulgakov's Christian economic man and Weber's individual who labors with a defined purpose and is regarded as a Calvinist economic man.","von Mises's approach to analyzing a human being's economic actions encompasses not just the rational and self-interested aspects of the typical economic man, but also includes their innermost being or soul, which is highlighted in his examination of free will in Chapter 3 and economic behavior in Chapter 1, and is a key aspect of comprehending economic behavior (von Mises, 2006). The spiritual component of economic behavior is illustrated further by Bulgakov's Christian economic man and Weber's man who strives for a specific purpose in their work, known as the Calvinist economic man from Bulgakov's perspective, and is consistent with von Mises's depiction of the economic man."
"The relationship between religious ethics and an economic man in an economic system has been a focus of both Bulgakov and Weber. Weber gave importance to the effects of Calvinist economic ethics on an economic man, and Bulgakov went on to explain the concept of an economic man in Christianity. Moreover, both authors have emphasized the soulless existence of economic man. Bulgakov argued that a materialist economic man in Marxism would have no soul, while Weber stated that many people working in the last stage of capitalism had lost their Protestant ethics and became soulless.","The correlation between an economic system, an economic man, and religious ethics has attracted significant attention from both Bulgakov and Weber. While Weber placed emphasis on the impact of Calvinist economic ethics on the economic man, Bulgakov expanded the concept to include an economic man within Christianity. They both referred to the idea of a soulless economic man, with Bulgakov contending that a materialistic economic man in Marxism would lack a soul, and Weber arguing that in the final stage of capitalism, only soulless individuals, having abandoned Protestant ethics, would work in a calling or profession.","The concept of an economic man in an economic system and its relationship with religious ethics is a topic that has garnered much attention from Bulgakov and Weber. Weber focused on the influence of Calvinist economic ethics on the economic man, which Bulgakov expanded upon to introduce the idea of an economic man in Christianity. Both authors addressed the notion of a soulless economic man, with Bulgakov asserting that a materialistic economic man in Marxism would lack a soul, while Weber believed that those who had lost their Protestant ethics during the last stage of capitalism would become soulless."

"The passage I will rewrite is closely related to the text provided by the human.

"The question of computation and calculation is of utmost importance in the context of the economic system. The economic calculation problem has a direct impact on institutional settlements and policies. Various institutional structures can serve as obstacles to achieving rational allocation of resources through economic calculation. For this reason, the outcome of the economic calculation debate carries significant weight. When experts like economists and philosophers define institutions and policies, they must take into account the possibility of computation and calculation in an economic system.","The ability to perform computation and calculation in economic systems is highly practical and essential. Institutional settlements and policies are significantly influenced by the economic calculation problem. Various institutional structures can potentially limit the possibility of economic calculation and result in irrational resource allocation. The outcome of the economic calculation debate is critical from this perspective. Therefore, when economists and philosophers design institutions and policies, they must take into consideration the ability to perform computation and calculation within an economic system.","The practical significance of computation and calculation in the economic system is immense. The economic calculation problem has a crucial impact on institutional settlements and policies. Different institutional settings can pose hindrances to economic calculation, leading to irrational allocation of resources. Hence, it is crucial to consider the conclusions of the economic calculation debate. When economists and philosophers outline institutions and policies, they must recognize the importance of computation and calculation in an economic system to make informed decisions."
"Computability theory is concerned with whether economic issues can be resolved through it. We tend to think that modern computing devices have boundless power for calculation and that they can solve any problem if given enough resources and time, including economic problems.","In economic theory, computability focuses on whether the problems at hand can be addressed using principles of computability. Given the seemingly infinite capacity of modern computing devices for computation, it is sometimes assumed that any problem can be solved with adequate time and resources, including the economic problem.","Computability theory in economics deals with the feasibility of solving economic problems using computability principles. Although modern computers have seemingly limitless calculation abilities, we cannot always assume that economic problems can be solved with sufficient resources and time, despite their vast computational capacity."
"The issue we refer to as the economic problem pertains to how resources ought to be rationally allocated in an economic system. This dilemma is prevalent among all individuals, even those leading self-sufficient lifestyles, as the number of needs and wants generally exceed the available resources at hand. The most compelling instance of this issue is that of time. Since time is scarce for all of us, it's crucial to allocate it in a manner that prioritizes the importance of our objectives.","The economic quandary at hand deals with the wise allocation of resources within an economic framework. This perplexity is ubiquitous among all people, irrespective of whether they lead self-sufficient lives or not, as demands and necessities usually outnumber available resources. The issue of the judicious allocation of time provides an excellent example of this predicament, as this limited resource must be allocated according to the essential goals one has set.","The economic problem necessitates the rational allocation of resources within an economic system. Each individual, regardless of their self-sustaining lifestyle, must grapple with this issue because requirements and desires are often in higher demand than the resources available. The most noteworthy example of this is the management of time, which is a scarce resource. Allocating time in a rational manner means prioritizing objectives based on their importance."
"Von Mises contends that economic calculation remains impossible in an economic system based on collective property, despite the availability of all relevant information to the planner. He assumes that the planner is equipped with complete technological know-how of their current time and has a full inventory of production factors, and various experts have furnished them with exhaustive reports. Furthermore, all individuals in society have agreed to common ends. Yet, the planner still faces a conundrum - the infinite range of means and projects at their disposal renders it almost impossible to determine the most efficient way to fulfill the common ends. For example, building a house requires choosing from multiple methods, each with varied advantages and disadvantages, such as production time, resource consumption, and quality of materials. The planner must weigh and evaluate disparate variables such as labor, tool productivity, and resource consumption to determine the optimal approach, making it an almost impossible task.","Von Mises makes a proposition that economic calculation is impossible in an economic system founded on collective property, regardless of whether the planner has access to all the pertinent information. He supposes that the planner is equipped with complete technological knowledge of the time and has an inventory of all production factors, along with exhaustive information reports from multiple experts. Additionally, all members of society have agreed upon common ends. Yet the planner still encounters a seeming insurmountable obstacle - the abundance of means and projects at their disposal can make choosing the most effective way to fulfill the common objectives impossible. What's more, building a house, for instance, necessitates picking from numerous methods, each with its set of benefits and drawbacks in terms of material quality, production time, and resource consumption. It is imperative to weigh various variables such as labor, tool productivity, and resource consumption to come to an optimal conclusion, a near-impossible feat.","Von Mises argues that economic calculation is unfeasible in an economic system anchored in collective ownership, despite the planner's possession of all relevant information. He assumes that the planner has complete technological expertise of the period and an inventory of all production factors, in addition to exhaustive data from experts, while all the individuals in society have agreed upon common objectives. Nonetheless, the planner faces a daunting task - the immense pool of means and projects available renders selecting the most efficient way to achieve the common objectives practically impossible. Take the example of constructing a house - the planner must choose from an array of methods, each with its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of factors such as production time, material quality, and resource consumption. One must weigh variables such as labor, tool efficiency, and resource consumption to arrive at an optimal conclusion, which is an immensely complex undertaking."
"In a sophisticated economy, the production techniques are exceptionally diverse. The ways of production are not wholly specific nor wholly non-specific. If every technique of production were one or the other, then determining the mode of production and the techniques to be used would be purely a technological problem instead of an economic one. Even in a simple economy, making a wise selection between heterogeneous methods and ways of production would be possible only within certain constraints. In a complex economy, the primary challenge does not involve deciding on the final goods to be produced. Even in a socialist economy, this is a lesser issue. It can be roughly established whether 1,000 hl of wine is preferable to 800 hl of wine or whether 1,000 hl of oil is better than 500 hl of oil. After this resolution is reached, the real, unsolvable difficulty (for a planned economy) arises, which is choosing the most efficient ways and techniques of production to achieve the desired ends (von Mises, 1990, p. 13, 207-8).","A complex economy is characterized by an extensive range of production methods. The production means are neither entirely specific nor entirely non-specific. If every production means falls into one of these two categories, the decision about the method of production and the means to be used would be a technological problem rather than an economic problem. Even in a simple economy, choosing between diverse production means and methods has some limitations. In a complex economy, the main challenge is not determining which goods to produce. In a socialist economy, this problem is relatively uncomplicated. Deciding whether 1,000 hl of wine is better than 800 hl of wine or if 1,000 hl of oil is superior to 500 hl of oil can be approximately agreed on. However, the actual difficulty, which is unsolvable for a planned economy, materializes when choosing the most advantageous production means and techniques to achieve the desired goals (von Mises, 1998, pp. 207-8, 13).","An intricate economy consists of a wide variety of production methods. The production means are not entirely specific or entirely non-specific. If every means of production were merely one of the two, deciding on the production method and means would be a technological issue rather than an economic one. Even in a simple economy, picking between diverse production methods and means has some limitations. In a complex economy, the primary challenge does not lie in choosing which goods to produce. In a socialist economy, this issue is not very complicated. Ultimately, it can be decided if 1,000 hl of wine is better than 800 hl of wine, or if 1,000 hl of oil is optimum compared to 500 hl of oil. Nonetheless, the actual difficulty that cannot be resolved in a planned economy emerges while selecting the most beneficial means and production methods to fulfill the objectives (von Mises, 1998, pp. 207-8, 13)."
"Market prices play a crucial role as they enable rational decision-making when it comes to choosing the best production means and methods from a wide range of available options. This is fulfilled by monetary calculation based on market prices which are created within a private property system, where entrepreneurs require goods and bid for them, be it intermediate ones or final products. This, in essence, is regarded as the ultimate solution to the economic challenge of resource allocation.","The value of market prices can't be understated since they enable logical decision-making when it comes to picking the best production means and approaches from a wide array of choices available. This is made possible via monetary calculation which relies on market prices created within a private property system, where entrepreneurs are in charge of bidding for the goods they require, be it intermediate or final ones. In a nutshell, this approach is viewed as the ultimate solution to the economic problem of resource allocation.","Market prices hold significant importance as they enable comprehensive decision-making when it comes to choosing the ideal production methods and means from numerous options available. This is executed via monetary calculation that relies on the market prices formed within a private ownership system, where entrepreneurs compete to bid for the goods they require, whether intermediate or final products. Ultimately, this framework is deemed as the ultimate resolution to the economic dilemma of resource allocation."
"Both Abba Lerner and Oskar Lange acknowledged the importance of market prices in economic calculation, while questioning the necessity of a free market based on private property to achieve such calculation. They argued that planners can replicate any market outcome, making the notion of private property redundant in this regard. In support of market socialism, Lange's papers of 1936 and 1937 suggested that three types of data are necessary for economic calculation - individual preferences, prices, and knowledge about available resources. One key difference between Lange and von Mises is their approach to price determination. Lange believed that prices can be established by analyzing individual preferences and information about available resources, while von Mises saw price determination as possible only in a market-based economy that is founded on private property ownership.","Abba Lerner and Oskar Lange recognized the significance of market prices in economic calculation, but they rejected the idea that a free market based on private property was a prerequisite for economic calculation. Instead, they argued that planners could imitate any market outcome, thus rendering private property unnecessary. Lange's support for market socialism was highlighted in his 1936 and 1937 papers, which claimed that three factors - individual preferences, prices, and knowledge about available resources - are essential for economic calculation. A key contrast between Lange and von Mises is the way they approach price determination. Lange believed that prices could be determined by gathering data on individual preferences and resource availability, using a trial-and-error method or a Tatonnement solution to find equilibrium. In contrast, von Mises opined that private property-based market economies were the only systems in which price determination could occur.","Abba Lerner and Oskar Lange recognized the crucial role of market prices in economic calculation, but they disputed the idea that a free market based on private property was a prerequisite for this process. According to their argument, planners could replicate any market outcome, rendering private property unnecessary. In his papers of 1936 and 1937, Lange advocated for market socialism, maintaining that three things - individual preferences, prices, and knowledge about available resources - were fundamental for calculation purposes. The way in which Lange and von Mises differed on this point was most evident in their approaches to price determination. Lange believed that prices could be established by analyzing individual preferences and resource availability, using either a trial-and-error process or a Tatonnement solution to attain equilibrium. In contrast, von Mises believed that price determination was possible only in a market economy that was grounded in private property rights."
"Lavoie's revision of von Mises's socialism critique suggested that market socialism advocates don't nullify the arguments that von Mises proposed. Lange's solution presupposed a Walrasian model of static general equilibrium, which was not the suitable framework that von Mises and Austrians designated for the problem of economic calculation regarding the dynamic adjustment and discovery of the continuously shifting circumstances like technologies and preferences. Although von Mises never denied the calculability of socialism in a static situation, it is irrelevant to real-world situations where economic calculation is impossible due to the socialist economy's collective form of properties. So, the computation argument becomes downplayed, and the problem remains unsolvable, as the equations cannot be set up from the beginning.","Lavoie (1981) sought to revise von Mises's critique of socialism, stating that the advocates of market socialism do not invalidate von Mises's argument. Von Mises and Austrian economists perceived the entire problem of economic calculation on a different framework, emphasizing the dynamic adjustment and discovery that occurs amid the continuously changing circumstances such as preferences and technologies. Lange's solution presupposed the Walrasian model of static general equilibrium, which von Mises considered unsuitable for economic calculation. According to Lavoie, von Mises never denied that economic calculation could work in static settings, but this is not the case in the real world. Economic calculation is not achievable in a collective economy because the equations cannot be formulated from the outset. Hence, the computation argument is downplayed.","In the context of the revised version presented by Lavoie (1981), the critique of socialism by von Mises remains unaffected by the stance of market socialism advocates. Lange's solution was based on the Walrasian model of static general equilibrium, which von Mises deemed inappropriate, as it did not consider the dynamic adjustments and discoveries that occur due to various changing factors like technologies and preferences. According to Lavoie, von Mises acknowledged the possibility of economic calculation in socialist economies in static conditions but realized that such conditions are rare in the real world. In a collective economy, the problem of economic calculation is not primarily due to the sheer volume of equations to be solved but rather to the inability to establish the equations from the beginning. Lavoie's view relegates the computation argument to a less significant position in the debate."
"In the following section, we shall analyze a recent disagreement on the boundaries of computability in an economic system that is dependent on central planning and collective property ownership. The debate revolves around Robert Murphy's adoption of a revised stance in the economic calculation debate. Murphy presented a new argument to reinforce his theory that computational models can't solve the economic problem in principle (Murphy, 2006). However, Cottrell et al. held a standard perspective in the economic calculation debate and opposed Murphy's argument.","In the next section, we will delve into recent deliberations surrounding the limitations of computational power in an economic system grounded in central planning and collective property ownership. Robert Murphy, who took on a revised position during the economic calculation debate, articulated a fresh argument that maintains the principle which suggests that computational models could never solve the economic problem (Murphy, 2006). However, Cottrell et al. (2007a, b) upheld the standard position in the economic calculation debate and challenged Murphy's proposed argument.","The upcoming section will examine a recent debate noting the boundaries of computational capability in an economic system dependent on central planning and collective ownership. Robert Murphy adopted a modified stance in the economic calculation debate and presented a new argument supporting the thesis that it is impossible to solve the economic problem with computational models in principle (Murphy, 2006). In contrast, Cottrell et al. (2007a, b) stuck to the standard position in the debate and refuted Murphy's argument."
"Murphy emphasizes that his argument is not a one-step process. He highlights that entrepreneurs continue to innovate in the market process, leading to an ever-expanding list of goods to be produced. To mimic such a market process, a central planning unit must consider all potential future goods and commodities that may emerge in the market, including intermediate goods. As a result, the central planner must possess a corresponding list of prices for all end products, as well as implicit prices of intermediate goods required for the production of consumer goods.","The argument presented by Murphy is not a straightforward one. He emphasizes that entrepreneurs are continuously innovating in the market process, which leads to an ever-evolving list of goods that need to be produced. Therefore, to replicate this market process, the central planning unit must consider all potential products and commodities that might appear in the future, including intermediate goods. To do this, the central planner must have a corresponding list of prices for all final products as well as implicit prices for the required intermediate goods that are necessary for the production of consumer goods.","Murphy's argument is not a straightforward one as it involves multiple steps. He emphasizes that entrepreneurs consistently innovate in the market process, resulting in an ever-growing list of goods that must be produced.

Thus, the central planner must maintain a corresponding list of prices for all final products as well as implicit prices for intermediate goods that are required to produce consumer goods."
"Hunter (1996) explains that demonstrating the uncountable infiniteness of prices can be facilitated by referring to Cantor's diagonal argument, which is also used to establish the existence of an uncountable set.","To establish the notion that prices are uncountably infinite, Hunter (1996) recommends an analysis of Cantor's diagonal argument which is commonly utilized to prove the existence of an uncountable set.","Using Cantor's diagonal argument to demonstrate the existence of an uncountable set, Hunter (1996) suggests that this technique can also be employed to explain why prices are infinitely uncountable."
"Cottrell and colleagues (2007a, b) argued against the claim made by R. Murphy regarding the uncountability of market prices and the infiniteness of the set. According to Cottrell et al., commodities are produced from a finite amount of other commodities, and their basic components are composed of a finite number of atoms. Hence, every commodity can be represented by a unique integer identifier based on a Godel number, which takes into account the number of atoms of each element the commodity contains. The researchers concluded that since all possible commodities can be enumerated, the set of commodities must be finite and countable. Therefore, based on their argument, the set of corresponding prices must also be countable.","Cottrell and colleagues (2007a, b) disagreed with the argument put forth by R. Murphy that the set of market prices is infinite and uncountable. They asserted that as every commodity is made up of a finite amount of other commodities, and raw materials consist of a finite number of atoms, the total number of commodities must also be countable. To give every commodity a unique identifier, they suggested representing each commodity through a Godel number that takes into account the number of atoms of each composition element. Cottrell et al. concluded that all potential commodities are enumerable, indicating that the set of commodities must be both countable and finite. Consequently, they argued that, based on this reasoning, the set of corresponding prices must also be countable.","Cottrell and colleagues (2007a,b) disputed R.Murphy's claim that the set of market prices is infinite and uncountable. They argued that since commodities are produced from a finite number of other commodities, and raw materials are built of a finite number of atoms, the count of all commodities should also be finite and countable. To provide commodities with a unique identification number, they proposed using Godel numbers that take into account the number of atoms comprising each composition element to represent every commodity archetype. The researchers concluded that since all possible commodities can be counted, the set of commodities must be finite and countable. In light of this argument, they asserted that the set of correlated prices must also be countable."
"Cottrell et al. (2007a, b, p. 3) brought up an intriguing matter regarding the endless amount of prices that exist in a market economy. They point out that individuals do not need to factor in all possible prices when making economic decisions, as doing so would render the economic calculation problem unsolvable. Therefore, it remains unclear why Murphy is insisting that a central planning unit must consider all possible prices, goods, and services, including those that have not yet been invented.","The issue of infinite uncountable prices in a market economy was raised by Cottrell et al. (2007a, b, p.3). They emphasize that individuals do not need to take into account all possible prices for successful economic decision-making since considering every option would leave the economic calculation problem unsolvable. Hence, the reasoning behind Murphy's insistence that a central planning unit should consider all possible prices, goods, and services, including those that have yet to exist, remains unclear.","Cottrell et al. (2007a, b, p.3) posed a compelling question regarding the notion of infinite uncountable prices in a market economy. They argued that individuals do not need to take every conceivable price into account to make profitable economic decisions. In fact, considering every possible price point would make the economic calculation problem impossible to solve. Therefore, it is unclear why Murphy is pressing for a central planning unit to consider every conceivable price, good, and service, even those that might not exist yet."
"The motivation to take into account all possible prices extends beyond the innovation problem and relates to the nature of private property within a market economy. In a market economy, individuals express their preferences through their possessions and the exchanges they make. However, their exchanges are limited since they can only exchange what they have, resulting in a finite set of preferences. In contrast, in a society with collective forms of property, the individuals can express an unlimited number of preferences, which the central planning unit must take into account. If the planner attempts to mimic market processes, they must consider all the infinite preferences of individuals, resulting in an infinite set of prices that aligns with the subjective value theory.","The requirement to take all possible prices into account stems not only from the innovation problem but also from the concept of private property in a market economy. In such a system, individuals express their preferences through market exchanges but are limited by the finite amount of possessions they have to exchange. On the other hand, in a society based on collective forms of property, individuals' preferences are nearly infinite, and the central planning unit must consider them all. To mimic market processes, the planner must account for all virtually infinite individual preferences, resulting in an infinite set of prices that wholeheartedly correlates with the subjective value theory.","Murphy argues that the necessity to consider all feasible prices is not only driven by the innovation problem, but is also a result of private property in a market economy. In a market economy, individuals express their preferences through their assets and the exchanges they make. However, since they possess only a finite amount of things to exchange, they cannot undertake an infinite number of exchanges. This renders the set of preferences of individuals on the market as a finite set. In contrast, in a society that has collective property forms, the individuals' preferences are not restricted. They can express as many preferences as they want, which the central planning unit must consider. To mimic market processes, the planner must take into account all the virtually infinite preferences of individuals, resulting in an infinite set of prices that aligns with the theory of subjective value."
There is a single lingering issue that demands clarity: we failed to provide a direct response to the first question posed. Is the list of prices actually infinite and uncountable? Our answer mainly focused on highlighting the fact that the potential collection of individual preferences has no bounds. This is a result of the absence of any constraints on individuals when it comes to expressing their preferences.,"There is one outstanding matter that requires further attention: we have yet to address the initial question in a straightforward manner. Is the list of prices genuinely an uncountable, infinite list? However, we did emphasize the fact that the pool of conceivable individual preferences is immeasurable since there are no restrictions on individuals expressing their preferences.","The first question remains unanswered - is the list of prices truly infinite and uncountable? Instead, we mainly highlighted the fact that individual preferences have no limit, making the potential range of preference sets infinite. Since individuals can express their preferences fully without any constraints, there is no way to restrict the pool of conceivable preferences."
"The use of Cantor's diagonal argument demonstrates that the set of prices the planner needs to consider is not only infinite but also uncountable. To begin with, each good and its price are defined using equations and sets or subsets of preferences. It is also assumed that there is an infinite set of potential preferences of individuals (p1, p2...pn). By employing the technique of changing each ""Yes"" to ""No"" and each ""No"" to ""Yes"" diagonally, it is possible to define a new subset of preferences that have never been listed before. Therefore, although there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all potential preferences and the natural numbers, there is no such correspondence between the set of all subsets of preferences and the natural numbers. As a result, the number of subsets of preferences for defining prices of goods is an uncountable, infinite set (Table III).","Cantor's diagonal argument can establish that the set of prices that the planner needs to consider is not simply infinite but also uncountable. The initial step is to define each good and price using equations and sets or subsets of preferences. Secondly, it is assumed that the possible preferences of individuals form an infinite set (p1, p2...pn). Following these premises, a subset of preferences that is distinct from all other pre-existing and future subsets can be established. By changing ""Yes"" to ""No"" and ""No"" to ""Yes"" diagonally, a new subset of preferences never listed before can be produced. Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all possible preferences and natural numbers, but there is no such correspondence between the set of all subsets of preferences and natural numbers. As a result, the number of subsets of preferences used to determine the prices of goods is an uncountable, infinite set (Table III).","The application of Cantor's diagonal argument allows for the proof that the set of prices the planner must account for is not only infinite but also uncountable. The initial assumption is to define each good and its price through equations with sets or subsets of preferences. Furthermore, the possible preferences of individuals are considered an infinite set (p1, p2...pn). Using the method of changing ""Yes"" to ""No"" and ""No"" to ""Yes"" diagonally, a new subset of preferences never before listed can be defined. Thus, while there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all potential preferences and the natural numbers, there is no such correspondence between the set of all subsets of preferences and natural numbers. As a result, the number of preferences subsets used to determine prices of goods is an infinite, uncountable set (Table III)."
"The problem of the infinite uncountable set of preferences cannot be solely resolved by the consumer goods market, even if the consumer preferences are limited in number. This difficulty persists because the preferences of managers and entrepreneurs belong to an infinite uncountable set. In some instances, the products provided by managers and entrepreneurs don't meet the specific requests of consumers. For instance, the making of the movie named The Matrix by the Wachowski brothers was not triggered by customer demands. Additionally, the investment preferences of entrepreneurs are always limited by the available capital they possess. Furthermore, if there's a central planning unit involved in a planned economy, it still encounters difficulties when determining the prices of intermediate products. This is a result of the central unit having to consider an infinite uncountable set of prices for intermediate products while making their decisions.","Even if we assume that the consumer preferences are finite, the market for consumer goods alone is not equipped to tackle the problem of the infinite uncountable set of preferences. This is because the preferences of entrepreneurs and managers exist within an infinite uncountable set. On the market, entrepreneurs and managers may provide products that aren't specifically in demand by consumers. As an illustration, the creation of the movie, The Matrix, by the Wachowski brothers wasn't a result of a particular consumer request. Similarly, the investment preferences of entrepreneurs are restricted by their available capital. In a centrally planned economy, the central planning unit would still have to face the challenge of defining prices for intermediate goods by considering an infinite uncountable set of prices.","The issue of the infinite uncountable set of preferences cannot be solved by the consumer goods market alone, even if we consider the set of consumer preferences to be finite. Entrepreneurs and managers have preferences that are still part of an infinite uncountable set. Quite often on the market, entrepreneurs and managers provide products that cater to the needs and desires of consumers that they have not explicitly expressed. For example, the Wachowski brothers created the movie, The Matrix, without any specific demand from the consumers. Investment preferences of entrepreneurs are limited by the amount of capital they own, and in a planned economy, a central planning unit still has to determine a price for intermediate goods, which is not an easy task due to an infinite uncountable set of prices."
"In the discussion regarding economic calculation, Lange contended that the central planner must depend on market prices for consumer goods to deduce the prices of intermediate goods. However, von Mises argued that this approach would not work because the planner would face the same difficulties at the intermediate goods level. According to von Mises, intermediate good prices are not established by technical means as the production factors are neither entirely specific nor entirely non-specific. Several approaches can be used to create final products using intermediate goods. Although the prices of intermediate goods may rely on individual preferences for final products, entrepreneurs set prices by bidding different quantities of intermediate goods. Entrepreneurs use market prices for intermediate goods to locate the most profitable solution. For this reason, the central planner will face comparable problems at the intermediate goods level that they previously encountered with consumer goods.","In the classical debate on economic calculation, Lange proposed that the central planner should rely on market prices for consumer goods to calculate the prices of intermediate goods. However, von Mises rebuked this idea, arguing that it would not solve the issue since the planner would confront the same obstacle at the intermediate goods level. According to von Mises (1990), the prices of intermediate goods were not determined through technical methods since production factors were neither entirely specific nor entirely nonspecific. There are several potential ways to produce final goods utilizing intermediate goods. While the prices of intermediate goods might be partially based on consumers' preferences for final goods, entrepreneurs ultimately establish these prices by bidding for different amounts of intermediate goods. The use of market prices helps entrepreneurs choose the most profitable options. As a result, the central planner will encounter similar problems when handling intermediate goods, as they formerly did when dealing with consumer goods.","The classical economic calculation debate involved Lange's proposal that the central planner must rely on market prices for consumer goods to determine the prices of intermediate goods. However, von Mises refuted this notion, stating it did not address the issue as the planner would face similar complications at the intermediate goods level. According to von Mises, the prices of intermediate goods could not be established through technical methods as production factors were neither entirely specific nor entirely nonspecific, and several ways existed to produce final products through intermediate goods. Even though the prices of intermediate goods may partially hinge on individual preferences for final goods, entrepreneurs ultimately fix them by bidding different quantities of intermediate goods. Entrepreneurs use market prices for intermediate goods to identify the most profitable strategy. As a result, the central planner will confront a similar set of difficulties at the intermediate goods level as they confronted with consumer goods."
"We have revised and reformulated Murphy's arguments to ensure accuracy, drawing on Cantor's theorem from set theories. As a result, we argue that a computational model in a planned economy must account for an uncountably infinite set of equations and prices. This leads us to the conclusion that the central planner's biggest challenge is not computing the large number of equations involved, but rather the impossibility of initially setting up all the necessary calculus equations. Consequently, we maintain that computational models are unable to simulate the market process.","Our paper refines and reformulates Murphy's arguments by incorporating Cantor's theorem from set theories. Our thesis is that a computational model in a planned economy must consider an uncountably infinite set of equations and prices. Accordingly, the central planner's main difficulty would not be in computing the many necessary equations, but in setting up all the calculus equations initially. Based on this premise, we contend that computational models are insufficient in replicating the market process.","In this paper, we have refined and reformulated Murphy's arguments through the application of Cantor's theorem from set theories. Our thesis posits that in a planned economy, a computational model must account for an uncountably infinite set of equations and prices. This implies that the central planner's biggest challenge would be the inability to set up all the required calculus equations in the first place, rather than the vast number of equations they need to compute. Consequently, we maintain that computational models cannot replicate the complexities of the market process."
"The fundamental aspect of the economic calculation debate is the understanding of how prices are formed, which is influenced by the different theories of value. Therefore, the presuppositions regarding value are crucial in this debate. However, Cottrell and his colleagues failed to take into consideration the true view of value and price formation in the Austrian School of Economics, while making their objections. Thus, all their significant objections to Murphy's (2006) theses were rejected.","The economic calculation debate centers around the conception of price formation, which is fundamentally influenced by divergent theories of value. Given this, the presuppositions concerning value are critical in the economic calculation debate. Cottrell and colleagues' opposition failed to acknowledge the genuine Austrian School of Economics perspective on value and price formation. Consequently, we have dismissed all substantive objections they formulated in response to Murphy's (2006) theses.","Understanding price formation is a fundamental aspect of the economic calculation debate, as it is linked to different theories of value.

"This study investigates the significance of economic expectations on various political attitudes in the backdrop of the global economic crisis that occurred between 2008 and 2009. The research emphasizes the critical role of information on evaluations during severe economic downturns. Unlike prior studies conducted during stable economic times, this research accounts for the impact of media exposure and content on changes in economic evaluations. Accurate news exposure exhibited a substantial influence on the anticipated development of the national economy, while individual economic expectations appeared to be largely independent of media exposure. This research further highlights the fact that the strength of the media influence increases with increased media dependency. The study concludes with a discussion on the divergence between personal and national economic evaluations in the context of mass-mediated economic information.","This study delves into the significance of economic expectations in relation to a range of political attitudes with a focus on the 2008-2009 global economic crisis. The research highlights the importance of accurate information in shaping evaluations during times of severe economic instability. In contrast to earlier studies that have examined these issues during stable economic times, this study looks into the impact of media coverage and exposure on changes in economic evaluations. The findings reveal a strong relationship between media exposure and expectations regarding the future of the national economy, while personal economic expectations appear to be less influenced by media exposure. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the influence of the media is amplified in cases of high media dependency. The study concludes by discussing the differences between personal and national economic evaluations with respect to media-driven economic information.","This study explores the significance of economic expectations and their impact on a range of political attitudes in the context of the 2008-2009 worldwide economic crisis. The research emphasizes the importance of accurate information in shaping evaluations during times of severe economic instability, which differs from prior research that focused on evaluations during more stable economic periods. The study examines the effect of media exposure and economic news coverage on changes in economic evaluations using a three-wave panel study and a content analysis of media coverage. The results show that media exposure strongly influences expectations regarding the future development of the national economy while being less related to personal economic expectations. The results also indicate that media dependency amplifies the effect of media exposure on evaluations. Finally, the study highlights the differences between personal and national economic evaluations in relation to media-driven economic information."
"Citizens' expectations regarding the economy are based on their knowledge of economic activities, which can be influenced by personal experience, communication with others and the media, among other factors. The article centers on the impact of the media in shaping economic expectations during times of crisis, specifically on the kinds of economic expectations that are affected. The authors question whether new information affects perceptions of an individual's economic circumstance or the overall economic health of a country. Since the media usually reports on the economic status of large-scale social groups, the research focuses on how the media influences national economic assessments, though personal economic expectations are also considered. The media is expected to largely influence assessments of the national economy, according to previous studies.","Economic expectations of citizens rely in part on their understanding of the economy, which can be affected by multiple factors like personal experience, communication with others, and the media. The article centers on how media coverage of economic prospects during times of crisis influences changing economic expectations. The study attempts to determine the kinds of economic expectations influenced by the mass media, whether it is just the overall economic health of the country or also the perception of one's personal economic situation. While most media coverage focuses on the economic state of a nation or large social groups, the research concentrates on assessing the impact of the media on national economic evaluations based on prior research.","Citizens' economic expectations are partly based on information about the economy, which can be influenced by factors such as personal experience, interpersonal communication, and media coverage. This study primarily focuses on the impact of the media on changing economic expectations during times of crisis and which specific economic expectations are affected. The authors seek to determine if the media influences personal economic expectations, perceptions of the entire country's economic situation, or both. The study concentrates on the media's impact on national economic assessments due to its tendency to report on the economic state of a nation or large social groups. Previous studies have shown that mediated information plays a predominant role in shaping evaluations of the national economy."
"This study focuses on exploring the influence of information on evaluations and offers a conservative estimate of its impact over time. In this regard, it considers previous research on political communication highlighting how media effects can vary across different audience groups. By integrating media content and survey data, the study provides a refined understanding of the relationship between economic media coverage and citizens' assessments. Furthermore, it investigates the potential moderating effect of news dependency on the impact of media on political belief.","The primary objective of this research is to examine how evaluations change over time and to estimate the impact of information in a cautious manner. To achieve this, the study draws on existing literature in political communication and investigates whether media effects vary across different segments of the audience. Using a blend of media content and survey data, the study refines the understanding of the relationship between economic media coverage and citizens' assessments. The study also explores the potential moderating role played by news dependency in shaping the impact of media on citizens' evaluations of political and economic events.","This study endeavors to investigate the impact of information on evaluations and provide a conservative estimation of the changes over time. It draws on prior research in political communication, which suggests that media effects may differ in terms of their intensity across different segments of the audience.

Additionally, the study explores the potential role of news dependency in moderating the impact of media effects on citizens' evaluation of political and economic events."
"This paragraph discusses the significance of examining citizens' economic expectations during unstable economic periods, which has received minimal attention in existing literature focused on established democracies. The study delves into economic perceptions during times of rapid decline, contrasting with the previous research centered on stable economic developments. In times of economic crisis, individuals are susceptible to uncertainty about their economic prospects, which they often deal with by seeking information. Mass media becomes crucial in these scenarios as heightened media coverage during challenging economic times emphasizes the importance of accurate and timely economic information.","The core theme of this paragraph revolves around exploring citizens' economic expectations in established democracies, specifically during periods of economic stability examined by existing literature. The present study takes a different approach by examining economic perceptions during times of rapidly deteriorating economic prospects, a topic largely overlooked in prior research. During economic crises, people tend to experience uncertainty regarding their economic situation, leading them to seek relevant information. Due to the intensified media coverage during adverse economic times, the role of mass-mediated economic information becomes even more significant than usual.","The central argument of this paragraph revolves around scrutinizing citizens' economic expectations in established democracies, particularly during periods of relative economic stability analyzed in current literature. Conversely, this study proposes investigating economic perceptions during times of rapid economic decline, which has received little attention in previous research. During economic crises, individuals often experience uncertainty about their economic future, leading to information-seeking behavior to mitigate this uncertainty. Furthermore, the increased coverage of economic adversity by the media during these times may magnify the importance of accurate and easily accessible economic information."
"Citizens are not always expected to have complete information regarding economic matters according to Rational choice theorists, and they are ""rationally ignorant"" about current events in general (Downs, 1957). However, empirical research indicates that citizens, particularly during election periods, have substantial insight into economic topics such as their country's unemployment rate (Paldam and Nannestad, 2000). Nevertheless, there are several reasons why citizens' beliefs may differ from the actual state of affairs (Hetherington, 1996). Kinder et al (1989) suggest that each citizen uses different standards when assessing how the economy is doing. Furthermore, citizens' partisanship may have a biasing effect, with citizens likelier to view the economy more favorably when their party is in power (Kramer, 1983; Wlezien et al, 1997; Van der Eijk et al, 2007). Lastly, in this study, the focus is the role of the mass media as a significant information source for citizens when forming their judgments regarding the economy.","Rational choice theorists contend that it is not rational for citizens to consistently possess complete knowledge about the nation's economic status, and similar to general affairs, they are ""rationally ignorant"" (Downs, 1957). Despite this, some citizens do have a considerable understanding of economic issues, specifically during election periods, such as unemployment rates (Paldam and Nannestad, 2000). However, various factors can cause citizens' perceptions to differ from the reality of economic conditions, including different evaluation standards among citizens (Kinder et al, 1989), partisanship (Kramer, 1983), and whether their preferred party is in power (Wlezien et al, 1997; Van der Eijk et al, 2007). The present study focuses on the role of the mass media as a crucial information source for citizens when forming their assessments about the economy.","According to Rational choice theorists, citizens are not expected to have complete knowledge about the state of the economy permanently. They are ""rationally ignorant"" regarding general affairs (Downs, 1957). However, various studies indicate that citizens do have a certain amount of knowledge regarding economic matters, particularly the country's unemployment rate during election periods (Paldam and Nannestad, 2000). Nonetheless, different reasons can cause citizens' beliefs to deviate from the reality of economic conditions, including citizens using different evaluation criteria (Kinder et al, 1989), partisanship (Kramer, 1983), and citizens' perceptions being more favorable towards their preferred party when in power (Wlezien et al, 1997; Van der Eijk et al, 2007). This study focuses on the mass media's main role as an information source when it comes to citizens' perceptions and evaluations of the economy."
"Studies on the political effects of the economy often revolve around the subjective economy, which reflects the evaluations and perceptions of citizens towards the economy. Early research interest focused on the role of mass media in shaping economic voting behavior rather than objective markers, which proved successful in explaining voting behavior and election outcomes. This raised concerns about a possible disconnect between the perceived and actual state of the economy. Studies that investigated this phenomenon in contexts like the 1992 US Presidential election, 2001 UK General election, and 1998 German Bundestag election revealed that perceived economic situations played an essential role in electoral outcomes. Hetherington's finding that negative mass-media coverage didn't stop Clinton's victory in the US 1992 Presidential election illustrated this point.","In studies examining the political impact of the economy, researchers often place emphasis on the subjective economy - the way in which individuals perceive and make judgments about the economy. Previous research in this area has explored the mediating role of mass media in shaping economic voting behaviour. This research has highlighted that subjective evaluations of the economy are often more effective than objective measures in explanation voting behaviours and election outcomes. As a result, there may be a disconnect between individuals' perceptions of the economy and the actual state of the economy. Examples such as the 1992 US Presidential election, the 2001 UK General election, and the 1998 German Bundestag election demonstrate this. For instance, negative mass media coverage failed to prevent Clinton's victory in 1992. Instead, a positive perception of the economy played a more significant role in the election outcome.","The subjective economy - citizens' evaluations and perceptions of the economy - constitutes a crucial element of research on the political impact of the economy. Early studies on the role of the mass media in the economic voting model identified a distortion between the subjective and the real economy. Researchers found that subjective assessments of the economy were more effective in explaining voting behaviour and election outcomes than objective measures. This observation led some to question the impact of media coverage on political decision-making. For example, research by Hetherington found that despite negative reports on the economy in the mass media, the US economy had recovered before the 1992 presidential election. This suggests that Clinton's success was built not on the actual state of the economy but on the public's perception of it. Other studies, such as the 2001 UK General election and 1998 German Bundestag election, also showed the importance of the subjective economy in shaping political outcomes."
"The impact of media on economic assessments has been primarily studied at a macro-level. Mosley's (1984) investigation revealed that media estimates of the economic situation were a significantly better predictor of economic assessments than official economic indicators. Sanders et al. (1993) and Goidel and Langley (1995) also discovered that the tone of economic news coverage affects public assessments in the United Kingdom and the United States, respectively. However, only negative news coverage has a significant influence on public evaluations, according to Soroka's (2006) more recent analysis, which is consistent with Ju's (2008) findings. On the other hand, some studies, such as Haller and Norpoth's (1997) and Wu et al.'s (2000), did not find any noteworthy impact of economic news on assessments.","Studies exploring the influence of media on economic assessments have mainly focused on a macro-level analysis.

"It is argued that media effects are more likely to occur for assessments of the national economy than for evaluations of personal economic situations. While citizens are likely to notice economic changes that affect them personally, broader economic changes are less likely to be noticed. Media and social interactions become important for citizens to learn about these national economic changes. Mutz (1992) found that media coverage is a significant factor in identifying unemployment as a social problem, while personal experience with unemployment contributes to the perception of it as a personal problem.","The authors suggest that media effects are mainly observed in assessments of the national economy rather than evaluations of personal economic situations. Although citizens might observe the economic changes in their immediate surroundings, it is difficult for them to notice national economic developments firsthand. Therefore, media and social interactions play a vital role in providing citizens with updates and information about national economic changes. Mutz (1992) found that media coverage influences perceptions of unemployment as a social problem, while personal experience with unemployment contributes to its perception as a personal problem.","According to the authors, media effects are more likely to be observed in evaluations of the national economy than those of personal economic situations. Even though citizens might notice changes in their immediate surroundings that concern their job or businesses, it is difficult for them to observe national economic developments. Consequently, media and social interactions serve as a means for citizens to learn about national economic changes. Mutz (1992) observes that media coverage of unemployment leads to perceptions of unemployment as a social problem, while personal experience with unemployment contributes to a perception of it as a personal problem."
"It has been demonstrated that there is a difference in people's response to positive and negative economic news coverage. Negative information tends to receive more attention and is more frequently used when formulating opinions. Political communication research validates that negative news, including threat or risk frames, creates more powerful impacts on public opinion when compared to positive news. These findings are similar to those from classic persuasion studies that indicate a prevalence of threats and negativity. Recent media and economic studies argue that negative economic news is more likely to be picked up by the public, thus we expect the strength of negative economic news to have a greater effect than that of positive news.","Examining the impact of positive versus negative economic news coverage is important, as research has shown differences in how people respond to each type. Individuals tend to pay more attention to negative information and use it more frequently when forming opinions. Studies in the area of political communication reveal that negative news, particularly that which utilizes threat or risk frames, has a more significant effect on public opinion compared to positive news. This aligns with the results of classic persuasion studies that show a prevalence of negativity and threats. Recent research in media and the economy suggests that people are more inclined to consume negative information about the economy. Therefore, it is anticipated that the impact of negative economic news will outweigh that of positive developments.","It is crucial to analyze the potential disparities in how positive versus negative economic news coverage affects individuals. Psychological research consistently shows that negative information garners more attention and is more frequently used when shaping opinions. Political communication research supports these findings, indicating that negative information, especially when presented in a threat or risk framing, has a more profound influence on public opinion dynamics compared to positive news. This is further reinforced by earlier investigations on classic persuasion studies that emphasize the prevalence of negativity and threat. Recent studies in media and the economy show that negative economic news tends to get more attention from people. As a result, it can be expected that negative economic news will carry more weight than positive news."
"While there has been a longstanding assumption that mass media content has the same influence on everyone, this notion is considered naive according to some scholars (such as Delli Carpini in 2004). More recent research into political communication has emphasized that the effects of media are not universal, but rather dependent upon the individual. In our study on media effects concerning economic assessments, we explore this perspective further. It is important to understand the extent to which people depend on the media to interpret their environment, as this has a significant impact on their opinions and evaluations. Media system dependency theory (MD) posits that an individual's reliance on news media can determine how much they are affected by media messages. This theory has been supported by empirical research on health communication effects, as seen in findings by Morton and Duck (2001).","It was once assumed that mass media content has the same impact on all individuals. However, recent research into political communication has shown that this proposition might be over-simplified. Scholars, including Delli Carpini in 2004, have highlighted the contingency of media effects, which is something we consider in our study on media effects on economic assessments. We acknowledge that the media can have varying effects on different people, depending on the extent to which they rely on it for interpreting their surroundings. This connection between media dependency and media effects is central to Media system dependency theory (MD), which describes how the impact of news coverage on the public is shaped by the degree to which people depend on it for information. Self-reported dependency on mass-mediated information has been seen to impact the impact of mass communication on personal and impersonal perceptions (as noted by Morton and Duck in 2001), thus giving support to the MD theory.","The idea that mass media affects all individuals equally has been challenged in the field of political communication, as some scholars consider it to be naive (e.g., Delli Carpini in 2004). In our study on media effects on economic assessments, we adopt this perspective and analyze how media dependency can influence individual opinions and evaluations. It is crucial to understand the extent to which people rely on the media to interpret their surroundings, as it helps to explain the influence of media messages on public perceptions. Media system dependency theory (MD) posits that individuals who are more dependent on news media are more likely to be impacted by media coverage. This theory has received support from empirical research on the effects of health communication (Morton and Duck in 2001). Therefore, the impact of media messages on individuals is not universal, but rather contingent upon media dependency."

"We utilized three-wave panel survey data and analyzed news content between the panel waves to investigate the expectations that we formulated earlier.

"As a result of practical constraints, we relied on a more limited group of media outlets for the second period. Nevertheless, the descriptive results suggest a significant similarity among outlets for that period. For instance, two out of the three most negative outlets from the first period remain the most negative in the second period (Metro period 1: 2, NRC Handelsblad period 1: 1.78, Metro period 2: 2, NRC Handelsblad period 2: 1.69). Additionally, in the first period, nine out of eleven outlets had national economic evaluations within the range of -1 to -2, which is true for seven out of eight outlets analyzed for the second period. Similarly, when we repeated the analyses for the first period and only considered those outlets available in the second period, the results were almost identical. This gives us confidence that our more limited selection of outlets for the second period is adequate.","Due to practical limitations, we had to restrict the number of media outlets used for the second period.

Furthermore, in the first period, nine out of eleven outlets had national economic evaluations ranging between -1 and -2, which was consistent with seven out of the eight outlets analyzed in the second period. Additionally, replicating the analyses for the first period while only considering outlets available in the second period resulted in highly comparable findings.

However, there is an underrepresentation of men (47.0% vs. 49.4%), young citizens (30.8% vs. 34.2%), and individuals with intermediate vocational education (31.3% vs. 48.0%) in our sample as compared to the census data from the Dutch electorate."
"We utilize multiple OLS regression analyses to evaluate the hypotheses, presenting four models for sociotropic expectations and four models for egocentric expectations. These models examine the relationship between economic expectations at t2 and t3 and the aforementioned variables, while controlling for economic expectations at t1 or t2. The use of a lagged variable allows us to focus on changes in the dependent variable between waves, and incorporating previous economic assessments as controls ensures that our models are not lacking any predictors of static economic evaluations. This methodology is similar to that of Markus (1979).","To evaluate the hypotheses, we conduct several OLS regression analyses. We provide four models each for sociotropic and egocentric expectations. These models examine the relationship between economic expectations at t2 and t3 and the variables mentioned earlier, while controlling for economic expectations at t1 or t2. The incorporation of a lagged variable centers the attention on the change in the dependent variable between two panel waves, which is similar to Markus (1979). Additionally, the previous economic assessments are included as controls to minimize the probability of our models being underspecified by incorporating predictors of static economic evaluations with the lagged term.","In order to evaluate the hypothesizes, we carry out multiple OLS regression analyses. We present four models for sociotropic and four models for egocentric expectations, where we regress economic expectations at t2 and t3 on the already stated variables, while adjusting for economic expectations at t1 or t2. Using a lagged variable focuses on changes in the dependent variable between two waves as suggested by Markus (1979). Furthermore, including prior economic assessments as controls diminishes the probability of our models being insufficiently specified by accounting for predictors of static economic evaluations with the lagged term."
"The study results reveal an interesting finding that changes in sociotropic expectations are not influenced by personal economic circumstances, while changes in egocentric expectations are somewhat related to household income. Since household income can be used as a representative measure for information on personal financial status, this finding suggests that citizens utilize different sources of information (personal experience compared to mass media) to develop various economic expectations.","The findings of the study are quite fascinating as they show that personal economic circumstances have no impact on changes in sociotropic expectations, but there is a certain degree of correlation between household income and changes in egocentric expectations. Household income can act as an approximate indicator of an individual's personal economic situation. Therefore, these outcomes provide suggestive proof that people rely on diverse information sources - such as personal experience versus mass media - to shape different types of economic expectations.","An intriguing observation from the study is that while changes in sociotropic expectations were not impacted by personal economic circumstances, changes in egocentric expectations were somewhat connected to household income. Household income served as a proxy measure for individuals' personal economic situation. Thus, the findings suggest that citizens utilize different sources of information (personal experience versus mass media) when forming various economic expectations."
"During our study, we found that there was no significant change in people's egocentric expectations at the aggregate level, even amidst the worst crisis in half a century. A majority of people believed that their own financial situation would not be jeopardized, despite predicting that the national economy could collapse within the next year. This trend was not unique to the Dutch case and has been observed all over Europe. The reasons behind this pattern could be explained by a lack of experience with severe economic crises, a psychological phenomenon of people's disbelief that misfortune could happen to them, or the fact that it takes time for national economic developments to affect individuals. According to economists, it takes time for the crisis to translate into individual pocketbook considerations. Citizens in general do not seem to link macroeconomic figures to their personal situation.","Despite the worst crisis faced in half a century, the egocentric outlook on the aggregate level of people did not witness any significant change during the study. The majority of people still held on to the belief that their personal financial situation would not be affected, even with the knowledge that the national economy could crumble within the year. This trend wasn't exclusive to the Dutch case, but rather apparent throughout Europe. The reasons behind this trend could be due to a lack of experience with severe economic crises, a general psychological phenomenon of people not believing that misfortune could befall them or time taken for national economic developments to translate into individual pocket book considerations, as acknowledged by experts. On the whole, it is clear that citizens do not link macroeconomic figures to their personal economic situation.","While our study was in progress, egocentric expectations remained largely unchanged at the aggregate level. Remarkably, people were not affected by the worst crisis of half a century regarding their outlook on their personal financial situations. Irrespective of their predictions on the national economy's performance, most individuals felt that their finances would not be jeopardized. The pattern was not exclusive to the Dutch population, but rather a phenomenon seen all over Europe, according to the Eurobarometer 71. The reasons behind this trend could be the lack of experience with severe economic crises, a general psychological phenomenon of people at large denying the possibility of failures happening to them, or the crisis requiring more time to affect masses. Economists suggest that it takes a while for national economic considerations to translate individual pocketbook considerations. All in all, citizens do not credit macroeconomic figures with their personal situation."
"Prior research suggests a negativity bias in media effects on economic perceptions, but our findings contradict this notion. Our study period had prominently negative news coverage, and thus weighting negative news did not impact the independent variable significantly. Moreover, previous studies only observed negativity bias in macro-level time-series studies, and the differences in micro-level dynamics during times of crisis may play a role. Lastly, our research cannot compare the outcomes in times of prosperity with highly positive economic news. Therefore, it is vital to conduct more studies to understand how media effects differ in economic growth compared to crisis.","The results of our study contradict previous research that established a negativity bias in media effects on economic perceptions. The reason for this discrepancy could be that the news coverage during our research period was almost exclusively negative, leading to little variation in the independent variable with an increase in negative news. Also, past research established negativity bias only through macro-level time-series studies, leading to differences in micro-level dynamics during times of economic crises. Additionally, our research cannot compare the outcomes in positive economic news conditions, and future studies should aim to investigate the differences in media effects between times of crisis and prosperity.","While prior studies have uncovered a negativity bias in media effects on economic perceptions, our research data fails to support such a bias. We speculate that the one-sided negative news coverage during our research period might have limited the impact of an increase in negative news on the independent variable. Additionally, the previously established negativity bias has only been reported in macro-level time-series studies, and the current research on an individual level during times of economic crisis with a highly negative news environment could be very different. Finally, we cannot compare our findings with those of a booming economy that features overall positive economic news coverage, and future studies should examine how media effects differ during times of prosperity compared to a recession."
"The current study builds upon previous research by taking into consideration the contextual nature of news effects. Our findings support the notion that media dependency acts as a vital moderator of media influence. We discovered that people who heavily rely on the news tend to react more strongly to positive versus negative economic information, which affirms our third hypothesis (H3). These findings align with Ball-Rokeach et al's (1984) research, which demonstrated that media effects were more pronounced among individuals with higher levels of dependency. Future research could focus on exploring other factors outside of our current model to better understand the motivations and dependency levels of individuals for information from the media. Additionally, our results indicate that media dependency was more important in shaping expectations in the second period, while outlet-specific exposure was more relevant in the first period.","This study builds upon prior research by incorporating an understanding of the contingent nature of news effects. Our results lend credence to the argument that media dependency serves as a critical moderator of media influence. Our findings indicate that individuals who have a greater reliance on the news tend to have a stronger response to positive versus negative economic information, thereby supporting our third hypothesis (H3). This outcome is in keeping with previous research by Ball-Rokeach et al (1984), which found that individuals with higher levels of dependency had a more significant impact on the attitudes and behaviors affected by the media. Future research should look beyond our current model to explore factors external to it to chart the antecedents of motivations and media dependency for information. Furthermore, our findings show that media dependency directly impacted expectations in the second period, while outlet-specific exposure was less crucial for those with a greater reliance on the media.","This research advances previous studies by considering the conditionality of news effects. Our findings support the argument that media dependency is a crucial moderator of media influence. In particular, our results demonstrate that the impact of exposure to positive versus negative economic information on economic expectations in the news becomes more pronounced for individuals with greater media dependency (which supports H3). These outcomes align with the research of Ball-Rokeach et al (1984), who discovered that individuals with higher levels of dependency had the strongest media effects on attitudes and behaviors. To better understand the antecedents of motivations and media dependency for information, future research should focus on external factors beyond our current model. Based on our results, we found that media dependency had a direct effect on changing expectations in the second period, whereas outlet-specific exposure was less important for individuals who heavily rely on the media."
"Despite the limitations, our research findings have contributed significantly towards a better understanding of economic evaluations and their relation with news coverage. It is essential to acknowledge that media coverage of the economy can impact political outcomes. When a positive economic outlook results in higher chances of a political party getting votes, then the opposite is also true. Thus, negative media representation of economic prospects can be dangerous for people in power. Furthermore, this negativity could have a trickle-down effect on the economy, where negative perceptions of future conditions can lead to reduced consumption and thus, impact the broader economic situation. Even if our study's focus was on a unique economic crisis, these dynamics are relevant beyond it.","Despite its limitations, our study has advanced our understanding of economic evaluations and their relationship with media coverage. We recognize that media portrayal of the economy can have ramifications for politics. For instance, if a media outlet depicts a positive economic outlook, this can increase the chances of a political party winning votes, and the same can occur in reverse. Therefore, a negative portrayal of economic prospects in the media can be detrimental to those in power. In addition, there is a possibility that this negativity might cause a spiral effect on economic conditions, leading to reduced consumption amongst people who have a bleak view of the future. While our research focused on a specific economic context, these insights have implications beyond the crisis we studied.","Despite the limitations of the study, our research findings have contributed to our understanding of how economic evaluations relate to media coverage. We acknowledge that media representation of the economy can influence political outcomes. When a positive economic outlook is portrayed, it can lead to a higher likelihood of voting for a particular party, and the inverse is true as well. Therefore, negative media portrayal of economic prospects can be precarious for those in power. Additionally, a downward spiral effect on economic conditions is conceivable if people who are more pessimistic about the future's economic situation are less likely to consume, thereby impacting economic conditions. While our study was conducted during a specific economic crisis, these findings have relevance beyond it."

"A knowledge economy is an economy that relies on knowledge to produce goods and services, and economic models play a crucial role in understanding how such an economy should work. In particular, an effective financial system is necessary for the knowledge economy to operate smoothly. The complexity of societies cannot be understood by any single social science discipline, making cross-disciplinary approaches to understanding societal models necessary. The failure of mainstream economic theory during the first decade of the 21st century signaled a need for a new, valid theory in the face of scholastic conflict between the different schools of economics. Moving forward, incorporating modeling techniques from both exogenous and endogenous economic schools can help improve our understanding of different parts of the economic system.","The concept of a knowledge economy involves using knowledge to produce goods and services, which is why economic models are important in understanding its operation. In a knowledge economy, a stable financial system is particularly crucial since any failures in finance can derail progress. Given society's complexity, it is necessary to use cross-disciplinary approaches to analyze models of knowledge economies. During the early 2000s, mainstream economic theory failed, and this should have prompted a reconsideration of economic theory. However, the various schools of economics did not work together but instead continued to argue. To improve economic theory, exogenous and endogenous modeling techniques from conflicting economic schools can be used to model different aspects of the economic system.","A knowledge economy is one that produces goods and services using knowledge as the primary resource, making economic models essential for understanding its function. The financial system plays a crucial role in a knowledge economy, and any failure in this aspect can halt progress altogether. Due to the complexity of society, cross-disciplinary approaches are necessary to create models of knowledge economies. During the first decade of the 21st century, mainstream economic theory failed as a basis for financial regulation, but rather than collaborate, the different schools of economics continued to squabble. To reexamine economic theory in a comprehensive way, exogenous and endogenous modeling techniques from conflicting economic schools can be used to model different parts of the economy."
"There was evidence of theory failure in the years following the financial crisis of 2008, and economists were struggling to come to a consensus on how to create valid theories. When scientific theory fails to explain empirical reality, it is generally altered, but this was not the case in the field of economics. Instead of adapting economic theory immediately, economists continued to debate whether the market was empirically perfect or only ideally perfect. Mainstream economic theory was based on the assumption of a perfect market, but it was apparent that the financial market was far from perfect. In 2012, Jean-Claude Trichet, the former president of the European Central Bank, complained that conventional tools were of limited help during the crisis, further highlighting the need for change within the field.","Following the financial crisis of 2008, there was historical evidence of the failure of economic theory and the continuing failure of economists to agree on how to create valid theory. While scientific theory is typically revised if it fails to explain empirical reality, economics did not follow this trend. Instead, economists engaged in contentious debate over whether the market was empirically or ideally perfect. Mainstream economic theory assumed a perfect market based on the supply-demand-price equilibrium model, but the financial market was actually quite far from perfect. For instance, in 2012, Jean-Claude Trichet, the former president of the European Central Bank, expressed frustration that conventional tools were of limited help during the crisis.

"Davies had previously held several prestigious positions in academia and the banking industry. Before becoming the Director of the London School of Economics, he served as the Chairman of Britain’s Financial Services Authority and as the Deputy Director of the Bank of England. As an economist with expertise in banking, Davies had a negative opinion about how contemporary economic theory was applied to practical situations. He noted that previous models had erroneously assumed that financial markets could regulate themselves, and financial institutions and their boards were best suited to manage risks. However, the financial crisis exposed the flaws in this assumption, resulting in a shift towards more invasive regulation. Davies believed that restoring trust between financial authorities and private firms would require a new and revised intellectual model.

"In 2010, Chris Giles reported that top academic economists from around the world acknowledged that their subject had fatal flaws that were exposed by the financial and economic crisis. The economists, including five Nobel prize-winners, gathered at the Institute for New Economic Thinking's inaugural conference, sponsored by billionaire financier George Soros, at King's College, Cambridge. Although the conference was intended to agree on policies and ideas to prevent another crisis, the participants could not agree on the root cause of the crisis, nor could they suggest remedies to prevent another. The disagreement centered on whether asset price bubbles were the heart of the crisis, with some calling for tighter regulation, while others believed that price swings were simply part of capitalism. However, Michael Goldberg of the University of New Hampshire argued that the price swings were not necessarily a bubble and were instead integral to the beneficial mechanism of capitalism.","During 2010, Chris Giles reported on the crisis that had exposed major flaws in economics.

"According to Charles J. Whalen, the financial crisis from the end of 2007 to early 2009 had significant impacts on the global economy and accentuated the inadequacies of conventional economic models. Several influential scholars and policymakers, including Paul Krugman, acknowledged these shortcomings during public speaking engagements and in articles published by The New York Times. The Great Recession was a pivotal moment for people to grapple with these challenges. (Whalen 2012).","In the words of economist Charles J.

"Paul Krugman, a Nobel prize-winning economist analyzed the state of economics back in 2009, where he talked about how the discipline was once successful both theoretically and practically, leading to a ""golden era"" for the profession. Economists believed they solved their internal disputes and the ""central problem of depression-prevention""; however, everything started to come apart in 2008. The current crisis, which few economists saw coming, exposed the profession's blindness to the possibility of catastrophic failures in a market economy.

"The division among macroeconomists on this matter still persists. There are those who assert that free-market economies never go astray, while others believe that economies can occasionally falter, but that the Federal Reserve can correct any major deviations from the path of prosperity. Neither side was prepared to deal with an economy that went off the rails, despite the Fed's best efforts. Following the financial crisis, Krugman notes that the fault lines within the economics profession have widened even further.","The views of macroeconomists remain divided over this issue.

"Krugman argued that the persistence of the fault line was due to the economics profession's preoccupation with aesthetics. In Krugman's view, economists erroneously considered captivating and mathematically sophisticated theories as synonymous with truth. Prior to the Great Depression, most economists believed that capitalism was a perfect or nearly perfect system, which was not sustainable in the face of massive unemployment. As recollections of the Great Depression faded, economists once again embraced this glorified version of the economy, even using ornate equations to support it. Unfortunately, this false belief in the economy's remarkable operation caused economists to overlook the flaws of human rationality, institutional corruption, and financial market defects that led to unpredictable crashes. Economists also paid no attention to the weighty consequences of a lack of regulation by regulators. (Krugman 2009).","According to Krugman, the economics profession's obsession with aesthetics can explain the persistence of the fault line. Krugman believed that economists mistakenly perceived beautiful mathematical models as a representation of the truth. Prior to the Great Depression, most economists held onto the notion that capitalism was an ideal system, but mass unemployment exposed the flaws in this line of thinking. However, as memories of the Depression faded, economists once again worshiped the idealized view of the economy, this time supporting it through fancy equations. Sadly, this skewed and mythical view of the economy led economists to ignore numerous threats, such as the limitations of human rationality, institutional failures, market imperfections, and inadequate regulation by regulators, all of which had the potential to cause sudden and unpredictable crashes of the economy's operating system. (Krugman 2009).","Krugman attributed the persistence of the fault line in the economics profession to their preoccupation with aesthetics. Economists made the mistake of considering mathematically impressive models as representative of the truth, and before the Great Depression, most of them believed that capitalism was a nearly perfect system. However, the massive unemployment that followed the Great Depression showed the flaws in this thinking. As time passed and memories of the Depression faded, economists once again fell in love with the idealized vision of the economy, and this time, they supported it with fancy equations. This romanticized view of the economy caused economists to overlook the potential risks posed by human irrationality, institutional corruption, market imperfections, and inadequate regulation by regulators. As a result, sudden and unpredictable crashes of the economy were a possibility. (Krugman 2009)."
"In an economy, there is a direct correlation between the supply and price of a product (dotted line). As the supply increases, competition among businesses results in a decrease in price. Similarly, if there is an increase in demand for a product (solid line), the price of the product also rises due to the limited availability of the product. The equilibrium price, where supply meets demand, is the optimal price for a product in a market, and no price control is necessary in such a scenario since the market sets the optimal balance between supply and demand.","When the supply of a commodity is plotted against its price in an economy, an inverse relationship is observed (dotted line). This is because increased competition due to a surge in supply forces prices down. Conversely, if there is a spike in demand for a product (solid line), the price also rises due to the fixed supply of the product. The equilibrium price, where supply equals demand, represents the optimal pricing for a product in a market, whereby the market sets the optimal price without the need for pricing controls.","In an economy, the relationship between the supply of a commodity and its price is inverse (dotted line). As more goods enter the market, competition among businesses drives prices down. On the other hand, if demand for a product (solid line) increases, the price is driven up, as the product's quantity is limited. An optimal price for a product (commodity) exists when supply equals demand, which results in an equilibrium price, and this is the perfect scenario, where no pricing control is necessary as the market determines the optimal price."
"The Neo-Keynesians believed that the scope of an economy was limitedly seen as a production system by the Neo-Classical Synthesis School economists. Ben Bernanke argued that economists did not fully recognize the importance of a fit financial system for economic growth, nor did they see the role of financial circumstances in short-term economic dynamics. During the first few decades after World War II, economists prioritized developing broad models of the economy with complete markets, ignoring market ""frictions"" such as transaction costs or imperfect information. Nonetheless, in the absence of such frictions, financial markets have no reason to exist.","According to Neo-Keynesians, the Neo-Classical Synthesis School economists had a narrow view of the economy, regarding it solely as a production system. Ben Bernanke pointed out that economists had failed to grasp the significance of a sound financial system for economic growth or comprehend the influence of financial conditions on short-term economic dynamics. Early post-World War II economic theorists concentrated on creating broad equilibrium models of the economy with complete markets, neglecting market ""frictions"" such as transaction costs or imperfect information. However, financial markets have little impetus to exist in the absence of such frictions.","The Neo-Keynesians argued that the Neo-Classical Synthesis School economists had a limited perception of an economy, restricting it to a production system only. Ben Bernanke highlighted that economists had not fully appreciated the importance of a healthy financial system for economic growth or the role of financial conditions in short-term economic dynamics. In the early decades after World War II, economic theorists gave more weight to developing extensive general equilibrium models of the economy with complete markets, overlooking market ""frictions"" like transaction costs or imperfect information. Nevertheless, in the absence of such frictions, financial markets have little justification for their existence."
"Incorporating a time dimension in an economic model is crucial according to Minsky. Keynes had already introduced the concept of time in economics in 1936, which included finance as a part of the economic model. Keynes aimed to develop an economic model where money's neutrality to pricing is challenged by creating a model where the financial asset's price level is determined by financial markets. Money's price as an asset is derived from its liquidity, and each capital and financial asset generates an income stream that has some degree of liquidity and carrying costs. The price level of assets is governed by the relative value of income and liquidity, according to Keynes. (Minsky 1993)","Minsky believed that including a time dimension in an economic model was a critical element. Back in 1936, Keynes had already introduced the time aspect to the economic model, which comprised finance as an essential component. Keynes's goal was to design an economic model where money never had a neutral value when it came to pricing. To achieve this, he created a model where financial assets' price level is determined in financial markets, and money's worth as an asset is derived from its liquidity. Additionally, each capital and financial asset generates an income stream that has carrying costs and varying liquidity degrees. The assets' price level is determined by the relative worth of liquidity and income, as per Keynes. (Minsky 1993)","Minsky argued that incorporating a time dimension into an economic model is vital. As far back as 1936, Keynes had introduced the time element to the economic model, which included finance as a fundamental constituent of the model. Keynes' objective was to create an economic model that challenged the neutrality of money with regards to pricing. Keynes accomplished this by creating a model where the price level of financial assets is determined in financial markets, and the value of money as an asset is derived from its liquidity. Additionally, each capital and financial asset generates an income stream that has carrying costs and different liquidity levels. The assets' price level is influenced by the relative value of liquidity and income, according to Keynes. (Minsky 1993)"
"In the Keynes model of a financial system, time plays a crucial role in determining the value of a capital asset, which is a type of investment that generates income and can be sold in the future. Present-income and future liquidity are the two critical concepts that facilitate this time dependence. Present-income refers to the income stream generated by the asset in the present, while future liquidity refers to its potential value when sold later. The time dimension is represented by T1 (present-income) to T2 (future liquidity), and it is facilitated by borrowing and lending - the fundamental transaction in capitalist economies. Borrowers exchange money-in-the-present for money-in-the-future, which includes both the principal and interest repayments.","The concept of time plays an important role in the Keynes model of a financial system, particularly when it comes to the valuation of a capital asset. A capital asset is an investment that generates income and can be sold in the future. Present-income and future liquidity are two key concepts that describe this time dependence. Present-income refers to the income that the asset generates in the present, while future liquidity refers to its potential value when it is sold later. The time dimension is represented by T1 (present-income) and T2 (future liquidity) and is facilitated through the credit and debt transaction in a financial system. Capitalist economies rely on borrowing and lending, which involve exchanging money in the present for money that will be paid back in the future, with interest and principal included in the contract.","In a Keynesian model of a financial system, the factor of time is critical in the valuation of a capital asset. A capital asset is a type of investment that creates income and can be sold in the future. Two critical concepts, present-income and future liquidity, define this time dependence. Present-income is the income generated by the asset in the present, while future liquidity is its potential value when sold later. The time dimension is represented by T1 (present-income) and T2 (future liquidity) and facilitated by borrowing and lending in a financial system. The essential function of borrowing and lending in a capitalist system involves exchanging money in the present for money that will be returned in the future, with both the interest and the repayment of the contract's principal included."
"The financial system operates in a time dimension that comprises three phases, namely past (credit), present (interest payments), and future (debt repayment). For Keynesians, the temporal nature of credit and debt is crucial in modeling economic systems. A financial market ensures liquidity of capital assets based on their value. Keynes argued that the price level of assets depends on their income stream, carrying costs, and liquidity. In financial markets, the price of money serves as an asset whose worth comes from its liquidity. Future liquidity of credit-debt contracts is possible since financial markets provide such flexibility. Capital assets need current income and future liquidity to remain viable.","The time dimension is a fundamental aspect of a financial system, comprising three stages: credit as the past, interest payment as the present, and debt repayment as the future. Keynesians argue that economic models must include a temporal dimension because credit and debt are essentially time-sensitive financial processes. In the financial market, capital assets are valued based on their liquidity. In his General Theory, Keynes proposed a model where the price level of financial assets is determined in financial markets, and the price of money is an asset whose value comes from its liquidity. Financial markets enable credit-debt contracts to be sold in the future by providing future liquidity. Capital assets require both current income and future liquidity to remain viable, and the relative value of income in the future and liquidity now determines the price level of assets.","The temporal dimension is a crucial aspect of any financial system, encompassing credit as the past, interest payment as the present, and debt repayment as the future.

"The production subsystem was the primary focus of the Neo-Classical Synthesis School, with the present price of a commodity being the main element for controlling it. On the other hand, the Neo-Keynesian School was more concerned with the financial subsystem, where the future price of a capital asset acted as the crucial factor for control. Integrating both the economic models in a complementary framework posed a challenge, and a meta-framework such as societal dynamics theory can provide a methodological solution. This societal systems model employs a topological systems approach of a society, where an economy is an economic subsystem consisting of production and financial sub-subsystems. Detailed information regarding the development of this societal systems model can be found in Betz (2011).","The Neo-Classical Synthesis School placed its emphasis on the production subsystem and the impact of the present price of a commodity on it. Conversely, the Neo-Keynesian School put its focus on the financial subsystem and how the future price of a capital asset controlled it. Combining these two economic models in a complementary framework presents a challenge, which can be overcome by using a meta-framework, such as societal dynamics theory. This meta-framework uses a topological systems model of a society, in which an economy functions as an economic subsystem that accommodates both production and financial sub-subsystems. To learn more about developing this societal systems model, refer to Betz (2011).","The Neo-Classical Synthesis School focused on the production subsystem, with the current commodity price holding the key to controlling it.

"The societal dynamics topological model explains that there are four subsystems in an industrialized society, namely economic, cultural, political, and technological, and these can be represented by stacked planes as shown in Fig. 4. Traditionally, an economy is composed of three subsystems: production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The production subsystem transforms the energy and material resources into goods and services that are financed using a financial system. These goods and services are sold in the market, making it the third subsystem. Therefore, an economic system can be partitioned into four subsystems: production, market, finance, and resources. The exogenous school's model represents an economy as a production system, which is a subsystem of the economic system presented in the larger societal context. On the other hand, the endogenous school's model represents an economy as a financial system, which is viewed as the financial subsystem of the economic plane presented in the broader societal context.","The stasis of a society can be analyzed using the societal dynamics topological model. This model divides an industrialized society into four subsystems, namely economic, cultural, political, and technological. The four subsystems are represented by stacked planes, as shown in Fig. 4. In the field of economics, three subsystems comprise an economy, which are production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The production subsystem, supported by a financial system, produces goods and services from material and energy resources. These goods and services are then consumed within a market, representing the third subsystem of an economic system. Consequently, any economic system can be decomposed into four subsystems: production, market, finance, and resources. This framework allowed the exogenous school to develop an economy model as a production system and to place it within the context of the larger societal framework, specifically as the production subsystem of the economic system. Similarly, the endogenous school's model considers an economy as a financial system, which can be viewed as the financial subsystem of the economic plane in the broader societal context.","The stasis of a society can be modeled using the societal dynamics topological model, which divides an industrialized society into four subsystems: economic, cultural, political, and technological.

The next step is to combine partial economic models from both endogenous and exogenous schools. We will incorporate additional models from diverse social sciences disciplines to create a connected economic system that encompasses all aspects of societal economic subsystem. Our main objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the entire economic system as a whole.,"In order to link the partial economic models of both the endogenous and exogenous schools, we'll explore various models from different social science disciplines to develop a cohesive cross-disciplinary economic system that represents the societal economic subsystem.

"To distinguish between micro and macroeconomics, we initially incorporate partial models from different domains into microeconomics. For constructing a model of a productive economic agent, we utilize the standard ""enterprise model"" from management science, which was pioneered by Michael Porter. The productive organization can be represented as a framework that acquires resources and labor from its surroundings and then transforms them into items that are of greater value and can be sold back to the environment as outputs. This is a depiction of an open system model of a firm that takes inputs from the environment and produces value-added products for its customers.","The field of economics distinguishes between micro and macroeconomics. To incorporate cross-disciplinary partial models into the study of microeconomics, we first turn to management science. From this field, we adopt the common ""enterprise model"" created by Michael Porter as a framework for the productive economic agent.

It functions as an open system that takes inputs and has outputs, with products sold back into the larger environment in which the organization operates.","In economics, a distinction is made between micro and macroeconomics.

This model represents an open system that receives inputs and produces outputs, as its products are marketed and sold back to the surrounding area in which the company operates."
The application of the equilibrium pricing model of supply-demand is limited to specific products within a particular sector of an industrial value chain. The first arrow represents a company model that is functionally associated with a specific industrial sector while the second arrow depicts the specificity of the commodity supply-demand curve regarding this industry sector.,"The equilibrium pricing model of supply-demand can only be used for certain products within a specific part of an industrial value chain. The first arrow symbolizes that a company model is inherently connected to an industrial sector, and the second arrow demonstrates that the supply-demand curve for a commodity is solely specific to that particular sector.","The model of equilibrium pricing of supply-demand is applicable only to a specific set of products in a particular segment of an industrial value chain.

The societal model topological plane on which the exogenous school's supply-demand model is placed illustrates the importance of industry-specific data in order for the model to be empirically real. This involves utilizing real supply-demand data as input and receiving valid price information as output.,"In order for the supply-demand model to be empirically valid, it is necessary to have industry-specific data. This is demonstrated by situating the exogenous school's supply-demand model on a societal model topological plane, with real supply-demand data as input and valid price information as output.",The practical application of the exogenous school's supply-demand model on a societal model topological plane reveals that empirical reality is achieved only when industry-specific data is utilized. This mandates the incorporation of real supply-demand data as input and valid price information as output for the model to be functional.
The revenue data from each firm is collected and sorted based on the commodities that are produced to create an aggregate account. It should be noted that the data does not transfer across the models automatically and has to be independently gathered for each one.,"The combination account is created by gathering revenue data from each firm and categorizing it based on the goods that they produce. It is important to note that while each partial model is interconnected, the data for each must be collected independently, and there is no automatic flow of information from one to another.","To create an aggregate account, revenue data is gathered from individual firms and organized according to the types of commodities that are produced. Each partial model is unique and operates independently, so data does not move from one model to another automatically, but has to be collected separately."
"The emphasis of this article is on the analysis of the relative influence of economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights on growth. The authors conduct a study using a system of three equations to identify the pathways through which these institutional factors affect economic growth. These involve the promotion of greater efficiency and increased investment in human and physical capital. The sample size encompasses 79 countries over a span of six periods from 1976 to 2005.

"Economists are particularly interested in identifying the factors that influence economic growth and contribute to differences in per-capita real incomes across different countries. Although a significant amount of literature exists on this topic, empirical research has had only limited success in revealing the underlying causes of economic growth and the resultant inequalities. As a result, growth models have included an increasing number of explanatory variables, and by the end of the twentieth century, institutional factors had been added to the more traditional factors of labor, physical and human capital, and technology that were considered in neoclassical and endogenous growth models. (Olson 1982, 1996).","Understanding the economic growth determinants and analyzing cross-national disparities in real incomes are key priorities for economists. Despite an abundance of literature on this topic, empirical research has been only moderately successful in identifying the underlying drivers of growth and inequality. Thus, growth models have continually incorporated more explanatory variables to account for variation, with institutional factors being included in addition to the traditional inputs of labor, physical and human capital, and technological innovation seen in neoclassical and endogenous growth models. (Olson 1982, 1996).","Economists are principally concerned with the determinants of economic growth within nations and the differences in per capita real incomes between nations. There is a significant amount of literature in this area, but the empirical research has only provided moderate success in identifying the drivers of growth and inequality.

"In recent years, researchers have commonly incorporated institutions into growth models. These researches include Ak?omak and Weel (2009), Barro (1996), Easterly and Levine (2003), Hall and Jones (1999), Mauro (1995), Rigobon and Rodrik (2005), Stroup (2007), and Yang (2008). The majority of these studies have indicated a positive and significant effect of institutional quality on economic growth, although no definite conclusions can be made. Economic freedom and political freedom have been the most extensively researched dimensions of institutional quality (Aixalá and Fabro 2009). Thus, this study focuses on examining the impacts of these two aspects on growth.","Recently, there has been a common practice among researchers to include institutions in their growth models.

"Political freedom often combines civil liberties and political rights, however, they are two different concepts with differing effects on economic growth. Civil liberties foster freedom of association, expression, belief, press, personal autonomy, and the rule of law. On the other hand, political rights empower people to participate in governance through voting freely, holding public office, joining political organizations, electing decision-making representatives, and holding them accountable for public policies.","Although political freedom is often understood as a combination of civil liberties and political rights, it is important to note that they have distinct implications for economic growth. Civil liberties encompass a wide range of freedoms including expression, press, association, organization, personal autonomy, and the rule of law. Meanwhile, political rights empower individuals to take part in the political process through free voting, joining political parties or organizations, competing for public office, electing representatives who contribute to public policy and are accountable to constituents.","Political freedom is often assumed to mean both civil liberties and political rights, although these two concepts have different implications for economic growth. Civil liberties allow people to freely express themselves, believe in what they want, enjoy the freedom of press, associate and organize with others, as well as experience the rule of law and personal autonomy. In contrast, political rights enable people to participate in democratic governance, including the right to vote freely, compete for public office, join political parties and organizations, and elect decision-making representatives who contribute to public policies and are accountable to their constituents."
"""Milton Friedman (2002) suggests the use of three classifications, namely economic, civil, and political freedom when talking about the different concepts of freedom. According to him, political freedom includes the structure of the political system, the right to vote, and democracy as a society where civil servants are elected through citizens' votes. On the other hand, civil freedom refers to human rights such as freedom of speech, assembly, and expression. The people of Hong Kong are a good example of this differentiation. During British rule, they enjoyed high levels of civil freedom but lacked political freedom according to Freedom House's criteria. A country can have high levels of civil and economic freedoms without political freedom, but it is harder to achieve political freedom without economic freedom. China is one case where the promotion of economic freedom might lead to more political freedom.""","""In discussing various aspects of freedom, Milton Friedman (2002) recommends the use of three categories instead of two, specifically economic, civil, and political freedom. Political freedom involves the way the political system is arranged, the right to vote, and the definition of democracy as a framework in which government officials are chosen through citizens' voting. Civil freedom encompasses human rights, including free speech, assembly, and expression. The example of Hong Kong illustrates this distinction. During British rule, its citizens enjoyed high levels of civil freedom while lacking political freedom as measured by Freedom House. While it is feasible to have high civil and economic freedoms without political freedom, achieving political freedom without economic freedom is challenging.

"The authors Ariel Benyishay and Roger Betancourt contend that the provision of civil liberties to protect human rights is an important indicator of the rule of law's prevalence in a society. When human rights are violated, individuals lose property rights, either through drastic measures like imprisonment or death, or by less overt limitations like restricted freedom of choice. To ensure effective market operation, the authors suggest that civil liberties represent an essential factor due to their constructed social nature, which promotes long-term economic development.","In their argument, Ariel Benyishay and Roger Betancourt highlight the importance of civil liberties in protecting human rights, which is a key indicator of the prevalence of the rule of law in a society. They explain that human rights violations, whether they involve loss of life, restriction of freedom, or other forms of deprivation, can lead to the deprivation of property rights. The authors believe that civil liberties are socially constructed and are vital for the optimal functioning of markets, which can support long-term economic growth. As such, they suggest that there is a strong causal relationship between civil liberties and economic development over time.","According to Ariel Benyishay and Roger Betancourt, one of the most critical measures of the prevalence of the rule of law in a society is the protection of human rights through civil liberties.

The authors argue that markets can only function effectively with proper civil liberties in place as they are socially engineered. Civil liberties can provide crucial support for long-term economic development by nurturing social and economic institutions that engender positive economic growth over time."

"Growth theorists, who support the principles of property rights and some of North's contributions, argue that promoting economic freedom enhances productivity by decreasing transaction costs. This motivates the accumulation of human and physical capital stocks, encourages specialization and economies of scale, and fosters business innovation, ultimately resulting in more efficient organizations. Precise property rights are essential for the market to operate efficiently since the lack of them makes it difficult to allocate and distribute resources, resulting in exorbitant negotiation costs. Also, the lack of transparency and barriers to entry for new competitors or international competition adds transaction costs to the economy, limiting market opportunities. The highest accord has been achieved regarding the positive and significant impact of economic freedom on growth, making it the most important institutional characteristic. This view is supported by scholars such as Azman-Saini, Baharumshah and Law (2010), Carlsson and Lunsdtr?m (2002), Dawson (2003), De Vanssay and Spindler (1994), Easton and Walker (1997), the International Monetary Fund (2003), Justesen (2008), and Stroup (2007).","Economic growth depends on the concepts of property rights school as well as some of North’s ideas, which are embraced by growth theoreticians.

"Robert Barro in 1996 argued that there is a non-linear relationship between democracy and growth.

"Based on empirical research from Giavazzi and Tabellini (2005) and Persson and Tabellini (2006), it is argued that liberalizing the economy is a crucial first step before the expansion of political rights can lead to economic growth. Closed economies with emerging democracies often face distributional conflicts, while established democracies that operate in open economies need to prioritize economic efficiency. Economic liberalization also fosters the rule of law, and enhances protection of property rights, which are prerequisites for democracy to generate economic growth (Giavazzi and Tabellini, 2005).","Empirical studies conducted by Giavazzi and Tabellini (2005) and Persson and Tabellini (2006) suggest that liberalizing the economy is an essential initial step in creating an environment for political rights expansion and economic growth. Democracies that are just beginning and operate in closed economies face issues with redistribution, while established democracies in open economies need to prioritize economic efficiency. Additionally, economic liberalization promotes the rule of law and improved protection of property rights, both of which are prerequisites for democracy to create economic growth (Giavazzi and Tabellini, 2005).","The argument put forth by Giavazzi and Tabellini (2005) and Persson and Tabellini (2006) based on empirical studies, claims that liberalizing the economy is necessary before expanding political rights to achieve economic growth. Newly formed democracies in closed economies face the obstacle of redistribution, whereas established democracies in open economies prioritize economic efficiency. Furthermore, economic liberalization encourages better implementation of the rule of law and strengthens the protection of property rights, making them prerequisite factors for democracy to generate economic growth (Giavazzi and Tabellini, 2005)."
"Political freedom and economic freedom are often studied empirically (Farr, Lord, and Wolfenbarger 1998; Helliwell 1994; Wu and Davis 1999). While both measures are important, economic freedom tends to produce more robust results due to a clearer cost-benefit relationship. Research on the relationship between democracy and economic growth has produced mixed results. Some studies indicate that democracy has a positive impact on economic growth (Gwartney, Lawson, and Block 1996; Hanke and Walters 1997; Rigobon and Rodrik 2005; Rodrik 1999a; Scully 1988; Varsakelis 2006). However, other studies find that the relationship is insignificant (Alesina et al. 1996; Ali and Crain 2002; Barro and Sala-iMartin 1995; De Haan and Siermann 1995, 1996; Mulligan, Gil, and Sala-i-Martin 2004) or even slightly negative (Helliwell 1994; Tavares and Wacziarg 2001).","In empirical research, political freedom is often used as an indicator of civil liberties and political rights globally (Farr, Lord, and Wolfenbarger 1998; Helliwell 1994; Wu and Davis 1999). However, the results obtained from this research tend to be less robust and diverse compared to economic freedom due to the conflict between costs and benefits, as indicated by theory. Studies examining the relationship between democracy and economic growth have produced conflicting results. Some studies suggest that democracy has an overall positive impact on economic growth (Gwartney, Lawson, and Block 1996; Hanke and Walters 1997; Rigobon and Rodrik 2005; Rodrik 1999a; Scully 1988; Varsakelis 2006). On the other hand, some studies have found that the relationship is insignificant (Alesina et al. 1996; Ali and Crain 2002; Barro and Sala-iMartin 1995; De Haan and Siermann 1995, 1996; Mulligan, Gil, and Sala-i-Martin 2004), and in some cases, the relationship is slightly negative (Helliwell 1994; Tavares and Wacziarg 2001).","Empirical research often uses civil liberties and political rights globally as indicators of political freedom (Farr, Lord, and Wolfenbarger 1998; Helliwell 1994; Wu and Davis 1999).

Still, others have found that the relationship is weak and insignificant (Alesina et al. 1996; Ali and Crain 2002; Barro and Sala-iMartin 1995; De Haan and Siermann 1995, 1996; Mulligan, Gil, and Sala-i-Martin 2004), and in some cases, it is even slightly negative (Helliwell 1994; Tavares and Wacziarg 2001)."
"The timing of complex causal relationships between institutional factors and economic outcomes tends to be overlooked in empirical research. Although certain effects may occur at the same time, others may have a delayed structure. Economic progress is one example of this, as it may need a certain period of time before significant developments are seen. Trustworthiness is then of great importance in the process of growth, particularly in countries that have historically faced inconsistent policies and those with a strong aversion to liberalization policies.","When it comes to empirical research, the timing of complex causal relationships between institutional factors and economic outcomes is often disregarded. While some effects may occur concurrently, others may have a lagged structure. Economic freedom is a prime example of this, as it may require time to generate tangible progress. Therefore, credibility is a critical factor for growth processes, particularly in countries that have a history of inconsistent policies and opposition to liberalization policies.","The temporal aspect of complex causal relations between institutional factors and economic outcomes is frequently overlooked in empirical research. While some effects may be observed simultaneously, others are delayed. Economic freedom is an instance where tangible outcomes may require a significant amount of time. Therefore, trustworthiness plays a key role in growth processes, particularly in countries facing unstable policies and opposition to liberalization policies."
"It is necessary to acknowledge the difference between the direct and indirect effects of institutional quality on growth, an aspect that is often overlooked and has led to diverging views. The impact of economic freedom on growth is a subject of debate, with some scholars contending that its effect is greater on productivity than on the accumulation of productive factors, while others argue that it enhances growth by improving both total factor productivity and the accumulation of human and physical capital. A few academics emphasize the importance of efficiency in resource allocation as the primary driver of growth, while others give priority to investment as the means to stimulate growth.","The distinction between the direct and indirect impacts of institutional quality on growth should be considered, as it has been largely ignored and caused a lack of agreement among scholars. Regarding economic freedom's influence on growth, there are varying opinions; some argue that it benefits productivity more than the accumulation of productive factors, while others believe it enhances growth by improving both total factor productivity and the accumulation of human and physical capital. Some scholars stress the significance of increased resource allocation efficiency as the primary driver of growth, while others prioritize investment as the means to stimulate growth.","The direct and indirect effects of institutional quality on growth should be distinguished, an aspect that is typically overlooked and has resulted in a lack of consensus among scholars. Economic freedom's impact on growth is contested, with some asserting that it benefits productivity more than the accumulation of productive factors, while others argue that it promotes growth by improving both total factor productivity and the accumulation of human and physical capital. Some experts claim that growth is primarily increased through more efficient allocation of resources, while others prioritize investment as the means to drive growth."
"In the domain of political freedom, the viewpoint that democracy promotes economic growth while also facilitating the accumulation of human capital is supported by several authors (Mariscal and Sokoloff 2000). However, the evidence for physical capital is not as clear-cut. Authors like José Tavares and Romain Wacziarg (2001), Philipp Harms and Heinrich Ursprung (2002), and Matthias Busse (2004) have found that democratic nations tend to attract more foreign direct investment. At the same time, Adam and Filippaios (2007) argue that democracy could have a detrimental effect on private investment. According to José Aixalá and Gema Fabro (2009), economic liberty is the only critical factor in physical capital investment, but for human capital investment, both economic and political freedoms play a crucial role.","The idea that democracy could stimulate economic growth and enhance the accumulation of human capital is supported by some scholars in the realm of political freedom (Mariscal and Sokoloff 2000). However, the evidence for physical capital is less definite. Democratic countries tend to attract more foreign direct investment, as demonstrated by authors such as Philipp Harms and Heinrich Ursprung (2002), Matthias Busse (2004), and José Tavares and Romain Wacziarg (2001). Meanwhile, Adam and Filippaios (2007) contend that private investment could be negatively influenced by democracy. According to José Aixalá and Gema Fabro (2009), economic freedom is the sole crucial factor in physical capital investment, while both economic and political freedoms are pertinent to human capital investment.","Certain authors contend that democracy may foster the accumulation of human capital while promoting growth in the field of political freedom (Mariscal and Sokoloff 2000). However, the evidence for physical capital is less conclusive. Studies conducted by Philipp Harms and Heinrich Ursprung (2002), Matthias Busse (2004), and José Tavares and Romain Wacziarg (2001) observe that democratic nations tend to be more attractive to foreign direct investment. Nevertheless, Adam and Filippaios (2007) argue that democracy could hinder private investment. José Aixalá and Gema Fabro (2009) suggest that economic freedom is the only key element in physical capital investment. Whereas, economic and political freedoms are fundamental in human capital investment."
"To enhance our comprehension of the procedures involved in economic growth, it is crucial to clarify these routes. Additionally, when utilizing the accumulation of human and physical capital as explanatory variables in the regressions, it should be considered that the institutional variable coefficient is not indicative of the overall effect on economic growth, and thus, it may lead to erroneous conclusions. Therefore, employing simultaneous equation models is recommended to overcome this challenge, although they are underutilized in research (with only a few exceptions noted in the studies of Alesina et al. 1996; Faruk, Kamel and Véganzonès-Varoudakis 2006; Leite and Weidman 2002; Rigobon and Rodrik 2005).","Gaining a better understanding of the processes behind economic growth can be achieved by clarifying these channels. However, when using the accumulation of human and physical capital as explanatory variables in regression analysis, it is important to bear in mind that the coefficient of the institutional variable may not fully reflect the impact on economic growth, leading to inaccurate conclusions. To avoid this, simultaneous equation models could be utilized, although they have been seldom used, with few exceptions noted in the studies of Alesina et al. 1996; Faruk, Kamel and Véganzonès-Varoudakis 2006; Leite and Weidman 2002; Rigobon and Rodrik 2005.","For a better comprehension of the mechanisms that drive economic growth, it is desirable to clarify these channels.

To overcome this issue, simultaneous equation models can be utilized, though they have been under-used in research, with the exception of a few studies such as Alesina et al. 1996, Faruk, Kamel and Véganzonès-Varoudakis 2006, Leite and Weidman 2002 and Rigobon and Rodrik 2005."
"Institutional change can prove to be a complex and time-consuming process due to the historic and cultural foundations of a country's institutions, often leading to opposition by those who prefer the status quo. However, it is crucial to consider the temporal aspect, as institutional changes can progress rapidly in developing countries. For example, according to the IMF, since the mid-1980s, there has been worldwide progress in establishing the rule of law, with notable advancements in the early 1990s. Furthermore, Central and Eastern European countries that underwent economic and political reforms have experienced substantial institutional developments. Additionally, the IMF has cited changes in states like Afghanistan and Kosovo as examples of significant institutional changes in post-conflict regions.","Institutional changes can be challenging to execute due to the deep-seated roots of a country's cultural and historical institutions. Additionally, those who wish to maintain the status quo will often resist comprehensive reforms. However, it is essential to consider the time frame of institutional changes, with developing countries experiencing rapid progress. For instance, the IMF indicates that globally, there has been substantial progress in implementing the rule of law since the mid-1980s, specifically in the early 1990s. The IMF notes the substantial institutional strengthening in Central and Eastern European nations, which implemented political and economic reforms. Furthermore, the IMF references the radical changes in post-conflict states such as Kosovo and Afghanistan, illustrating the transformative power of institutional changes.","Institutional change is a complex and slow-moving process since a country's institutions are often deeply ingrained in its history and culture. Furthermore, those opposed to comprehensive reforms may resist change. However, it is important to understand temporal factors as institutional changes may happen quickly, particularly in developing countries. The IMF revealed noteworthy progress in establishing the rule of law globally since the mid-1980s, especially during the early 1990s. The IMF also highlighted the institutional strengthening resulting from the political and economic reform in Central and Eastern Europe. Additionally, the IMF identified significant changes in post-conflict states such as Afghanistan and Kosovo, indicating that institutional changes could bring about significant progress in troubled regions."
"This paper utilizes institutional data sources like Freedom House's annual civil liberties and political rights indices. These indices are based on strict evaluations from human rights specialists, academics, journalists, political figures, and regional experts. Moreover, the paper refers to the Fraser Institute's index of world economic freedom, which has been published since the 1970s. This index mainly consists of quantifiable and objective information, however, certain components are still subject to subjective evaluations by researchers and experts (see Appendix 1, p. 1077).","The indices of civil liberties and political rights published annually by Freedom House since the early 1970s are used as institutional data in this paper.

"The selection of economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights indices is justified based on the prestige of the organizations that release them. Moreover, they are reliable indicators for measuring the concepts they aim to represent. The comprehensive coverage of time and countries of these indices is particularly suitable for utilizing panel data methods and investigating time lags to assess the effect of these freedoms on economic growth. For the other variables, including growth of per capita GDP (PPP), investment in physical capital, rates of enrollment in primary and secondary education (as an investment in human capital), trade, and initial income, the World Development Indicators database of the World Bank supplements the analysis.","We opted for economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights indices over other indices because of the credibility of the organizations that produce them. Additionally, they are sound measures for the concepts they intend to capture. The wide range of countries and time frames covered by these indices make them ideally suited for panel data analysis and adjusting for delays in the variables to assess the impact of these freedoms on growth. When it comes to other variables such as growth of per capita GDP (PPP), investment in physical capital, rates of enrollment in primary and secondary education (as investment in human capital), trade and initial income, we referred to the World Development Indicators database of the World Bank.","We selected economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights indices for measuring the freedom landscape due to the notability of the organizations that release these indices.

"Institutional dimensions, when analyzed separately, display predicted signs and significant results. According to neoclassical theory, the growth equation has negative initial income sign which turned out to be significant in eight out of nine estimations, thereby validating the hypothesis of convergence. Positive and statistically significant coefficients were found for the investment in physical and human capital variables, but only the physical one showed expected signs in all nine equations. The rate of enrollment in primary education and openness in the first equation, as well as the lagged rate of enrollment in primary education and initial income in the second, were all positively signed and had high levels of significance in all estimations of both the physical and human capital investment equations.","When the institutional dimensions are analyzed individually, all the traditional variables demonstrate the expected signs and are typically significant. As projected by neoclassical theory, the growth equation displays a negative initial income sign that is significantly observed in eight of the nine calculations, thereby confirming the hypothesis of convergence. The variables pertaining to investment in physical and human capital display positive and statistically significant coefficients, except for human capital, which is not significant in three of the nine equations despite representing the expected sign in all cases. Furthermore, in both equations for investment in physical and human capital, explanatory variables such as the rate of enrollment in primary education and openness for the first equation, and the lagged rate of enrollment in primary education and initial income for the second equation, exhibit the expected positive sign and a high degree of significance across all estimations.","Considering institutional dimensions separately, all the traditional variables present anticipated signs and display significant outcomes. As per the predictions of neoclassical theory, the growth equation manifests a negative initial income sign that appears significant in eight out of the nine estimations, thereby verifying the convergence hypothesis. The coefficients of physical and human capital investment variables demonstrate positivity and statistical significance, except for human capital, which, despite having anticipated signs in all cases, is not significant in three out of nine equations. In the equations that detail investment in physical and human capital, explanatory variables such as the rate of enrollment in primary education and openness in the first equation, and the lagged rate of enrollment in primary education and initial income in the second equation, depict the anticipated positive sign and retain a high level of significance in all estimations."
"The results pertaining to the institutional variables studied highlight the significant impact of economic freedom (as observed in Table 1) on growth by enhancing resource allocation and encouraging investment in physical and human capital. Additionally, economic freedom is highly significant in all three equations of the system (systems 1 and 2). Moreover, introducing two lags in the analysis (system 3) leads to maintaining the significance of economic freedom in the equation of physical capital investment, and consequently improving the efficacy of the model.","The study's examination of institutional variables reveals compelling results, with economic freedom (as shown in Table 1) contributing significantly to growth through its enhancement of resource allocation and increased investment in physical and human capital. Notably, economic freedom possesses high significance in all three equations of the system (systems 1 and 2). When the analysis involves two lags (system 3), economic freedom continues to retain its significance in the physical capital investment equation, leading to an enhancement of the model's explanatory power.","Based on the institutional variables that were studied, economic freedom (Table 1) emerges as a crucial factor in promoting growth. This is because it leads to improved resource allocation and encourages investment in physical and human capital, resulting in significant impacts on all three equations of the system (systems 1 and 2). When the analysis includes two lags (system 3), economic freedom retains its significance in the physical capital investment equation, ultimately improving the model's overall explanatory power."
"The results obtained empirically validate the concepts of the property rights school and the contributions made by North (1990) and Olson (1982), which were later included in growth theory, regarding the crucial role of economic freedom in promoting the accumulation of physical and human capital, reducing transaction costs, and increasing productivity. The presence of civil liberties (Table 2) and political rights (Table 3) makes a significant difference in driving growth as they help in improving resource allocation and investment in physical and human capital (systems 1, 2, and 3). Even when we consider two lags of the variables, civil liberties and political rights retain their significance across the three equations, leading to improved explanatory power in the models.","The results derived from empirical evidence provide support for the notions presented by the property rights school and the contributions made by North (1990) and Olson (1982), which were subsequently integrated into growth theory, concerning the critical role played by economic freedom in facilitating the accumulation of physical and human capital, lowering transaction costs, and enhancing productivity. The existence of civil liberties (Table 2) and political rights (Table 3) is found to be critical in promoting growth since it drives resource allocation and investment in physical and human capital (systems 1, 2, and 3). Analyzing the variables with two lags indicates that the importance of civil liberties and political rights prevails across all three equations, leading to a marked improvement in the model's explanatory power.","The empirical findings validate the ideas originating from the property rights school and observations made by North (1990) and Olson (1982), which were later incorporated into growth theory, regarding the vital role played by economic freedom in encouraging the accumulation of human and physical capital, mitigating transaction costs, and enhancing productivity. The presence of civil liberties (Table 2) and political rights (Table 3) is pivotal in driving growth by aiding resource allocation and promoting investment in physical and human capital (systems 1, 2, and 3). When considering two lags of the variables, the significance of civil liberties and political rights remains in all three equations, thereby increasing the model's explanatory capability."
"According to additional research papers (Gwartney, Lawson and Holcombe 1999; Hanke and Walters 1997; Stroup 2007), it's substantiated that economic freedom holds more prominence in stimulating growth in comparison to civil liberties and political rights. An examination of Table 4 indicates that the current values display superior coefficients for this institutional dimension. Nonetheless, it's important to note that civil liberties have a coefficient almost the same as economic freedom in the case of human capital, and when variables lags are integrated, economic freedom's predominance becomes less significant.","Additional studies (Gwartney, Lawson and Holcombe 1999; Hanke and Walters 1997; Stroup 2007) provide further support for the notion that economic freedom has a greater effect on growth compared to civil liberties and political rights. When considering current values, Table 4 reveals more superior coefficients for this institutional dimension. However, it should be noted that civil liberties have a coefficient that is nearly as large in the case of human capital, and including lags in variables causes economic freedom to lose its supremacy.","Other academic research (Gwartney, Lawson and Holcombe 1999; Hanke and Walters 1997; Stroup 2007) lends support to the idea that economic freedom has a greater impact on growth than civil liberties and political rights. The results presented in Table 4 show superior coefficients for this institutional dimension when current values are used. However, it is important to note that for human capital, civil liberties have a coefficient that is almost as sizable as that for economic freedom. Moreover, when accounting for variable lags, economic freedom's superiority over other factors becomes less pronounced."
"The purpose of this analysis was to investigate the importance of institutional components, such as economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights, on economic growth. The study also aimed to differentiate between the direct and indirect influence of these dimensions. The outcomes revealed that institutional quality is vital for the economic progression of nations, as it promotes better allocation of resources and investment in capital. Moreover, the results demonstrated that economic freedom is the most significant factor for economic growth, followed by civil liberties concerning investment in human capital, however, when considering lags, civil liberties and political rights retained their high level of importance, whereas economic freedom was no longer the most significant element.","The aim of this study was to uncover the significance of institutional dimensions like economic freedom, civil liberties, and political rights on economic growth, and to distinguish between their direct and indirect effects.

"The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of economic liberalization on economic growth in Pakistan from 1971 to 2011 in both short and long terms. Liberalization of the economy covers changes in both trade and financial sector. Principal component analysis was conducted to create an economic liberalization index for this study that contributes to the extant literature. Our findings indicate that economic liberalization reforms foster economic growth positively in the short term, while trade liberalization adversely affects economic growth in the long run. Further, the study reveals unstable impacts of economic liberalization on real GDP during the sample period under the rolling window approach. Finally, policymakers should focus more on human capital development through higher education expenditures and financial reforms like sectoral credit allocation to facilitate Pakistan's economic growth.","The primary goal of the research is to analyze the influence of economic liberalization on the economic growth of Pakistan from 1971 to 2011 in both the short and long term.

"The connection between economic liberalization (EL) and economic growth (EG) has garnered significant attention from scholars, particularly after the emergence of new growth theories. In the 1980s, many developing countries, inspired by the endogenous growth theory model, initiated liberalization to achieve EG. Complete liberalization requires the liberalization of both the financial and trade sectors. Nevertheless, there is no conclusive empirical evidence on the outcomes of financial and trade liberalization.","The relationship between economic liberalization (EL) and economic growth (EG) has been a prominent area of research since the rise of new growth theories. In the 1980s, many developing countries adopted the endogenous growth theory model to promote EG through liberalization. This entailed the liberalization of both the financial and trade sectors. Despite this, empirical evidence on the effects of liberalizing both the financial and trade sectors remains uncertain.","Following the emergence of new growth theories, the connection between economic liberalization (EL) and economic growth (EG) has become a topic of substantial interest for researchers.

Nonetheless, there is no consensus on the empirical findings on the impacts of financial and trade liberalization."
"Pakistan decided to implement financial sector liberalization in the late 1980s as a means of achieving three objectives: enhancing the efficiency of financial markets, formulating more efficient monetary and credit policies that are based on market mechanisms, and strengthening the financial institutions that are based on markets and capital.","In the late 1980s, Pakistan embarked on a process of financial sector liberalization with a three-pronged agenda. These included improving the effectiveness of financial markets, developing market-oriented, more efficient monetary and credit policies and strengthening the institutional capacity of financial institutions based on capital and markets.","During the late 1980s, Pakistan initiated the process of liberalizing its financial sector with three key objectives in mind. These were to create an environment that could promote the efficiency of financial markets, fashion market-oriented, operationally more robust monetary and credit policies, and enhance the capacity, and efficacy of the financial institutions that were founded upon capital and market based principles."

"The available empirical literature suggests that the majority of studies have employed three indicators as proxies for exploring the influence of trade openness on economic growth. These proxies include export-to-GDP ratio, import-to-GDP ratio, and the sum of export and import-to-GDP ratios. The advantage of utilizing these proxies lies in the fact that the relevant data is easily obtainable. A lower value of these three indicators is thought to indicate a higher degree of government intervention in the trade sector.","According to the empirical literature, the majority of studies have made use of three proxy indicators to assess the impact of trade openness on economic growth.

"To calculate the important weights, the researchers employed the PCA technique. The table shows that the initial component accounts for around 65 % of the overall variance in the data. Additionally, the second component is responsible for 35% while the last principal component has no standardized variation. The first principal component demonstrates the highest variance that can be observed among various blends of variables. The researchers used the weight derived from the first eigenvector value as an amalgamation of trade openness, denoted as TLI, in our study. Moreover, TD; M, and X contribute 71.6%, 54% and 44.2% separately to the standardized variance of the first principal component.","Utilizing the principal component analysis (PCA), the essential weights were derived. As per Table 2, the first principal component accounts for approximately 65% of the total variation in the data. Furthermore, the second component accounts for another 35%, while the last component exhibits zero standardized variation. Out of all variable combinations, the first principal component illustrates the highest variation. The researchers used the weight derived from the first eigenvector value to create a composite measure of trade openness, named TLI. Furthermore, TD, M, and X contribute to 71.6%, 54%, and 44.2%, respectively, to the standardized variance of the first principal component.","The vital weights were determined using the PCA method. According to Table 2, the first principal component explains about 65% of the total variation in the data, followed by the second component accounting for 35% of the variance, while the last principal component shows no variation at all.

The researchers used the first eigenvector's value as a weight in creating a composite measure of trade openness referred to as TLI in this study. Additionally, TD; M, and X variables contributed 71.6%, 54%, and 44.2%, respectively, to the first principal component's standardized variance."
"To estimate cointegration tests, the SBC method is utilized in this study to find the optimum lag order as the JJ Cointegration approach is highly sensitive to the lag order. The trace test results from Table 5 indicate that a cointegration relationship exists in models 1-12. However, the cointegration vector varies across the models; models 1, 3, 4, 9, and 10 have one cointegrating vector while models 2, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 12 have two cointegrating vectors. Only in model 8 are three cointegrating vectors found.","Considering the sensitivity of the JJ Cointegration approach to the lag order employed, the SBC method is utilized in this research to determine the optimal lag order before conducting cointegration tests. The trace test outcomes presented in Table 5 demonstrate that there is a cointegration relationship in models 1-12. However, the cointegration vector differs depending on the model. Model 1, 3, 4, 9, and 10 present one cointegrating vector, while models 2, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 12 present two cointegrating vectors. Only model 8 exhibits three cointegrating vectors.","In order to estimate cointegration tests, the SBC method is used to find the optimal lag order since the JJ Cointegration approach is highly sensitive to lag order.

Model 8 is the only model that displays three cointegrating vectors."
"The rolling window regression method is employed to assess the stability of variable coefficients during the selected data period. The cointegration econometric techniques currently available presume that coefficient estimates are unaffected throughout the sampled data. However, the economy's dynamics continuously change, resulting in fluctuations in economic indicators. As a result, the estimated coefficients of economic indicators cannot remain constant throughout the sample.","Rolling window regression is utilized to examine the consistency of variable coefficients within a specified data timeframe. The cointegration econometric approaches available assume that the coefficient estimates of the model would remain steady throughout the sample. However, in reality, the economy undergoes fluctuations due to changing economic indicators. As a result, the estimated coefficients of such economic indicators cannot remain constant throughout the sample period.","The rolling window regression method is applied to verify the stability of variable coefficients within the selected data period. Most of the available cointegration econometric techniques assume the constancy of model coefficients throughout the data sample. In reality, the economy goes through different phases due to variations in economic indicators, resulting in fluctuations. Hence, the estimated coefficients of such economic indicators cannot remain the same throughout the entire sample."

"Researchers have studied the connection between economic growth and the financial system, which comprises the stock markets and the banking system, for several decades. Influential scholars like Beck and Levine (2004), Capasso (2008), Goldsmith (1969), Keynes (1973), Levine (1991), and Schumpeter (1982) have contributed to this area of research. Capital markets are primarily utilized for corporate financing in Anglo-Saxon countries, while banking systems are more commonly used in non-Anglo-Saxon countries, as highlighted by Marini (2005) and Lee (2012).","Scholars have dedicated substantial effort to investigating the relationship between economic growth and the financial system, which is composed of the banking system and stock markets.

"To determine the relationship between growth and financial system, it is important to take into account long series and control structural changes. Focusing on Portugal, which is a smaller economy, allows us to analyze the impact of structural changes in more detail. The period of the 1990s and 2000s had significant economic and political changes, making it an ideal time to study the interaction of variables. Since Portugal is not an Anglo-Saxon country, the banking system is predicted to have more influence on the economy than the stock market.","Examining the correlation between growth and the financial system requires analyzing long time series while accounting for structural changes. In order to investigate the impact of structural changes in a smaller economy, Portugal is selected as the case study. The late 1990s and early 2000s were a time of extensive economic and political changes, offering a valuable opportunity to study variable interactions. Portugal, as a non-Anglo-Saxon country, is expected to have a more influential banking system vis-à-vis the stock market in terms of the wider economy.","To determine the relationship between economic growth and the financial system, it is essential to consider long-term series data and control for any structural changes. The small economy of Portugal has been chosen as a case study to investigate the impact of structural changes on growth. The years of the 1990s and 2000s are a vital period to consider as it saw Portugal experience significant economic and political changes. The banking system, as opposed to the stock market, is expected to play a larger role in Portugal's economy due to it being a non-Anglo-Saxon country."
"The study indicates that economic growth is affected by the stock market and is demonstrated by Granger causality. On the other hand, there is no validation of the Granger causality from the banking system to the growth of the economy. This research enables us to have a better grasp of how to employ economic strategies for the financial sector, with a focus on either the banking or stock market sectors.","Based on the results, it appears that the stock market has a Granger causal relationship with economic growth.

"The concept of stock market development lacks a clear definition. However, to study this development, four indicators (market capitalization, volatility, institutional development, and regulation indicators) proposed by Demirgu?-Kunt and Levine (1996) can be used. In addition, measuring the banking system is essential, and ratios of domestic credit to GDP or nominal money supply (monetary aggregate M2) to nominal GDP can be utilized for this purpose. Other factors, including inflation, are also sometimes considered in the model.","Despite the fact that the definition of stock market development is not entirely clear, there are four metrics proposed by Demirgu?-Kunt and Levine (1996) that can be utilized to analyze it: market capitalization, volatility, institutional development, and regulation indicators.

"Financial development due to endogenous growth processes is a well-explored concept in existing literature (for example, Bose and Cothren, 1997; Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1990). All variables are connected, and thus, endogenous adjustment brings about effects, requiring the use of the VAR technique. This technique views variables as potentially endogenous and evaluates relationships without requiring the differentiation of endogenous and exogenous variables, unlike the simultaneous equations model. Researchers like Caporale et al. (2004) and Tsouma (2009) have utilized this technique while studying the connection between developed stock markets and economic growth.","The concept of financial development resulting from endogenous growth processes has been well-established in the literature (e.g. Bose and Cothren, 1997; Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1990).

"The study's findings suggest that in order to conduct an accurate analysis of the contribution of the stock market to economic growth, it is important to consider specific variables as exogenous, including the constant, seasonal dummies, one impulse dummy during the second quarter of 2000, and two shift dummies. Controlling for the physical introduction of the euro notes and coins or integration in Euronext is essential, as is controlling for the subprime crisis that occurred from the last quarter of 2008 in Portugal. The results of the VAR model also indicate that the physical introduction of the euro had a greater impact on the economy than the integration in Euronext. The shift dummy is highly statistically significant in the GDP and stock market equations, with a negative signal that suggests a negative effect on the economy.","According to the results, an accurate analysis of the stock market's impact on economic growth requires considering certain variables as exogenous.

"The optimal lag structure for the VAR estimation is determined by conducting tests such as the sequential modified LR test, the final prediction error, and the Akaike information criterion. These tests consistently indicate that three lags are the best option for a parsimonious model with no omission variable bias. Additionally, further evaluation of the estimated VAR model is carried out through diagnostic tests, which include the Jarque Bera test for normality, LM test for autocorrelation, and White test (excluding cross terms) for heteroskedasticity.

"This paper examines the impact of both stock markets and bank financing on economic growth and highlights the significance of comprehending this contribution when designing policies for growth. If the growth response varies across the two systems due to innovative changes, then policymakers need to prioritize taking action towards the more responsive system.","The primary focus of this paper is to evaluate how economic growth is influenced by stock markets and bank financing systems, and it stresses the essentiality of fully grasping this relationship when creating growth-oriented economic policies. If one of the systems displays a more favorable response to an innovative change, then policymakers should prioritize their efforts on that specific system.","The objective of this paper is to assess the contribution of stock markets and bank financing to economic growth, and it emphasizes the importance of fully comprehending this association when developing policies aimed at promoting economic growth. In the event that the response to an innovation varies between the two systems, it is crucial that policymakers prioritize the system that exhibits the most favorable response."
"The competing systems have been found to be different based on Granger causality, variance decomposition, and impulse response function measures. Fig. 3 shows that an innovation in one system leads to a decrease in the relative weight of the other system. Bank financing responds more rapidly and strongly to innovations in the stock market, while the stock market responds less to bank financing. This reveals that bank financing is more self-contained compared to the stock market. This result was unexpected, given that Portugal is a non-Anglo-Saxon country, and companies are expected to rely heavily on bank financing, which should play a significant role in fueling Portuguese economic growth.","According to the Granger causality, variance decomposition, and impulse response function metrics, the competing systems differ from each other. The weight of one system decreases when there is any innovation in the other system, as evidenced in Fig. 3. The impact of an innovation in the stock market on bank financing is more noticeable and quicker than the vice versa. In general, bank financing is more insular than the stock market. This finding was a surprise since Portugal is a non-Anglo-Saxon country and is assumed to have widespread bank financing in corporations, making bank lending play a crucial role in the economic growth of Portugal.","The competing systems have been distinguished from each other based on the Granger causality, variance decomposition, and impulse response function.

This discovery was not foreseen, given that Portugal is a non-Anglo-Saxon country, and bank financing is thought to be widespread in companies and play a key role in Portuguese economic growth."
"The findings obtained from Table 5 corroborate with the outcomes of the exogeneity tests. All variables exhibit a dynamic pattern, which is necessary regarding endogeneity (refer to Table 5 and Fig. 3). DLY events show an impact of about 85% to the forecast error variance after a two-quarter lag, which gradually decreases to around 59% towards the end of the ten-quarter period. In contrast, DLS shocks considerably impact forecast error variance when compared to DLB, explaining approximately 15.5% and 3%, respectively, at the end of the ten-quarter period. The shocks to DLI consistently gain strength, quintupling from 2.5% to 5.8% in explaining the forecast error variance. As expected, nominal effects control is crucial in models that integrate financial determinants.

"The research aims to evaluate the impact of stock market development on the economic growth of Portugal between 1993 and 2011. Portugal is a small economy that faces significant changes in its structure; hence the study will conduct a comparison to determine the effects of two different financing systems, stock market and bank financing, on the country's economic growth. The study detected no correlation between the two financing systems. The researchers utilized a VAR model with exogenous impulse and shift dummies, which is a suitable technique for analyzing the contribution of stock market and bank financing to economic growth. However, the study acknowledges the need to consider specific Portuguese idiosyncrasies to ensure that causal relationships among variables are not distorted, leading to incorrect conclusions.","In this article, the goal is to assess the influence of stock market development on economic growth in Portugal during the period of 1993 to 2011. Because Portugal is a small economy, the study considers the impact on economic growth caused by structural changes that occur. Furthermore, the study explores which financing system between bank financing and stock market financing contributes more to economic growth. The study did not find any correlation that could explain the relationship between the two competing financing systems. To evaluate the contribution of these financing systems to Portugal's economic growth, the study used a VAR model with exogenous impulse and shift dummies.

"The financial system is composed of two components, and their behaviors have been observed. One component, namely the stock market, has a positive causal relationship with economic growth. The relationship is bilateral, indicating that the stock market drives economic growth, and economic growth in turn promotes stock market development. In contrast, the banking system benefits from economic growth but does not contribute to it. Therefore, policymakers should prioritize the promotion of stock market development over bank financing to stimulate economic growth. Furthermore, more research is needed to understand the interaction between financial markets and different aspects of economic growth.","Two distinct behaviors have been identified within the financial system's components. The stock market component exhibits a positive causal relationship with economic growth. This relationship is bidirectional in nature, as the stock market plays a crucial role in driving economic growth, while economic growth promotes the development of the stock market. Conversely, the banking system seems to benefit from economic growth without contributing much to it. Therefore, economic policies should prioritize the promotion of stock market development over bank financing to enhance economic growth. There is scope for further research to explore the channels through which different financial markets interact with economic growth.","In the financial system, there are two components - the stock market and the banking system - that exhibit different behaviors. The stock market has a positive causal relationship with economic growth, and this relationship is bidirectional. This means that the stock market affects economic growth, and economic growth, in turn, promotes the development of the stock market. On the other hand, the banking system seems to be a net beneficiary of economic growth, but it does not contribute significantly to promoting economic growth. Hence, economic policies should focus on promoting the development of the stock market, rather than relying on bank financing, to drive economic growth. Research should also be conducted to understand how different financial markets interact with economic growth."
"Through the control variables, the Portuguese reality was analyzed and proven. The research found that investment did not have a significant impact on the overall economy and there was a noticeable decrease in economic price competitiveness.

"We analyzed economic voting in times of financial crisis using data from individual-level surveys carried out during the Canadian elections in 2008 and 2011. Our hypothesis is that during a crisis, the effect of the economy on incumbent voting can be divided into two parts. The first impact is traditional in nature, and it is based on an assessment of past economic conditions, which are inevitably adverse due to the crisis. The second impact is determined by perceptions of the parties' competence in handling the economy, and the competence effect can make up for any incumbent vote losses that may result from the economic downturn. To be more precise, by looking at issue ownership based on competence, we can incorporate a neglected valence component into the economic voting model.","We examined economic voting during financial crisis periods by utilizing survey data gathered from individual-level respondents who took part in the Canadian Election Studies of 2008 and 2011. Our premise is that the effect of the economy on incumbent voting during such times can be explained through two factors. Firstly, there is the traditional impact that arises due to retrospective evaluations of the national economic state, which is inevitably unfavorable during crises. Secondly, there is a perception-based impact that depends on the parties' competence in managing the economic conditions, and this competence effect can stand in for incumbent vote losses that may result from bad economic times (traditional effect). By considering competence-based issue ownership, we can account for a previously-neglected valence component in the economic voting model.","In order to investigate economic voting during periods of financial crisis, we utilized data from individual-level surveys conducted during the 2008 and 2011 Canadian Election Studies. Our hypothesis is that there are two factors that impact incumbent voting during these times. The first pertains to retrospective assessments of national economic conditions, which are inevitably negative during crises. The second factor involves perceptions of the parties' competence in managing the economy, and the competence effect can potentially offset any incumbent vote losses from bad economic times (traditional effect). By examining issue ownership based on competence, we can introduce a previously-ignored valence component to the economic voting model."
"According to the theory of voting behavior, the economy is a valence issue, where the majority of political parties and voters agree that economic growth is a desirable goal (Stokes, 1963). Essentially, there is a widespread consensus among parties and voters on this subject, because of the importance of economic development for the entire society. Therefore, the main factor that affects voters is whether the government accomplishes this objective or not. A government that can achieve the target stands a higher chance of being re-elected in the following election. On the other hand, if it fails to produce results, it faces the possibility of being voted out of office.","The economy is commonly regarded as a valence issue in voting behavior theory (Stokes, 1963), where a majority of parties and voters agree that economic growth is a desirable objective in democratic societies. Since there is a shared understanding of what needs to be achieved economically for society as a whole, parties and voters are generally united in their stance on this matter. However, what matters most to voters is the actual delivery of this goal by the government. If the government can deliver the desired outcome, it has a more significant chance of being re-elected in the next election. However, if it falls short of the expectations, it faces a real risk of being voted out of office.","As per the voting behavior theory, the economy is perceived as a valence issue (Stokes, 1963), where the majority of political parties and voters favor economic growth as a desirable goal in democratic societies. This implies that there is broad agreement among parties and voters on this matter, and a shared perspective of what economic advancement means for the betterment of society. However, voting decisions are contingent on whether the government is successful in achieving this objective. If the government can effectively deliver on its promises, it has a higher chance of being reelected. In contrast, if the government fails to attain this goal, it risks being voted out of office."
"The notion of 'traditional economic voting' expectancy was coined by Lewis-Beck in 1988, and it serves as the fundamental concept of a valence model of economic voting as described by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau in 2011. According to this model, voters evaluate the government's previous performance and cast their vote based on that review, effectively holding the government responsible for the economic state of their country.","In 1988, Lewis-Beck introduced the idea of 'traditional economic voting' expectation, which later formed the basis of a valence model of economic voting, as explained by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau in 2011. According to this model, voters evaluate the government's past economic performance and then cast their vote, holding the government accountable for the recent economic changes in their country.","Lewis-Beck coined the term 'traditional economic voting' expectation in 1988, which paved the way for a valence model of economic voting, as outlined by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau in 2011. The model proposes that voters scrutinize the government's past economic record and use their judgment to cast their ballot, making the government answerable for the economic state of their nation."
"The valence model of economic voting mainly concerns itself with voters' assessments of economic conditions retrospectively. However, it is not surprising to think that voters also take into account the ability of different political parties to tackle the issues. The competence of the political parties is a vital element in the valence model of political choice. As a result, there is an increasing focus on examining the influence of the perception of party efficiency in managing the economy on an individual's vote choice. A range of studies has started to investigate this aspect of voting, emphasizing the importance of party performance in economic management.","The current formulation of the valence model of economic voting is primarily concerned with voters' retrospective evaluations of the economic situation. Although it is reasonable to expect voters to respond to recent economic changes, it is also plausible that voters consider the competency of political parties in managing economic issues. The reputation of political parties as adept political actors is a vital part of the valence model of political choice. Consequently, an emerging body of research aims to examine the effect of attitudes towards party competence in economic management on voters' decision-making. This line of inquiry stresses the relevance of party performance in economic management as a critical factor in determining voter behavior.","The current formulation of the valence model of economic voting primarily takes into account voters' assessments of previous economic conditions. While it is reasonable to anticipate voters would react to recent shifts in economic conditions, it is also conceivable that they consider the competence of political parties in managing economic issues. In the valence model of political choice, the reputation of political parties as competent political actors is a fundamental component. As a result, a growing number of studies have begun to analyze the impact of perceptions of party competence in managing the economy on vote choice and behavior. This growing body of literature underlines the significance of party performance in economic management as a critical determinant of voter behavior."
"This article aims to unify the valence dimensions of economic voting into a single model for incumbent vote. Prior research on the valence model has mainly focused on retrospective evaluations of the economy, overlooking the issue of ownership. However, there have been a few exceptions to this, which we have taken into account. Particularly in the case of an economic crisis, incorporating both of these dimensions seems to be essential. An economic crisis can have a two-part impact on incumbent voting. Firstly, the traditional effect based on retrospective evaluations of the economy, which will inevitably be negative. Secondly, there is an impact based on the public's views on the parties' ability to manage the economy.  The level of influence will be subject to the public's current view, but it could offset incumbent vote losses that result from the poor economic circumstances.","The objective of this article is to integrate the two valence dimensions of economic voting into a cohesive model for incumbent vote. The valence model of economic voting has thus far prioritized the effects of retrospective economic assessments, with little attention given to issue ownership. Yet, some studies have spotlighted this second dimension, which we have incorporated into the model. This is particularly important during an economic crisis. In such a scenario, the effect of the economy on incumbent voting can be expected to have two components. Firstly, there is the traditional contingent that is based on retrospective evaluations of national economic conditions - which in this case, will inevitably be unfavorable. Secondly, there is an effect that is rooted in how the public perceives the parties' management of the economy. Depending on these perceptions, the competence effect may counterbalance any incumbent vote losses that result from the unfavorable economic circumstances.","The goal of this article is to merge the two valence dimensions of economic voting into a unified model for incumbent vote. Past research on the valence model of economic voting has largely neglected the issue of ownership, focusing mainly on retroactive economic evaluations. However, a few studies have highlighted this second aspect, which we have integrated into our model. This is especially pertinent during an economic crisis. In such a situation, we can anticipate that economic voting will have a twofold impact. First, there is the conventional impact that is rooted in retrospective evaluations of national economic conditions, which will inevitably be negative due to the crisis. Second, there is a perception-based effect that is rooted in how the public perceives the parties' management of the economy. Depending on these perceptions, the competence effect may offset any incumbent vote losses that occur as a result of the unfavorable economic situation."
"Utilizing survey-based analyses of the vote that the incumbent Conservative Party of Canada received in the federal elections of 2008 and 2011, we have demonstrated the dual effects empirically. The outcome of both these elections showed that the Conservatives were re-elected, despite the economic crisis context, which implies that the traditional economic voting hypothesis may not be sufficient to explain the role that the economy plays as a valence issue in determining election outcomes.","We have shown the dual effects through empirical evidence obtained from survey-based analyses of the vote for or against the incumbent Conservative Party of Canada in the 2008 and 2011 federal elections. The fact that the Conservative Party managed to win both elections, even with the economic crisis at hand, suggests that the conventional economic voting hypothesis might not be enough to explain the role of the economy as a valence issue in electoral outcomes.","By utilizing survey-based analyses of the vote that the incumbent Conservative Party of Canada received in the federal elections of 2008 and 2011, we have gathered empirical evidence that shows the dual effects. Despite the economic crisis context, the Conservatives were re-elected in both these elections. From this observation, one can infer that the traditional economic voting hypothesis may fall short of explaining the role of the economy as a valence issue in determining election outcomes."
"In Canada, five federal elections coincided with serious economic crises or followed them closely. Notably, in three of these elections (1974, 2008, and 2011), the political incumbent was able to win re-election. In contrast, the incumbents experienced severe losses in the other two elections (1984 and 1993). These outcomes contradict the traditional economic voting theory that predicts the incumbent's defeat in all five elections. The authors seek to explain this phenomenon by distinguishing between two valence dimensions of economic voting: the classic dimension and the issue-ownership dimension. They examine two of the Canadian elections more closely to test their proposed explanation. The following sections provide a more thorough discussion of their theoretical reasoning and expectations.","Canada has seen five federal elections held amidst or just after serious economic crises. Surprisingly, in three of these elections (1974, 2008, and 2011), the incumbent party was successful in securing another term. Conversely, the incumbents suffered humiliating defeats in the other two elections (1984 and 1993). These results contradict the classic economic voting theory that expects the defeat of the incumbent party in all five elections. The authors offer an explanation that is based on two valence dimensions of economic voting, namely the classic dimension, and the issue ownership dimension. They delve deeper into two of the Canadian elections to put their hypothesis through rigorous testing. The subsequent sections elaborate further on their theoretical considerations and expected outcomes.","Over the years, Canada has witnessed five federal elections that were held during, or shortly after, major economic crises. What's interesting is that the incumbent party won three out of the five elections (in 1974, 2008, and 2011) but lost spectacularly in the other two (in 1984 and 1993). This presents a paradoxical situation that contrasts with the conventional economic voting theory that would forecast the loss of the incumbent in each case. In response, the authors of this article have come up with an explanation based on two valence dimensions of economic voting: the traditional dimension and the issue-ownership dimension. Further, they test their hypothesis by studying two of the five Canadian elections in greater detail. The following sections elaborate on their theoretical considerations and envisaged outcomes."
"The economy and incumbent voting are said to be connected according to the principle of government accountability. Governments are held accountable for the evolution of economic conditions, and citizens' approval of the governing party is based on whether the economy is doing well or not. In the past, most studies on the impact of economic conditions on support for incumbent governments have been conducted in the United States. However, research has also revealed a similar relationship in most other Western democracies. Recent comparative studies have been conducted on this topic, examining either the role of institutional arrangements or the level of sophistication among voters to emphasize the conditionality of the economy-vote relationship. Notable studies in this area include Duch and Stevenson's (2008) and Nadeau et al's (2013). Additionally, Powell and Whitten's (1993) and Anderson's (2007) studies focused on the complexity of this relationship.","The existence of a link between the economy and incumbent voting is based on the principle of government accountability. This means that governments are held accountable, to a certain extent, for the economic conditions of their country, and the governing party is rewarded or punished depending on whether they have improved or worsened the economy. The relationship between economic conditions and support for incumbent governments has mainly been studied in the United States, with several studies such as those conducted by Key (1966), Kramer (1971), Fiorina (1981), Kiewiet (1983), and Lewis-Beck (1988). However, similar findings have been discovered in other Western democracies, and recent comparative studies have looked into factors such as institutional arrangements and voters' level of sophistication to better understand the relationship between the economy and voting patterns. Studies by Powell and Whitten (1993) and Anderson (2007) have emphasized the complexity of this relationship.","The theory of a correlation between the economy and incumbent voting is founded on the principle of government accountability. Governments are deemed partly responsible for the state of the economy, and citizens evaluate the performance of the ruling party based on whether the economic conditions have improved or deteriorated.

Key (1966), Kramer (1971), Fiorina (1981), Kiewiet (1983), and Lewis-Beck (1988) have conducted extensive research in this area. Similar relationships have also been explored in several Western democracies, with recent comparative studies examining the role of institutional arrangements and voters' sophistication to enhance our understanding of this connection.

"The 'valence' model of economic voting is the core concept proposed by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011). They differentiate it from the policy-oriented economic voting and patrimonial economic voting models. The policy-oriented economic voting model reflects diverging opinions of voters on economic policies, while patrimonial economic voting depends on the voter's financial assets. The study by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011) shows that economic voting is a multidimensional phenomenon. In this article, we argue that incorporating another dimension, party competence, to the valence model of economic voting would make it multidimensional. Hence, we can infer that the valence model of economic voting is multidimensional.","The fundamental expectation of the 'valence' model of economic voting is proposed by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011). They differentiate it from the policy-oriented economic voting and patrimonial economic voting models.

According to Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2011), economic voting is a multidimensional concept. In this article, we contend that incorporating party competence, another valence dimension, into the valence model of economic voting would make it multidimensional.

"The current valence interpretation of economic voting suggests that voters are primarily concerned with the incumbent party's economic record over the past year or so when making their choice at the ballot box. Valence models of political choice assert that voters take into account the incumbent's relative performance and reputation when deciding which party to vote for. More recently, an increasing number of studies have shed light on another dimension of economic voting, which is related to political parties' image of competence in managing the economy. This perspective has been explored by researchers such as Sanders, Bellucci, Butt, Smith, Martinsson, Bélanger, and Gélineau.","The valence interpretation of economic voting suggests that when citizens cast their ballot, they are primarily concerned with the incumbent party's economic performance in the recent past. Valence models of political choice suggest that voters also consider the incumbent's reputation and comparative performance in deciding which party to vote for.

"During times of financial crisis, the incumbent political party may not have any advantage due to the state of the economy. As a result, they may try to campaign on issues that are not related to the economy or emphasize the economy but present it in a more positive light. This can help the incumbent party project a more favorable image of themselves compared to their opponents, as noted by Nadeau et al (2010) and Vavreck (2009). The economic competence of a party can become a crucial part of their campaign message during such a time.","If a financial crisis occurs and the state of the economy doesn't provide any advantage to the incumbent party, they may choose to focus on a different campaign issue altogether or reframe the economy in a more favorable way to create a positive image, as suggested by Nadeau et al (2010) and Vavreck (2009). Therefore, the economic competence of a political party can be a crucial component of their election campaign message.","During an economic crisis, incumbent political parties may not have an advantage due to the state of the economy.

"The economy's valence dimension has two parts, one of which is retrospective. This aspect is different from the traditional dimension as it has a comparative approach. While the typical dimension only considers the current party's economic record, the competence dimension evaluates their economic performance in comparison to other economies. The voter's question is whether the country's economy is performing better than comparable economies when facing difficulties. If it does, then the incumbent party is still viewed positively, despite the crisis context and the impact on the national economy. This process of comparison is called benchmarking by Kayser and Peress (2012), and Duch and Stevenson (2010) refer to it as voters extracting information about the government's relative economic competence.","The economy's valence dimension is composed of two parts, one of which is retrospective. However, it distinguishes itself from the traditional dimension in one crucial way. The usual aspect only takes into account the incumbent party's economic record, while the competence dimension has a comparative approach. This involves evaluating the economic performance of the incumbent party in light of other economies. The voter's question becomes whether the country's economy performs better than comparable economies, even during difficult times. If the answer is yes, then the incumbent party is well-regarded, even in the midst of a crisis context and its effects on the national economy. Kayser and Peress (2012) called this cognitive process ""benchmarking,"" while Duch and Stevenson (2010) conceptualize it as voters extracting cues about the government's relative economic competence.","The economy's valence dimension is comprised of two aspects, with the second one being retrospective. However, this dimension has a distinct feature that sets it apart from the traditional valence dimension. While the typical dimension only considers the economic record of the incumbent party, the competence dimension follows a comparative approach. It assesses the economic performance of the incumbent party in comparison to other economies. The key question for the voter becomes whether the nation's economy, despite challenging situations, is performing better than comparable economies. If the answer is affirmative, the voter concludes that the incumbent party has performed well despite the crisis context and its impact on the national economy. This cognitive process is known as benchmarking, as Kayser and Peress (2012) affirm, and as voters extracting information about the government's economic competency relative to other countries, as conceptualised by Duch and Stevenson (2010)."
"Issue ownership has a competence-based component that depends on how well political parties handle particular issues. It can be evaluated through performance comparison and benchmarking, especially in the context of the economy. However, this aspect must not be mistaken with the ""associative"" component of issue ownership that stems from a party's attention history to specific issues via policy priorities, which has less to do with performance itself. This distinction between the valence and policy dimensions of issue ownership parallels the previous section's discussion between the conventional economic voting hypothesis and Kiewiet's policy-oriented view of economic voting. For more information on this critical distinction, check out Walgrave et al's 2012 research.","The competence-based part of issue ownership pertains to how well political parties can handle particular issues. It can be assessed via comparison and benchmarking, particularly in economic matters. This element is separate from the ""associative"" side of issue ownership, which concerns a party's history of attention to specific issues through their policies. This component is less involved with performance per se. It's worth noting that this distinction between the valence and policy dimensions of issue ownership is comparable to the conventional economic voting hypothesis versus Kiewiet's policy-oriented perspective of economic voting discussed in the previous section. If you want to learn more about this critical distinction, read Walgrave et al's 2012 study.","Issue ownership includes a competence-based component that depends on how well political parties manage specific issues.

"We contend, following Martinsson (2009, p. 230), that issue ownership plays a significant role in accounting for why incumbents may not be penalized for poor economic performance. Although other studies have attempted to explain this phenomenon, they have tended to zero in on/contextual factors (as summarized in Anderson, 2007) rather than examining how parties' perception of economic management influences economic voting. Issue ownership represents another critical element in this regard.","We share the view of Martinsson (2009, p. 230) that issue ownership is a crucial factor that contributes to why incumbents are not held accountable for objectively poor economic performances. Despite numerous studies that have aimed to explain this trend, many have concentrated on institutional and contextual aspects (as reviewed in Anderson, 2007), rather than the parties' image as competent economic managers. We believe that issue ownership is an additional influential component that is integral to understanding economic voting.","Along with Martinsson (2009, p. 230), we contend that issue ownership is an important factor that contributes to why incumbents are not penalized for poor economic performance, as opposed to what objective measures indicate. Although several studies have attempted to elucidate this phenomenon, many have focused on different institutional and contextual aspects instead of examining the parties' perception as competent economic managers (as outlined in Anderson, 2007). We believe that issue ownership is a critical piece of the puzzle necessary to comprehend economic voting."
"Our study aims to explore how perceptions of competence in managing the economy influenced incumbent voting during the 2008 and 2011 Canadian federal elections. According to our hypothesis, if voters saw the incumbent party as the most competent at managing the economy, they would be more likely to vote for the Conservative Party, while perceiving an opposition party as the most competent would decrease support. Previous research conducted by Bélanger and Gélineau in the 2008 Quebec election and Martinsson's study on six Swedish national elections primarily focused on the specific issue of unemployment. In contrast, our research examines the concept of competence in the economy more broadly defined, for two consecutive Canadian national elections.","The 2008 and 2011 Canadian federal elections were potentially influenced by voters' perceptions of political parties' competence in managing the economy. Our study explores this possibility and suggests that voters who viewed the incumbent party as the most competent in economic management are more likely to support the Conservative Party while voters who believed that the opposition parties were more competent would not support them. Previous studies by Bélanger and Gélineau on the 2008 Quebec election and Martinsson's research on six Swedish national elections examined similar effects but focused on specific issues, such as unemployment. In contrast, our study examines the general concept of economic competence over two consecutive Canadian national elections.","The Canadian federal elections of 2008 and 2011 might have been influenced by voters' perception of the political parties' competence in handling economic affairs. Our research delves deeper into this possibility and argues that voters are more likely to support the Conservative Party if they view the incumbent party as competent in economic management, while they are less likely to support a party in opposition if they are perceived as less competent. Bélanger and Gélineau, in their study of the 2008 Quebec election, and Martinsson in their research on six Swedish national elections, both looked at similar effects but focused on specific issues, such as unemployment. Our investigation, on the other hand, studies the broader scope of economic competence over two consecutive Canadian national elections."
"We have employed two indicators to measure the sociotropic economic assessments retrospectively. Initially, the classic measure based on a regular question is utilized which asks if the Canadian economy is in a better, worse, or same state as last year (better = +1, same = 0, worse = ?1). This measure is expected to captivate the traditional economic voting effect. However, when investigating the economic voting in the 2008 Canadian election, Gidengil et al (2012, p. 77) found the effect of this measure was weak. They contend that voters did not hold the Conservative government responsible for the economic downturn as the financial crisis originated primarily in the United States (Gidengil et al, 2012, pp. 79–82). Therefore, we have proposed a second measure of retrospective economic evaluations, which considers responsibility attribution. This measure weighs the original economic perception variable based on whether respondents attribute the responsibility for favorable or unfavorable economic conditions to the government's policies.","Two measures have been utilized to gauge retrospective sociotropic economic assessments.

"The measure of political parties' economic management competency in the study is based on responses to the question ""Which political party do you think can best handle the economy?"". The competency variable was coded as +1 for the Conservative Party, -1 for another party, and 0 if the respondents did not name any party as competent, if all parties are considered competent, or if they are unsure. The study employed a split-sample experiment where the question was only asked to half of the sample in the 2008 survey. The other half was asked about job creation, as this issue is relevant to the economic crisis context. The researchers included the aspect of job creation in their analysis as an additional evidence of economic voting through competency assessments. This coding methodology was similar to studies by Bélanger and Meguid (2008); Bélanger and Gélineau (2011).","In the study, the researchers used responses to the question ""Which party do you believe would be best equipped to handle the economy?"" to measure people's perceptions of political parties' competency as economic managers.

"The 2008 Canadian federal election was scheduled by Prime Minister Stephen Harper just before the economic crisis erupted in the US housing and financial markets. Canadian citizens went for voting on October 14th while acknowledging the economic turmoil happening worldwide and being aware of the Canadian economy's slowdown and the likelihood of collapse in the coming months. According to the CES survey data, 81% of non-Quebec respondents considered the economy a crucial issue in the election, while another 17% thought it was a relatively important topic. It was apparent that the economic downturn had affected the opinion of people about the state of Canada's economy. 46% of respondents thought that the economy had worsened in the past year, 39% deemed it had remained the same, and just 14% felt that the situation had gotten better. According to the traditional economic voting hypothesis, these negative economic views should have negatively impacted the incumbent Conservatives.","Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced the 2008 Canadian federal election right before the economic crisis in the American housing and financial markets unfolded. With the Canadian economy already beginning to slow down and on the verge of collapsing, people who went to the polls on October 14th had in mind the crisis context. According to the CES data, around 81% of respondents outside Quebec considered the economy as a critical issue in that election, while an additional 17% said it was somewhat important. The start of the economic downturn led to a negative outlook among people toward Canada's economy. About 46% of respondents believed that the economy had deteriorated over the past year, with less than 14% saying that it had improved. The traditional economic voting hypothesis would suggest that these negative evaluations of the economy would have hurt the incumbent Conservatives.","Just before the economic crisis erupted in the US housing and financial markets, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced the 2008 Canadian federal election.

"In the regression model presented in Column 2 of Table 1, the traditional 3-point measure of past economic assessments is replaced by the 5-point economic responsibility measure. Both indicators have been standardized to run from ?1 to +1. According to the results, economic voting is just as significant as in the first model when using the economic responsibility indicator, which is consistent with Gidengil et al's (2012) intuition about economic voting in the 2008 Canadian election. An incumbent government cannot be fully responsible for a country's declining economic conditions during a global economic crisis. Only voters who blame the government's policies, and not the government itself, are expected to vote against it, which is what the economic responsibility indicator attempts to capture. In the 2008 Canadian election, economic voting occurred and negatively impacted the incumbent party since most Canadian voters believed that economic conditions had worsened or at least had not improved. However, the economic voting was strongest among a smaller group of people who attributed credit or blame to the government's policies, with everything else being equal.","The regression model in Column 2 of Table 1 replaces the traditional 3-point measure of past economic assessments with the 5-point economic responsibility measure, though both indicators are standardized to range from ?1 to +1. The outcomes indicate that economic voting is just as significant as in the first model when utilizing the economic responsibility indicator, which coincides with Gidengil et al's (2012) ideas regarding economic voting in the context of the 2008 Canadian election. In the midst of a global economic crisis, a governing party can't be wholly responsible for a country's declining economic conditions. Only voters who attribute the blame to the government's policies, and not the government itself, are anticipated to vote against it, which is what the economic responsibility indicator aims to catch. Economic voting occurred in the 2008 Canadian election, and it negatively affected the incumbent party since a majority of Canadian voters believed that economic conditions had deteriorated or failed to improve. However, such voting was strongest among a smaller group of individuals who linked credit or blame to the government's policies, assuming all else to be equal.","The 5-point economic responsibility measure replaces the traditional 3-point measure of past economic assessments in Column 2 of Table 1's regression model. Besides, both indicators get standardized to range from ?1 to +1. The outcome confirms that economic voting is still considerable with the use of the economic responsibility indicator. This is in line with Gidengil et al.'s (2012) thoughts on economic voting within the 2008 Canadian election context. An incumbent government cannot incur full responsibility for a country's deteriorating economic conditions during a global economic crisis. It would help if you held only voters responsible who blame the government's policies and not the administration per se if they choose to vote against it. This is what the economic responsibility indicator endeavours to capture.  In 2008, economic voting did happen, which negatively impacted the incumbent party since most Canadian voters thought that economic conditions had declined, or at least had not improved. Yet, the voting occurred the most strongly when a relatively smaller group interpreted the government's policies' credit or blame, with everything else being equal."
"The minute difference between the two models in Table 1 indicates that responsibility attributions have a relatively insignificant impact on the traditional economic voting effect. The addition of responsibility attributions does offer a crucial aspect to the effect but doesn't substantially enhance the model's explanatory power. As previously mentioned in the article, relying solely on retrospective economic perceptions to understand economic voting is insufficient, particularly during financial crises. Accordingly, the hypothesis suggests that party competence at managing the economy during bad times can either counteract economic perceptions or reinforce them.","Although the two models in Table 1 have a very small difference in terms of model fit, the contribution of responsibility attributions to the traditional economic voting effect is not very significant. While responsibility attributions do add nuance to the effect, they do not significantly increase the model's explanatory power. From the beginning of the article, the authors suggest that relying solely on retrospective economic perceptions is not enough to fully explain economic voting, especially during times of financial crisis. As predicted, perceptions of party competence in managing the economy can either reinforce or counteract economic perceptions during hard times.","Despite the slight difference in model fit between the two models in Table 1, it seems that responsibility attributions have a modest impact on the traditional economic voting effect. Responsibility attributions provide some crucial perspective on the effect, but they do not substantially improve the model's explanatory power. As noted early on in the article, relying on retrospective economic perceptions only offers an incomplete understanding of economic voting, especially in financial crises. As hypothesized, perceptions of a political party's competencies in terms of economic management during difficult times may have either a mitigating effect or a strengthening effect on economic viewpoints."
"The researchers examine the influence of the two valence dimensions of economic voting on the likelihood of supporting the incumbent party, while controlling for other factors. To provide a more tangible illustration, the authors translate their findings into marginal effects using their logistic regression results. This is done for the enhanced valence model of economic voting applied in 2008, but similar outcomes are observed when using the 2011 regression results or the job creation model of 2008. While holding all other independent variables at their average levels, the authors adjust the values of retrospective national economic assessments (weighted by responsibility attribution) and party competence on the economy and calculate the corresponding change in the expected probability of voting for the incumbent party. The simulation results are recorded in Table 8.","The impact of the two valence dimensions of economic voting on the likelihood of supporting the incumbent party is analyzed by the researchers; they control for other factors that could influence the results. The authors then present the findings in terms of marginal effects, derived from the logistic regression results. Although the primary focus is on the enhanced valence model of economic voting from 2008, similar results are obtained for both the 2011 regression results and the 2008 job creation model. By keeping all other independent variables constant, except for the retrospective national economic evaluations (weighted by responsibility attribution) and party competence on the economy, the authors assess the change in the predicted probability of voting for the incumbent party. Table 8 presents the simulation results.","The researchers aim to determine the extent to which the two valence dimensions of economic voting affect the probability of supporting the incumbent party, while controlling for other variables. To make the findings more concrete, the results are converted into marginal effects using logistic regression. While the enhanced valence model of economic voting from 2008 is used as the basis for this analysis, the results are comparable when using the 2011 regression results or the 2008 job creation model. The authors adjust the retrospective national economic evaluations and party competence on the economy while maintaining all other independent variables at their average levels to calculate the corresponding change in the expected probability of voting for the incumbent party. The simulation results are presented in Table 8."
"The standard approach of neoclassical economics does not include the concepts of economic emergence and entrepreneurship, which we believe should not be ignored. We explore the reasons why entrepreneurship, one of the most important economic behaviors, is largely disregarded in mainstream economic theory. Conversely, evolutionary economists have recognized the importance of understanding emergence, and we examine the progress that has been made in this field. Additionally, we suggest that evolutionary economics can further advance by taking a more ""naturalistic"" perspective on economic evolution. This necessitates that economic analysis be fully incorporated into the framework of complex economic system theory and that we explicitly handle associated notions about how humans respond to states of uncertainty. We argue that knowledge is largely conjectural because of the presence of uncertainty and that it is closely tied to our emotional states. Our economic behavior is also influenced by the fact that we and the systems we create are dissipative structures. As a result, we introduce the ideas of ""energy gradients"" and ""knowledge gradients"" as crucial concepts for understanding economic emergence and resulting economic growth.","The traditional approach of neoclassical economics defines economic emergence and entrepreneurship as irrelevant, which we strongly disagree with.

"Conventional neoclassical economics is built on the belief that people make rational decisions based on the principle of constrained optimization. This theory has been expanded to account for strategic interactions, but much of macroeconomics still employs it in the context of a single ""representative agent."" While this rule provides analytical precision, it only works in cases where there is certainty or quantifiable risk, which are simplistic contexts. When there is uncertainty, such as a lack of knowledge about events or their probabilities, the rule is insufficient. In these cases, economic behavior continues to occur via creative and cooperative processes that can result in the emergence of new network structures with unique attributes.","Neoclassical economics is based on the assumption that economic decision-making follows a logic that is constrained by optimization rules. This principle has increasingly been seen in the context of strategic interactions over the past 30 years. However, macroeconomics mostly relies on the assumption of a single ""representative agent."" Although this rule is precise for calculating data, it only applies to simplistic situations where there is certainty or quantifiable risks. It fails when it comes to predicting economic decision-making under uncertainty, where there is no knowledge of events or the probabilities involved. Despite this, economic behavior continues to emerge, producing creative and cooperative responses, and network structures that are irreducible to their underlying elements.","Neoclassical economics centers on the idea that economic decision-making is driven by constrained optimization using cold logic. While this rule has gained popularity in the context of strategic interactions, macroeconomics still relies on the assumption of a single ""representative agent."" It is essential to recognize that this rule's precision can only work in situations of certainty or quantifiable risk, which are simplistic. Economic decision-making under uncertainty, where the events or their probabilities are unknown, cannot be predicted by following the optimization rule. However, economic behavior is observed to occur through creative and cooperative processes, giving rise to economic emergence and new network structures with unique characteristics."
"Evolutionary economics is a school of thought that directly deals with economic emergence. The field is primarily focused on how economic systems transform from within. Since evolutionary theory is based on the concept of change, it includes a set of behavioural rules adopted and applied by economic decision-makers. For instance, Nelson and Winter (1982) emphasized the importance of behavioural routines in this regard. This is because economic agents have to operate in historical time, which comes with a lot of uncertainties. In evolutionary economics, economic agents are considered to be reducing the uncertainty they face by pursuing bundles of rules that lead to economic goals. Economic emergence happens when new bundles of radical rules produce technological capital goods, productive networks, institutional contracting systems, and procedural skills. This evolutionary process is facilitated through self-organization, sharpened further by competitive selection, where various technologies, organizational structures, institutions, and procedures become dominant.","Economic emergence is a subject that has been addressed most directly by evolutionary economics. This area of study is concerned with understanding how economic systems undergo transformations from within. As evolutionary theory is inherently focused on change, it encompasses a range of behavioural rules that are adopted and applied by economic decision-makers. Nelson and Winter (1982) underscored the centrality of behavioural routines since economic agents have to operate in historical time where there are many uncertainties. In evolutionary economics, economic agents reduce the uncertainties they face and accomplish their economic goals by adhering to bundles of rules. Economic emergence occurs when radically new bundles of rules come together to create capital goods, productive networks, institutional contracting systems, and procedural skills. This process of self-organization is further refined through competitive selection, whereby specific technologies, organizational structures, institutions, and procedures come to dominate.","When it comes to the discussion on economic emergence, evolutionary economics has directly addressed this topic.

"Understanding economic emergence requires an understanding of the genetic and culturally learned drivers of human behavior, as well as their interaction with the energy requirements of living systems. To analyze economic behavior, institutions and how they change alongside changing circumstances must also be considered. Traditional economic analysis shouldn't be disregarded, but instead, the limits of calculative behavior should be recognized. Evolutionary theories prioritize diversity of behavior over uniformity, as every individual has their different ways of responding to information. Therefore, the question of whether behavior is optimal according to logical criteria comes second to comprehending the scope of personal responses to available information.","To gain an understanding of economic emergence, it's essential to understand both the genetic and cultural drivers of human behavior and how these interplay with the energy requirements of living systems. To evaluate economic behavior, we need to understand the different institutional rules that humans adopt in their various cultures and how these change over time. We don't need to reject typical economic analyses because humans try to make the best decisions they can, given their circumstances. The primary issue isn't optimization, but rather the limitations of our ability to calculate optimal choices combined with the many diverse ways individuals respond to available information. In all evolutionary theories, the focus is on the diversity of behavior rather than conformity to a set norm. Therefore, the question isn't whether a specific behavior is optimal but more about understanding the range of ways individuals can respond to information.","The comprehension of economic emergence necessitates an understanding of both the genetic and culturally acquired drivers of human behavior and their interactions with the energy requirements of dissipative systems. To analyze economic behavior, it is crucial to understand the institutional rules that individuals adopt and how these rules can change with changing circumstances. However, traditional economic analysis should not be disregarded since humans try to make the best choices possible within their means. The primary issue should not be whether or not the behaviors are optimized, but the limitations of calculative behavior and the various ways individuals respond to the information available to them. Evolutionary theories prioritize the diversity of behaviors over conformity to any particular standard. Consequently, understanding the range of ways individuals can respond to information is more important than if such behavior is optimal according to logical criteria."

"In the 1950s, the field of economics began to move towards a logical framework that did not allow for emergence. This meant that important drivers of economic growth were ignored in favor of a ""force field"" representation of a fully connected network system borrowed from physics in the 19th century. At the time, it did not appear that this economic approach would become dominant. Critics of neoclassical economics - such as the Keynesian Revolution - had already raised questions about its ability to accurately represent economic behavior. While non-neoclassical models of medium-term business cycles and economic growth, such as the Harrod-Domar model, gained popularity in macroeconomics, neoclassical economics remained dominant in microeconomics.","In the 1950s, economics shifted towards a logical framework that couldn't account for emergent phenomena.

At the time, it wasn't expected that this economic theory would become predominant. Critics of neoclassical economics, like the Keynesian Revolution, had already questioned its efficacy in representing economic behavior. Although macroeconomics at the time leaned towards non-neoclassical models like the medium-term multiplier-accelerator representation of the business cycle, neoclassical economics remained the core of microeconomics. Harrod's theory of economic growth became the standard, with the Harrod-Domar model as the favored approach in planning for economic development.","During the 1950s, the field of economics adopted a logical framework that was inconsistent with emergent phenomena. This meant that critical drivers of economic evolution and development were overlooked in place of a mathematical model of constrained optimization, represented in a ""force field"" depiction of a fully connected network system that was based on 19th-century physics (Mirowski (1989) and Potts (2000)). At the time, it was not expected that this type of economic analysis would become mainstream. The so-called ""Keynesian revolution"" had already cast doubts on neoclassical economics as a reliable model of economic behavior. Although macroeconomics had shifted towards non-neoclassical models of business cycles and economic growth in the short, medium, and long term, such as the medium-term multiplier-accelerator representation and Harrod's theory of economic growth and the related Harrod-Domar model, neoclassical economics remained the paradigm in microeconomics."
"Neoclassical economists believed that a better understanding of the microfoundations of macroeconomics was the key to dealing with technological change in growth models. This perspective gained popularity after the neoclassical synthesis interpretation of Keynesian economics, first promoted by John Hicks, was widely accepted following Keynes' death. Consequently, neoclassical economists had an easy time advancing into business cycle and growth theory, despite the complexity and lack of empirical evidence in the mathematical models that had emerged. To address this, neoclassical economists relied on the simplification of representative optimizing agents, which were easy to understand and apply, provided that they made strong assumptions. However, these models failed to account for economic emergence, as they did not consider the role of entrepreneurs, differentiated firms, or the Marshallian flux, as discussed by Metcalfe in 2007.","To tackle technological change in their growth models, neoclassical economists believed that improving the microfoundations of macroeconomics was necessary. This viewpoint emerged after the Keynesian model's neoclassical synthesis interpretation gained popularity following Keynes' death. As a result, neoclassical economists found it relatively easy to advance into business cycle and growth theory in the subsequent decades, despite the complex and often-ambiguous mathematical models they encountered. Neoclassical economists attempted to bypass these challenges by developing simple, representative optimizing agent foundations. These foundations were easy to understand and apply, provided that they made specific simplifying assumptions. However, they failed to consider economic emergence, such as the role of entrepreneurs, differentiated firms, and the Marshallian flux, characterizing economic activity, as pointed out by Metcalfe in 2007.","Neoclassical economists posited that the key to addressing technological changes in growth models was to improve the microfoundations of macroeconomics. This perspective gained credence following the neoclassical synthesis interpretation of Keynesian economics propagated by John Hicks, which became widely embraced after Keynes' death. This made it relatively easy for neoclassical economists to advance into business cycle and growth theory over the next few decades, despite the mathematical models being untidy, complex, oftentimes without equilibrium solutions, and difficult to verify empirically. Neoclassical economists decided to circumvent these complexities by resorting to simple analytical foundations featuring a representative optimizing agent. These foundations were easy to understand but relied on strong simplifying assumptions to be applicable. Unfortunately, these theories failed to account for economic emergence, as they did not take Schumpeter's entrepreneur, the Marshallian flux, or the differentiated firm into account, according to Metcalfe (2007)."
"The field of economics focused on constrained optimization and scientific recognition in the latter half of the 20th century, leading to the replacement of intellectual stalwarts Marshall, Veblen, and Schumpeter by Samuelson, Arrow, and Debreu. This shift came at a cost, disconnecting economics from economic emergence and limiting the importance placed on behavioral traits beyond conventional neoclassical rationality. The aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis revealed the shortcomings of this approach. Keynes had foresightedly argued for considering the impact of animal spirits or waves of optimism and pessimism that influence business investment and ultimately contribute to economic fluctuations. However, neoclassical synthesis overlooked this concept, and the Keynesian explanation became simplified to a story of labor market failure in an otherwise well-functioning (non-)neoclassical world.","The economic field underwent a significant transformation in the latter half of the 20th century, putting emphasis on constrained optimization and scientific identity, and leading to the intellectual displacement of Marshall, Veblen, and Schumpeter by Samuelson, Arrow, and Debreu. However, this approach neglected the significance of economic emergence and the importance of behavioral traits that exceeded the boundaries of narrow neoclassical rationality. The myopic focus on conventional ideas of rationality partly contributed to the failure of economists to predict the 2008 global financial crisis. Keynes had earlier recognized the role of 'animal spirits' in driving business investment and causing fluctuations in economic growth, but the neoclassical synthesis overlooked this concept, instead depicting the Keynesian explanation as labor market failure in an otherwise well-functioning non-neoclassical world.","In the latter half of the 20th century, the economics discipline underwent a fundamental shift towards constrained optimization and scientific credibility. The intellectual torchbearers in the field changed from Veblen, Marshall, and Schumpeter to Samuelson, Arrow, and Debreu. However, this move came at a cost, cutting economics off from economic emergence and neglecting the significance of behavioral traits that did not conform to traditional neoclassical rationality. This failure of neoclassical economics came to light following the 2008 financial crisis with economists unable to foresee the impending danger. Decades earlier, Keynes had argued that business investments were influenced by 'animal spirits,' resulting in waves of optimism and pessimism responsible for economic fluctuations. But the neoclassical synthesis ignored this idea, instead simplifying the Keynesian explanation as a case of labor market failure amidst an otherwise successful non-neoclassical world."
"Endogenous growth theorists in the 1990s proposed that Solow's unexplained residual could be clarified by introducing ""knowledge"" as a production factor with unique qualities that result in economies of scale or externalities. This approach relies on neoclassical principles and involves generating a ""stock"" of knowledge through research and development, incentivizing scientists to discover inventions that may be transformed into new capital equipment sold to consumer goods producers. Despite its explanatory intentions, the equilibrium endogenous growth theory fails to explain the process of economic emergence, and it overlooks entrepreneurship as the main driving force behind economic growth. As usual, the theory's assumptions and functional types must be cleverly crafted to make the theory work; nonetheless, it only explains evident observations such as the significance of investing in education, encouraging innovation, and the benefits of socially useful patents while discouraging excessive protection.","In the early 1990s, endogenous growth theorists posited that Solow's unexplained residual could be accounted for by introducing ""knowledge"" as an extra production factor with unique attributes that give rise to economies of scale or externalities. This thinking is based on neoclassical principles and entails creating a ""stock"" of knowledge through research and development, incentivizing scientists to discover inventions that could be turned into new capital equipment marketed to consumer goods producers. However, the equilibrium endogenous growth theory falls short of explaining the process of economic emergence despite its explanatory intent and pays little attention to entrepreneurship as the primary catalyst for economic growth. As always, it requires clever assumptions and functional structures to work, but it merely confirms what we already know: investing in education and training is critical, promoting innovation is essential, and patents are helpful but should not be overly protective.","By the early 1990s, the advocates of endogenous growth theory had proposed that Solow's inexplicable residual could be clarified by supplementing ""knowledge"" as an extra production factor with distinct features that bring forth economies of scale or externalities. In this neoclassical-based framework, a ""stock"" of knowledge is created by research and development, motivating researchers to discover innovations that can be transformed into new capital equipment for sale to firms that produce consumer goods. However, the equilibrium endogenous growth theory fails to clarify the process of economic emergence, despite its attempts to be explanatory, and largely overlooks entrepreneurship as the primary driving force behind economic growth. As usual, the theory's assumptions and functional forms must be carefully selected to make it work effectively, but it only confirms what we already know: investing in education and training is crucial, promoting innovation is necessary, and patents have social benefits, but excessive protection is undesirable."
"The representation of emergent processes such as competition and innovation through mathematical models only captures ""weak"" emergence and fails to completely account for ""strong"" emergence, which describes more radical innovations and entrepreneurial activities. Emergent processes and the economic growth paths they follow have a deterministic component, as they operate within dissipative structures that need to remain structurally coherent over extended periods of time. This structural coherence can be estimated mathematically through econometrics, but it still does not fully capture the evolutionary process that involves structural change. As such, statistical residuals within a logistic diffusion model that has been estimated econometrically contain both the non-deterministic components of an emergence process, in addition to normal Gaussian stochasticity.","Mathematical models are capable of representing emergent processes like competition and innovation, but they can only capture their ""weak"" emergence, not the more radical ""strong"" emergence seen in Schumpeterian innovation and associated entrepreneurship. Because economic systems are dissipative structures, they must remain structurally coherent and have a deterministic component for economic growth to occur. This persistence has a mathematical structure that can be estimated with econometrics but still provides an incomplete representation of an evolution process that involves structural change. Therefore, statistical residuals in a logistic diffusion model estimated with econometrics contain all of the non-deterministic components of an emergence process, in addition to normal Gaussian stochasticity.","While mathematical models can represent emergent processes, such as competition and innovation, they only capture ""weak"" emergence and not the more extreme ""strong"" emergence involved in Schumpeterian radical innovation and entrepreneurial endeavors. Economic systems are dissipative structures, and to achieve economic growth, they must remain coherent with a deterministic component. This structural coherence can be mathematically estimated using econometrics, but it does not give a complete representation of the evolutionary process that includes structural changes. Consequently, data residuals in a logistic diffusion model estimated econometrically include all non-deterministic components involved in an emergence process, besides the expected normal Gaussian stochasticity."
"Evolutionary economics has effectively dealt with weak emergence in both its theory and application, suggesting that it is an adept field. It is also recognized that strong emergence serves as the origin of economic growth and development. Although Joseph Schumpeter's work established the creation of novelty through entrepreneurship as the critical catalyst for economic emergence, evolutionary economists face analytical difficulties in dealing with it. Therefore, this area necessitates further research to produce a thorough analysis of economic emergence.","Evolutionary economists have demonstrated skill in addressing weak emergence both in their theories and in empirical applications, indicating a high level of competence in the field. It is also acknowledged that economic evolution and growth are sourced from strong emergence, and the significance of this phenomenon is well understood. Although the pioneering work of Joseph Schumpeter established that entrepreneurship plays a pivotal role in generating novelty and promoting economic emergence, evolutionary economists continue to experience analytical challenges in dealing with the concept. Therefore, further research and development are needed to achieve a comprehensive understanding of economic emergence.","The work of evolutionary economists has proven successful in tackling weak emergence in both its theoretical and empirical aspects, demonstrating a high level of proficiency in this particular field. Moreover, it has been widely accepted that strong emergence is the crucial source of economic evolution and growth, and this concept is well understood. Although Joseph Schumpeter's seminal work has established that entrepreneurship is the catalyst for economic emergence, it remains analytically difficult for evolutionary economists to handle. Thus, this aspect of evolutionary economics requires further investigation and advancement before a comprehensive understanding of economic emergence can be reached."
"The concept of emergence states that a whole is greater than the sum of its parts, an idea that has been acknowledged in mainstream economics. In evolutionary economics and business strategy, the analysis of this phenomenon is focused on the operation of entrepreneurship. Venturesome individuals or teams establish connections between various components such as machines, individuals who have skills, and utilize organizational rules and energy sources successfully. Evolutionary economists have contributed to the field by conducting case studies or implementing agent-based simulations to expand their knowledge on this topic. (Examples can be found in studies such as Malerba et al (2001) and Foster and Potts (2009)).","The idea of emergence suggests that a whole entity is greater than the sum of its individual parts. This has been a long-standing notion recognized in mainstream economics, where it is discussed in terms of economies of scale and scope, learning curvess, and experience. However, this concept is usually kept separate from the theory of constrained optimization. In evolutionary economics and business strategy, analysis of emergence focuses on entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial individuals or groups take on the challenging task of establishing networks of connections between various elements such as machines, people, organizational rules, and energy sources. Researchers have explored this topic through case studies or agent-based simulations, such as those conducted by Malerba et al (2001) and Foster and Potts (2009).","Emergence is based on the idea that a whole is greater than the sum of its parts, a concept that has long been accepted in mainstream economics.

In contrast, evolutionary economics and business strategy analyze the emergence process, focusing on the role of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial people or teams in organizations work hard to establish networks of connections between elements, including machines, people with various skills, organizational rules, and affordable energy sources. This field has seen various contributions, including case studies or agent-based simulations, such as those conducted by Malerba et al (2001) and Foster and Potts (2009)."
"Companies can become locked in a historical pattern of operating because of their successful physical, cultural, conceptual, and organizational structure. This lock-in can limit a firm's ability to adapt and presents an evolutionary dilemma. Tighter connections increase efficiency but make adaptation more challenging, while looser specialized connections are less efficient but offer more flexibility. There is more adaptive potential in industries and economies as a whole than in individual firms, making an overly rational neoclassical approach a disadvantage. This is exemplified by the case of IBM, which had to create a separate branch to innovate and create personal computers, as their highly efficient model made it challenging to adapt. Complexity theory also highlights the importance of suboptimal behavior in individual components, recognizing that optimizing a system as a whole may require trade-offs.","When a company has built a successful physical, cultural, conceptual, and organizational structure, it can become stuck in this pattern, known as a historical lock-in, which places limits on its ability to adapt. This creates an evolutionary dilemma - tighter specialized connections can create more efficient networks, but also make it harder to adjust when needed. Looser groups of unspecialized individuals may be more flexible, but less productive. There is typically more room for adaptation within an industry rather than any individual firm, causing an overemphasis on rational neoclassical approaches to be a disadvantage. IBM is a standard example of a highly efficient organization which struggled to adapt to changing market conditions, despite its organizational excellence. To overcome this hurdle, a separate branch was created to enable them to innovate and create personal computers. Complexity theory recognizes that optimizing a system often requires suboptimal behavior in individual components, a trade-off between system-wide and individual-level optimization.","Companies that have built a sound physical, cultural, conceptual, and organizational structure may become locked into this pattern, known as a historical lock-in, which may impede their ability to adapt. This presents an evolutionary dilemma - tighter specialized connections may enhance efficiency but can make adjustment more difficult. Conversely, looser groups of unspecialized individuals may be more adaptable but less productive. The industry as a whole typically has more adaptive potential than any single company, making an overly rational neoclassical approach a significant disadvantage. For example, IBM achieved high levels of organizational efficiency but struggled to adapt to market dynamics, leading to the creation of a separate branch to innovate and create personal computers. Complexity theory suggests that optimizing a system as a whole usually involves suboptimal behavior within individual components, which implies a trade-off between individual-level and system-wide optimization."
"The Indian economy has undergone changes in its policy structure as it has taken steps to open up the economy further while reducing government control. This study tests the hypothesis that the level of economic growth in India, which is a federal system with different business regulations, taxation, and government spending across states, is positively impacted by greater economic freedom. Using a pooled linear regression model to analyze categorical data, this study measures economic freedom and its three components as independent variables and income per capita growth rates and gross state domestic product growth as the dependent variable for 20 states in three time periods- 2004/2005, 2006/2007, and 2009/2010. This study also incorporates income per capita, literacy rate, sectoral composition, and inflation rate to control the impact of other factors. The results suggest that economic freedom has a significant impact on economic growth in India, and the size of the government, the strength of the rule of law, and flexible regulations in governing credit, labor, and product markets are key factors impacting income growth.","As India opens up its economy with less government control, the policy structure has undergone changes.

This study controls for other variables like initial income per capita, literacy rate, sectoral composition, and inflation rate. The study results show that economic freedom has a primary role in promoting economic growth in India. The size of the government, the strength of the rule of law, and flexible regulations governing credit, labor, and product markets contribute significantly to income growth.","The Indian economy's recent moves towards greater openness and lesser government control have resulted in changes to its policy structure.

Control variables such as initial income per capita, literacy rate, sectoral composition, and inflation rate are considered in the study. The study reveals that economic freedom plays an essential role in fostering economic growth in India. In particular, the size of the government, a strong rule of law, and flexible regulations governing credit, labor, and product markets have positive effects on income growth."
"Market-oriented policies have long been acknowledged as a means of driving economic development (Berggren 2003). The building of market institutions and widespread market liberalization are key components of the Washington Consensus (World Bank 2002), which aims to reduce excessive government intervention in economies through adjustment programs, such as those implemented by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Market-based institutions are essential in effectively transmitting information, supporting property rights and agreements, and enforcing competition in such a way that they influence economic development (De Vanssay and Spindler 1994; Alesina 1998; De Haan and Siermann 1998; Nelson and Singh 1998) - this is supported by the World Bank (2002). These institutions are designed to foster economic freedom by providing incentives for growth, such as low taxation, a legally independent system and the safeguarding of private property (Murphy et al. 1991; Gwartney 2009). They facilitate the creation of adaptable and structured economies with emphasis on free and fair competition through effective regulation, which results in fewer government-owned entities (Johansson 2001).","According to Berggren (2003), market-driven reforms are integral in fostering economic development. The Washington Consensus (World Bank 2002) highlights market liberalization and the creation of market-based institutions as critical components of promoting economic growth by limiting government intervention in economies through adjustment programs like those carried out by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The World Bank (2002) echoes this view, stating that such institutions play a crucial role in efficiently communicating information, defining and enforcing property rights and contracts, and fostering competition for advancing economic development (De Vanssay and Spindler 1994; Alesina 1998; De Haan and Siermann 1998; Nelson and Singh 1998). Market-based institutions promote economic freedom by providing growth-incentivizing mechanisms such as low taxes, an independent legal system, and private property protection (Murphy et al. 1991; Gwartney 2009). They encourage dynamic, organized economies by facilitating free and fair competition, thanks to effective regulations, and reducing the number of government-owned enterprises (Johansson 2001).","The development of market-oriented reforms has been widely recognized as a means of promoting economic growth (Berggren 2003).

"""In the late 1980s, the Indian economy began to undergo a transformation, and by 1991, it transitioned from a state-led development model to a neoliberal one. Trade liberalization, slow deregulation of investment, and controlled output were the key factors leading to these changes. This transition brought significant adjustments both internally and externally while ensuring greater visibility of the impact of free and competitive markets. With these changes, India experienced remarkable growth rates of national and per capita incomes.

"The Fraser Institute's definition of economic freedom consists of five main components: size of government, legal framework and property rights protection, access to stable currency, freedom to engage in international trade, and regulation of labor, business, and credit. Each of these components has many sub-components and 42 distinct measurements that carry their own weight. The Economic Freedom of the World Report uses a scale of 0-10 to rank each component and sub-component based on available data, then combines the ratings to determine a country's overall economic freedom.

"There has been a traditional belief in the economic world that freedom from coercion can lead to growth and affluence. From Adam Smith's time until now, many economists have reasoned that economic freedom, as described by Hayek, plays a crucial role in promoting growth. This belief is backed up by strong evidence that shows a positive statistical correlation between economic freedom and growth. Since competition is vital in free economies, they tend to experience faster growth than less free ones. Furthermore, competition leads to increased economic growth, particularly in liberal economies, which report a higher number of entrepreneurial discoveries and private investments. While economic freedom is an essential indicator, the effects of its individual components vary across different economies. Many studies have been carried out to determine its diverse impacts on the economy's overall health.","Economic freedom, defined as ""absence of coercion,"" has been a longstanding belief among economists since the days of Adam Smith. There is strong evidence supporting the positive correlation between economic freedom and growth, with competition being a key driver of the free market economies. As a result, it is expected that free-market economies would grow and prosper faster than those with less economic freedom. Liberal economies, in particular, are well-positioned to foster entrepreneurial discoveries and channel private investments to areas with higher returns. Although economic freedom is an essential indicator of a healthy economy, its individual components have varying effects on the economy's overall health. There have been numerous studies exploring the different impacts of economic freedom's components on the economy, such as Ayal and Karras in 1998, Heckelman and Stroup in 2000, and Berggren and Jordahl in 2006.","The concept of economic freedom has been a widely held belief among economists since the time of Adam Smith. Economic freedom, which refers to the absence of coercion, is thought to be a precursor to growth and affluence. The belief is backed by strong empirical evidence that shows a positive correlation between economic freedom and growth. As economic freedom promotes competition, it is logical to expect free-market economies to grow faster than those with less freedom. Liberal economies, in particular, provide fertile ground for entrepreneurship and private investments, thereby directing resources to the most profitable areas. While economic freedom is an important indicator of an economy's health, each of its components affects it differently. This has been demonstrated in various studies, including the ones conducted by Ayal and Karras in 1998, Heckelman and Stroup in 2000, and Berggren and Jordahl in 2006."
"It is widely agreed upon that secure property rights are essential for economic growth, as highlighted by Parente and Prescott (2000). This is because secure and transferable rights to assets and contracts generate investment, which helps in enhancing growth. The allocation of assets becomes more efficient through security of property rights, leading to further promotion of growth (World Bank 2002). By having a well-functioning legal structure to support property rights, it becomes a necessary complement institution to other components of economic freedom, as suggested by Rodrik (2000).","The importance of property rights for economic growth has been widely acknowledged, as confirmed by Parente and Prescott (2000). Secure and transferable rights to assets and contracts induce investment, which can lead to a boost in economic growth. With secure property rights, the allocation of assets becomes efficient, further contributing to growth (World Bank 2002). A well-functioning legal system that support property rights complements other aspects of economic freedom and can act as a necessary institution (Rodrik 2000).","The significance of property rights in promoting economic growth has been widely accepted, as stated by Parente and Prescott (2000). Secure and transferable ownership of assets and contracts stimulate investment, thereby fostering economic growth.

A well-functioning legal system that supports property rights is a crucial complementary institution to other components of economic freedom, according to Rodrik (2000)."
"Access to sound currency is an essential component of economic freedom as it stresses the importance of keeping inflation under control. The repercussions of high and erratic inflation can have a detrimental effect on economic growth. However, Akerlof et al. argue that a moderate level of inflation can assist in the setting of prices and wages. It provides a necessary lubricant to the economic adjustment of relative prices in times of market fluctuations. In cases of wage and price rigidity, moderate inflation adds real wage flexibility that leads to a reduction in the long run unemployment rate. Nevertheless, empirical evidence on the relationship between inflation and growth is not conclusive.","One aspect of economic freedom includes access to stable currency, which emphasizes the importance of keeping inflation in check. Experiencing high and unstable inflation can be harmful to economic growth. Nonetheless, according to Akerlof et al., a reasonable level of inflation can have a lubricating effect on price and wage settings, especially in times of significant market fluctuations. With downward nominal wage and price rigidity, inflation promotes real wage flexibility that reduces long-term unemployment rates. The relationship between inflation and growth is somewhat ambiguous based on empirical evidence.","Another crucial component of economic freedom is the availability of stable currency, which highlights the significance of controlling inflation. The negative impact of high and fluctuating inflation on economic growth is well-documented. However, moderate inflation can grease the wheels of price and wage setting process, particularly when there are rigidities in the labor market. In such situations, it allows for greater flexibility in real wages and reduces the long-term rate of unemployment. Nonetheless, the exact relationship between inflation and growth is not entirely clear and remains somewhat controversial with mixed empirical evidence."
"The freedom to trade internationally may suggest that there are efficiency gains to be had through trade liberalization. With free trade, domestic firms can benefit from increased productivity, especially if exchanges are based on comparative advantages and international competition is present. This connection to the global market can also result in the spread of technological advancements. Despite continued debate about the relationship between trade liberalization and economic growth, some studies offer evidence supporting a positive correlation (Greenaway et al., 2002), while others are more hesitant to draw conclusions (Yanikkaya, 2003). Sachs and Warner (1995), as well as Rodriguez and Rodrik (2001), remain divided on the issue.","The freedom to engage in international trade could suggest that there are benefits of efficiency resulting from trade liberalization. When trade is liberalized, interaction with the global market has the potential to diffuse technology. Domestic firms can increase their productivity if they try to achieve exchanges based on comparative advantages, with international competition in the background. Nevertheless, the connection between trade liberalization and economic growth remains unresolved, with varying views among researchers (Sachs and Warner, 1995; Rodriguez and Rodrik, 2001) and contradictory evidence from different studies. While Greenaway et al. (2002) reported positive linkage between free trade and economic growth, Yanikkaya (2003) disagreed.","The ability to trade internationally without restrictions may imply that there are gains in efficiency as a result of trade liberalization. Global market interaction facilitated by trade liberalization has the potential to result in the spread of technology.

Nevertheless, the relationship between trade liberalization and economic growth is still uncertain, with various interpretations among researchers (Sachs and Warner, 1995; Rodriguez and Rodrik, 2001), and inconsistent evidence in different studies. While some studies supported a positive relationship between free trade and economic growth (Greenaway et al., 2002), others were more doubtful (Yanikkaya, 2003)."
"Regulating labor, credit, and business is deemed an essential element of economic freedom. Scholars agree that fewer regulations commonly produce positive results in terms of growth (Calmfors and Driffill 1988; Baumol et al. 2007). The presence of unfavorable labor laws and continuous labor protest and disputes can have detrimental effects on businesses. Additionally, insufficient infrastructure and raw materials can impede control over the business. High transaction costs present trade and economic activity limitations, which are hindrances to the economic freedom of agents (Debroy et al. 2011).","The regulation of labor, credit, and business represents an integral component of economic liberty. There is widespread agreement that reducing regulatory burdens generally has a positive impact on economic growth (Calmfors and Driffill 1988; Baumol et al. 2007).

"The construction of India's economic freedom index is based on the Economic Freedom of the World Report by the Fraser Institute. This helps in ensuring that the rating for economic freedom in Indian states is comparable to those of other countries. However, given the unique conditions and responsibility-sharing between the center and states in India, only three dimensions have been deemed appropriate for the index. These dimensions allow state governments to impact conditions and institutions directly. The three dimensions are designed in such a way to measure all the vital aspects of economic freedom in respective states of the country. The economic freedom index has a rating scale from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating higher degrees of economic freedom.

"The study is concerned with the economic freedom index and not its change, even though analyzing changes may have been more useful. The data available for the freedom index in India only spanned three years, so looking at changes would reduce the data period to two and lessen the number of observations. Previous studies have also examined the level of economic freedom index rather than the change, with prior empirical evidence indicating that economic freedom can have an impact on growth, but not the other way around. As a result, the study proposes a linear multiple regression model without testing for endogeneity.","The research focuses on the level of economic freedom index rather than its change, although studying the latter may have been more advantageous.

"Greater economic freedom is associated with higher levels of economic growth due to the productivity effect. The variables in the freedom index frequently lead to price distortions, which can impact how resources are allocated and efficiency. Consequently, economic freedom is likely to have positive impacts on economic growth, as observed by Cole in 2005.","A direct correlation exists between elevated levels of economic freedom and increased rates of economic growth. This link is likely attributed to the ""productivity effect,"" which arises as a result of many freedom index variables measuring price distortion and influencing resource allocation efficiency. Therefore, economic freedom is expected to have a positive impact on economic growth, Cole (2005) suggests.","The higher the degree of economic freedom, the higher the rate of economic growth, as evidenced by research. This relationship can be explained by the ""productivity effect,"" which arises from the fact that many of the freedom index variables measure price distortions that hinder the efficiency of resource allocation. As such, economic freedom is likely to have a favorable impact on economic growth, according to Cole's (2005) findings."
"It can be proposed that the promotion of a smaller government, the strengthening of legal provisions, and the assurance of secure property rights, along with greater adaptability and state involvement in credit, labour market, and businesses, could lead to a higher rate of economic growth in India. According to the neoclassical growth models of Solow-Swan and Ramsey, a greater value given to the rule of law indicator would cause an increase in the level of output per effective worker at a steady-state level. Conversely, a higher proportion of government consumption to GDP, which results in lower levels of output per effective worker at a steady-state level, would lead to a reduction in the growth rate. In conclusion, the growth rate is propelled in the former scenario while it is slowed down in the latter (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004).","It is possible to postulate that India's economic growth could be enhanced by implementing a smaller government, improved legal measures, and guaranteed property rights, along with increased state intervention and adaptability in the credit, labour market, and business sectors. Solow-Swan and Ramsey's neoclassical growth models reveal that a higher value assigned to the rule of law indicator elevates the output per effective worker at a steady-state level, while a greater proportion of government consumption to GDP leads to a decrease in the output per effective worker at a steady-state level, causing a decline in the growth rate. Hence, growth rates are stimulated in the former scenario and lowered in the latter (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004).","To boost India's economic growth, it could be suggested that the government should minimize its size, improve legal provisions, and secure property rights while increasing flexibility and state intervention in credit, labour market, and business. According to Solow-Swan and Ramsey's neoclassical growth models, a higher value of the rule of law indicator can increase the output per effective worker at a steady-state level. On the other hand, a higher ratio of government consumption to GDP can lower the output per effective worker at a steady-state level, reducing the growth rate. As a result, a higher growth rate can be attained through the former approach, whereas the latter method can lead to a slowdown in growth for a given set of values (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 2004)."
"According to Debroy et al. (2011), when the government interferes with the economy by having a larger role in producing and providing goods and services, or redistributing resources, it reduces the level of economic freedom. The increase in government expenditure can lead to distortions in private decision-making, which can affect the government's activities and lead to adverse effects of associated public finance, as explained by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004). The role of government in a free economy, in terms of economic freedom, should only provide protective and productive functions. When government expenditures exceed these basic functions and involve transferring resources between taxpayers, it is seen as limiting economic freedom, which was pointed out by Compton et al. (2011). Therefore, a small government is essential for raising economic freedom, while a large government size reflects more resource reallocation and intrusion into the private market that may hinder freedom. The non-linear relationship between government size and economic freedom was accounted for in creating the freedom index.","When the government interferes in the economy or has a larger role as a producer, a provider, or a redistributor of resources in order to reduce the level of economic freedom, it is revealed that this can lead to distortions in private decisions, as Debroy et al. (2011) explained. The increase in the size of the government and its spending could have serious negative impacts on both governmental activities and public finances, as detailed by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004). The freedom index aims to capture the idea that the government should only provide protective and productive functions in a free economy. Any government expenditures beyond these basic functions, and the transferring of resources between taxpayers, are regarded as the curtailment of economic freedom, as emphasized by Compton et al. (2011). Ultimately, a small government size is necessary for increasing economic freedom, while a large size of government connotes more intervention in the private market, indicating a decline in freedom. In creating the freedom index, the non-linear relationship between government size and economic freedom was taken into account.","As per the studies by Debroy et al. (2011), any interference by the government in the economy or its enhanced role as a producer, provider, or redistributor of resources, can reduce the degree of economic freedom. The rise in government size and its expenses is likely to lead to disfiguring private decisions, which may ultimately affect both governmental activities and public finance, as stated by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004). The freedom index for economic freedom seeks to convey the notion that a government's role in a free economy should only consist of protective and productive functions. Therefore, any government spending beyond the basic functions and transferring of resources between taxpayers is deemed as impinging on economic freedom, as stated by Compton et al. (2011). For this reason, a small size of government is essential to raising economic freedom, whereas a large size indicates more intrusion into the private market and more resource reallocation, possibly impacting economic freedom adversely. The non-linear relationship between government size and economic freedom is appropriately considered in constructing the freedom index."
"Undertaking any business venture's success hinges heavily on the flexibility of labor markets. An entrepreneur's capacity to adopt necessary adjustments to expand their enterprise is greatly beneficial (Altman, 2007). Similarly, entrepreneurs profit significantly from the freedom to optimize their workforce and exit markets. However, infrastructural and raw material constraints can be a detriment to entrepreneurs and may lead to their failure (Debroy et al., 2011).","The adaptability of labor markets is a crucial factor that contributes to the success of any business venture. Entrepreneurs' ability to steer their organizations towards necessary change to grow is fundamental (Altman, 2007). Permitting entrepreneurs to optimize their workforce and leave markets are strategic advantages. On the other hand, entrepreneurs may face limitations regarding infrastructure and raw materials that can hinder their growth and lead to their failure (Debroy et al., 2011).","Ensuring a flexible labor market is vital for the successful operation of any business. It is a significant indication of an entrepreneur's ability to embrace necessary changes that foster enterprise growth (Altman, 2007). Granting entrepreneurs the freedom to optimize their labor base and exit markets can enhance their business capabilities significantly. However, entrepreneurs' success may depend on the availability of infrastructure and raw materials, and constraints in these areas could hinder the growth of their enterprise, leading to failure (Debroy et al., 2011)."
"The money market's volatility can lead to uncertainties, and these uncertainties are often indicated by inflation which can also reflect macroeconomic instability. Various views on the impact of inflation on output growth have contradictory claims. Inflation can lead to either the ""grease effect"" (Tobin 1972) or the ""sand effect"" (Friedman 1977). The grease effect suggests that inflation can help adjust to long-run equilibrium faster, while the sand effect speculates the possibility of misallocation of resources that can cause a deceleration in growth. Studies reveal that developed countries tend to exhibit a predominant grease effect, while developing countries show a significant sand effect. One debate is that high inflation rates can cause inefficient allocation of resources, distorting price signals and leading to a decrease in real net return on investment. Consequently, there will be a decline in investment and economic growth in the long run. Conversely, some believe that inflation may have favorable impacts as money can act as a capital substitute. Despite conflicting views, the empirical impact of inflation on economic growth remains uncertain.","The instability in the money market can create uncertainties, which are often characterized by inflation, indicating macroeconomic instability as well. The role of inflation in output growth has conflicting opinions, with the ""grease effect"" (Tobin 1972) and the ""sand effect"" (Friedman 1977) producing opposing effects. While the grease effect suggests that inflation helps the adjustment to long-run equilibrium, the sand effect raises concerns about possible resource misallocation, slowing down growth. As per empirical literature on developed countries, the grease effect takes precedence, whereas the sand effect gains significance in developing countries (Loboguerrero and Panizza 2003). The high inflation rates cause inefficiencies in resource allocation, resulting in a decrease of real net returns on investment and thereby lead to a decline in investment and economic growth in the long run. However, some argue that money can serve as a substitute for capital, making inflation to have favorable effects as well (Tobin 1980). Consequently, the impact of inflation on economic growth remains an empirical question.","Volatility in the money market may lead to uncertainties, and one of the indicators of such volatility is inflation, which also reflects macroeconomic instability. There are clashing views on the role of inflation in output growth as inflation can have both positive and negative effects. The ""grease effect"" (Tobin 1972) suggests that inflation can speed up the adjustment to long-run equilibrium, while the ""sand effect"" (Friedman 1977) speculates on the potential for resource misallocation resulting in deceleration in growth. In developed countries, the grease effect seems to play a more significant role in spurring growth, while in developing countries, the sand effect becomes more significant (Loboguerrero and Panizza 2003). High inflation rates can distort price signals and relative prices due to inefficient allocation of resources (Akerlof et al. 1996), leading to a decrease in the real net return on investment. As a result, investment and economic growth are likely to decline in the long run. On the other hand, money can act as a substitute for capital, leading to the possible favorable impact of inflation on economic growth (Tobin 1980). The impact of inflation on economic growth remains an empirical question with no clear consensus."
"The composition of an economy's sectors is a significant factor in its growth trend. The industry mix, which is reflected in the sectoral composition, provides insights into this aspect. Favorable structural changes that lean towards fast-growing sectors boost growth and the income earned per capita. Although previous studies looked into the role of services in compositional effects, the Indian economy emphasizes the manufacturing industry as much as the fast-rising service sector, which is an employment-generating sector. Understanding compositional effects relies on two independent factors: the shares of employment for the secondary and tertiary sectors. However, the influence of such factors is unclear, and their expected signs depend on each sector's relative size and the dynamics of employment across all the economy's sectors. Therefore, the impact of industry and services shares on India's growth rates remains an empirical inquiry.","The structure of an economy plays an important role in its economic growth. The sectoral composition, which reflects the industry mix, can be used as a useful indicator in this regard. A shift towards fast-growing sectors can bring about improvements in growth and per capita income. Earlier studies have examined the role of services in compositional effects, but in the Indian economy, the manufacturing sector, as well as the fast-growing service sector, are both crucial employment-generating sectors. To understand the compositional effects, the shares of employment for the secondary and tertiary sectors are analyzed as two independent factors. However, the expected sign of each variable is not clear and depends on the relative size of each sector and the employment dynamics prevailing in all other sectors. Therefore, the impact of the shares of industry and services on growth in India remains an empirical question.","Understanding an economy's structure is crucial in relation to its economic growth. An indication of the industry mix, the sectoral composition is useful for this purpose. Changes in favor of fast-growing sectors can lead to growth and per capita income improvements. Prior studies focused on services to analyze such compositional effects, but in the Indian economy, manufacturing is also critical as an employment-generating sector alongside the fast-growing service sector. To comprehend the compositional effects, the shares of employment for the secondary and tertiary sectors are considered two independent variables. However, the expected sign of each variable is not clear and depends on both the relative size of individual sectors and employment dynamics across all sectors. Therefore, the possible impact of shares of industry and services on the country's growth rate remains an empirical question."
"Investing in human capital is essential for economic growth. The level of human capital is a crucial factor in determining a country's growth rates. Researchers suggest that increasing investment in human capital can lead to higher growth rates until the economy reaches a steady state. Human capital can help alleviate the issues associated with diminishing returns to physical capital, and as a result, yield long-term per capita growth. Thus, the production of human capital can be an alternative mechanism to generate growth instead of relying on technological progress. The availability of human capital can also help reduce the costs associated with adopting sophisticated techniques and technologies in a country, which can lead to higher returns. In addition, the balance between human and physical capital affects the growth rate, with an abundance of human relative to physical capital leading to faster growth rates. Conversely, if human capital is relatively scarce, growth rates will fall. Overall, investing in human capital is a crucial factor in promoting economic growth.","One of the significant contributing factors to economic growth is the level of human capital. Increasing investment in human capital leads to higher growth rates until the economy reaches a steady state. Human capital's presence can relax the limiting constraints associated with diminishing returns to physical capital resulting in long-term per capita growth in the absence of exogenous technological progress. This means that the creation of human capital can substitute for technological progress, consequently generating long-term growth. Depending on the balance of human and physical capital, the growth rates can either increase or decrease. For instance, an economy with abundant human capital relative to physical capital tends to have higher growth rates, while a scarcity of human capital relative to physical capital leads to slower growth rates. In situations where physical capital or human capital destruction occurs, the economy can recover much faster if physical, rather than human capital is destroyed. In addition, a country with more human capital availability can adopt sophisticated techniques and technologies at a lower cost and achieve higher returns.","The amount of human capital invested in a country is a significant determinant of economic growth. Studies have shown that an increase in human capital investment leads to higher growth rates until the economy approaches a steady state. The presence of human capital can reduce the constraints associated with diminishing returns to physical capital, leading to long-term per capita growth rates without the need for technological progress. This means that investing in human capital can serve as an alternative to improving technology to stimulate growth. The balance between human and physical capital also plays a critical role in shaping growth rates. A country with abundant human capital relative to physical capital will tend to have higher growth rates, while a country with more physical capital than human capital will experience slower growth rates. In crises, the destruction of physical capital causes less severe economic harm than the destruction of human capital, and therefore, it is easier for the economy to recover from the destruction of physical capital. With greater availability of human capital, the cost of adopting new techniques and technologies is reduced, leading to higher returns."
"The implementation of various liberalization measures in India dates back to 1991, consisting of two phases: the first and the second generation reforms. The academic circles use these terms to differentiate between the external and internal liberalization initiatives. The first generation reforms concentrated on the external sector, introduced by the central government, concerning product markets. On the other hand, the second generation reforms aimed at the domestic economy and emphasized issues that primarily fall under the purview of the state government, especially the markets for land and labor. These pertinent policies are discussed in works by Debroy et al. (2011) and Jha (2009).","India introduced a series of liberalization measures, primarily external and internal, commencing in 1991. Scholars refer to these measures as first and second generation reforms, categorized by the focus of the reforms. First-generation reforms were initiated by the central government, with specific emphasis on the external sector and product markets. The latter came under the purview of the central government. Second-generation reforms that took place later mainly focused on domestic economic reforms, with particular attention to issues that come under the jurisdiction of state governments, such as markets for land and labor. Debroy et al. (2011) and Jha (2009) are two prominent sources of information on this topic.","From 1991, India has implemented various internal and external liberalization measures that were later divided into two types of reforms - the first and second generation reforms. The first wave of reforms was directed towards the external sector and product markets, which came under the scrutiny of the central government. On the other hand, the second-generation reforms aimed to prioritize domestic economic reforms and address issues coming under the state government's purview, especially for the markets of land and labor. Prominent scholars who have discussed these reforms include Jha (2009) and Debroy et al. (2011)."
"Notably, there have been significant enhancements in the economic freedom scores due to the implemented reforms with the values rising from 5.1 in 1990 to 6.4 in 2008 (Table 1). The individual indicators of economic freedom, except for 'access to sound money,' have persistently shown improvements over the years. The individual indices measure how much freedom from government-imposed restrictions on various significant aspects is available (Debroy et al. 2011). These developments are fascinating to take note of.","The reforms have contributed significantly to the rise in economic freedom scores, with values increasing from 5.1 in 1990 to 6.4 in 2008 (Table 1). Moreover, all individual indicators of economic freedom, except for access to sound money, have consistently shown improvements. The individual indices measure how much freedom from government-imposed restrictions on different relevant aspects is accessible (Debroy et al. 2011). It is worth noting these developments.","Through the course of time, it is interesting to observe that the reforms have led to substantial advancements in economic freedom scores with values increasing from 5.1 in 1990 to 6.4 in 2008 (Table 1). In addition, all the individual indicators of economic freedom, except access to sound money, have persistently shown improvements. These indices determine the degree of freedom from limitations imposed by the government on a wide range of significant aspects (Debroy et al. 2011). These developments are intriguing to note."
"India is a vast country with significant variations among its states, potentially attributed to their different social, political, and institutional structures. As a result, the national situation may not accurately represent the states' situations. Furthermore, economic reform plans have not had an equal impact on all of the country's states. While some states have been more enthusiastic about adopting reform initiatives, others have remained trepidatious. As a result, some states have a greater degree of economic freedom, and some have seen more significant growth than others. As a result, the examination of economic freedom and growth patterns should concentrate on these inter-state differences.","India, being an enormous country, displays clear discrepancies among its component states, probably due to variations in their socio-political and institutional setups. Consequently, the national scenario may not accurately depict the conditions of the respective states. Additionally, the impact of economic reforms has not been uniform across all regions of the country. While some states have shown more willingness to embrace the reform agendas, others have lagged behind consistently. As a result, certain states enjoy greater economic freedom than others, and some have experienced more rapid growth rates. Hence, assessing economic freedom and growth patterns necessitates examining these inter-state variations.","India, being a vast nation, consists of distinctly diverse states with possible distinctions arising due to socio-political and institutional variations. Thus, the national scenario may not accurately portray the conditions of the states individually. Furthermore, the economic reform policies are not uniformly implemented across all regions of the country. Some states have exhibited greater enthusiasm in welcoming the reform initiatives, while others have been cautious. Consequently, some states possess a more broad-based approach to economic freedom, and some have witnessed better growth rates than others. Consequently, the study of economic growth and freedom necessitates an examination of the inter-state differences."
The study is concerned with economic freedom and its indices as significant variables to be investigated. The first column of Table 2 demonstrates the outcomes concerning the influence of overall economic freedom on economic growth. A positive and meaningful coefficient of the overall economic freedom index portrays that economic growth tends to increase in states that have higher levels of economic freedom.,"This research analysis examines the importance of economic freedom and economic freedom indices as key variables. The findings presented in column 1 of Table 2 reveal the relationship between overall economic freedom and economic growth. Interestingly, the overall economic freedom index has a positive and statistically significant coefficient, indicating that states with higher levels of economic freedom tend to have higher economic growth.","The main focus of this study is on economic freedom and economic freedom measures as crucial variables. The outcomes related to the effects of overall economic freedom on economic growth are demonstrated in the first column of Table 2. The overall economic freedom index has a positive and significant coefficient, suggesting that states with more economic freedom tend to achieve greater economic growth."
"According to the data presented in Table 2, columns 2, 3, and 4 illustrate the economic freedom indices for three different components. With regards to the economic freedom index for the size of government, it appears that a lower level of government intervention leads to higher levels of economic freedom and subsequently greater economic growth. The coefficient for this index is significant and positive, indicating that states with smaller government spending, a smaller government enterprise sector, and lower marginal tax rates tend to achieve greater economic growth. Additionally, the coefficients for legal structure and security of property rights are both positive and significant, suggesting that ensuring the rule of law and protecting property rights are vital aspects of governance that positively influence economic growth. The regulation of labor and business also plays a critical role in economic growth, with this area of economic freedom reflecting the impact of state intervention in labor markets, bureaucratic and procedural costs, as well as physical infrastructure. Therefore, it can be said that high flexibility in labor markets contributes to increased output growth. Testing all three economic freedom indices simultaneously in the model (Table 2, column 5) shows that the results consistently support the preceding data.","Table 2 shows the economic freedom indices for three different components, displayed in columns 2, 3, and 4. The economic freedom index for the size of government suggests that high levels of economic freedom, brought about by reduced government intervention, lead to greater economic growth. The coefficient for this index is positive and significant, which implies that states with smaller government spending, less government enterprise sector, and lower marginal tax rates tend to achieve higher economic growth. Additionally, the coefficient for legal structure and security of property rights is positive, pointing to the importance of ensuring law and order and protecting property to achieve good governance, thereby promoting economic growth. The regulation of labor and business plays a direct role in economic growth, revealing state intervention in labor markets, bureaucratic and procedural costs, and physical infrastructure. Furthermore, high flexibility in the labor market leads to increased output growth. The model's robustness was additionally checked by simultaneously testing all three economic freedom indices (as seen in Table 2, column 5), with the results being consistent.","The data presented in Table 2 depicts the economic freedom indices for three distinct components in columns 2, 3, and 4.

A high level of flexibility in the labor market contributes to increasing output growth. Finally, a simultaneous test of all three economic freedom indices, as shown in Table 2, column 5, reinforces the consistency and robustness of the results."
"The share of employment in India's tertiary sector has a direct impact on the country's per capita income growth. However, the secondary sector's share of employment does not seem to have any significant relevance. The objective of incorporating the tertiary and secondary sectors in the growth model is to analyze the net compositional effects resulting from the shift of people from low-productive agriculture jobs to higher productive opportunities emerging from the secondary and tertiary sectors. India's growth story is currently attributing a large part of its success to the expanding tertiary sector, which is observing a continuous rise in its share in the country's GDP. The surge in the tertiary sector's growth and employment is largely driven by information and communication technology, revealing that the dominant contribution of ICT in promoting India's growth.","The proportion of employment in India's tertiary sector plays a vital role in determining the country's per capita income growth. Conversely, the contribution of the secondary sector's share of employment does not seem to be significant. The intention behind including both sectors in the growth model is to examine the overall effects on the economy resulting from the shift of individuals from the unproductive agricultural sector to the higher productive secondary and tertiary sectors. Presently, the story of India's growth is largely attributed to the expansion of the tertiary sector, which has seen a steady rise in its share of the country's GDP. This growth is primarily being led by the information and communication technology (ICT) industry, showcasing the crucial role of ICT in promoting India's economic growth.","The proportion of employment in India's tertiary sector has a direct correlation with the country's per capita income growth.

The rationale behind including both sectors in the growth model is to analyze the overall compositional effects resulting from people transitioning from low-productive agriculture to high-productive secondary and tertiary sectors. Presently, the growth narrative of India is largely due to the expansion of the tertiary sector, which is evident from its rising share in the country's GDP. The growth and employment increase in the tertiary sector are primarily driven by the information and communication technology (ICT) industry, underscoring the crucial role of ICT in promoting India's economic growth."
"The importance of measuring literacy rates as an indication of human capital is noteworthy when it comes to the role it plays in influencing economic growth. The positive correlation between initial literacy rate coefficients and economic growth suggests that states with stronger human capital foundations at the outset tend to have higher growth levels. This indicates that the existence of human capital faculties can complement physical capital, allowing for a delay in the onset of diminishing returns to reproducible capital, as identified by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991).","When it comes to determining economic growth, the literacy rate, which serves as a proxy for human capital, plays a crucial role. The positive value of the initial literacy rate coefficient indicates that states with higher human capital levels at the beginning tend to experience more substantial growth. As such, human capital can complement physical capital, thereby delaying the onset of diminishing returns to reproducible capital, according to Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991). This suggests that human capital, together with physical capital, can contribute to sustainable economic growth.","The literacy rate, often used as an indicator of human capital, is a vital determinant of economic growth. From the positive coefficient of the initial literacy rate, it is evident that the states with greater human capital resources tend to experience higher growth rates. This implies that human capital can act as a complement to physical capital and prevent the onset of diminishing returns to reproducible capital, as Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991) noted. Hence, human capital is capable of contributing to long-term economic growth along with physical capital."
"The per capita income growth rate of the Indian states is linked to their initial levels of per capita income. Interestingly, states that have high per capita incomes initially grow faster than their counterparts with low per capita incomes, supporting the findings of Rao et al. (1999). This discovery opposes the prediction of the neoclassical growth theory, which assumes that there are diminishing returns to reproducible capital, as explained by Solow in 1956. Instead, the outcomes imply that there is an increase in returns to the reproducible capital and a gap in economic growth across the Indian states (Rao et al. 1999).","The initial levels of per capita income in the Indian states have a positive correlation with their per capita income growth rate. It's noteworthy that states with higher initial per capita incomes tend to have a higher growth rate compared to their counterparts with lower per capita incomes, which supports the findings of Rao et al. (1999). This finding goes against the neoclassical growth theory's prediction of diminishing returns to reproducible capital, as proposed by Solow in 1956.

"It is evident from the results that economic freedom has a positive impact on the economic growth of India. What is noteworthy is that all three dimensions of economic freedom play a significant role in the Indian states. Therefore, it is sensible for the nation and its constituent states to reduce the size of the government and minimize the government's involvement in the market's free operation. The need for flexible regulations in credit, labor, and product markets is also indispensable. Strengthening the legal structure would enhance the business-friendly environment throughout the Indian states, thus leading to economic growth.","The data demonstrates that economic freedom promotes economic growth in India. What is striking is that all aspects of economic freedom are significant to the Indian states. As such, it is judicious for the country and its regions to downsize the government and limit its meddling in the market's free mechanism. Additionally, flexible regulations concerning credit, labor, and product markets are equally crucial. Strengthening the legal framework would establish a more hospitable environment for businesses across India's states, encouraging growth.","The findings indicate that economic freedom plays a key role in driving economic growth in India. It is noteworthy that all three dimensions of economic freedom are equally important for the Indian states. Therefore, it is advisable for the country and its constituent parts to limit the size of the government and its intervention in the market's unobstructed functioning. Also, having flexible regulations governing the credit, labor, and product markets are indispensable. Strengthening the legal structure would create a more conducive business environment across India's states, leading to economic progress."
"Economic growth can be affected by both economic freedom and culture, as described in this paper. Culture, as measured by the World Values Surveys, and economic institutions related to economic freedom are both vital for economic prosperity, though their impact can only be fully understood when both are considered in the growth regression. Results from the research indicate that economic freedom has a more substantial influence on growth outcomes than culture, implying a certain level of substitutability between these two factors. In the absence of economic freedom, culture plays a more significant role in growth, while its significance decreases as economic freedom is established.","This paper explores the influence of economic culture and freedom on economic growth. According to the World Values Surveys measuring culture and economic institutions grounded on economic freedom, both factors independently impact economic prosperity. However, only when both are included in the growth regression can their strength of impact be better understood. Research results show that economic freedom is more critical than culture for growth outcomes, indicating a certain degree of substitution between the two. The study argues that culture is essential for growth when economic freedom is absent, reducing in relevance when economic freedom is established.","The relationship between economic freedom, culture, and economic prosperity is discussed in this paper. The study suggests that economic freedom and culture, as measured by the World Values Surveys, are both crucial factors affecting economic growth.

The results indicate that economic freedom has a more substantial impact on growth outcomes than culture, implying that culture and economic freedom can complement or substitute each other. Furthermore, the research suggests that culture's importance diminishes as economic freedom is established, whereas culture plays a more significant role in growth in the absence of economic freedom."
"In order to facilitate economic growth and development, it is essential to establish fundamental economic institutions, such as private property, rule of law, and contract enforcement. According to North's (1990) definition, institutions refer to the ""rules of the game,"" including formal structures and informal norms, that incentivize behaviors. Formal institutions are written rules, while informal institutions are the cultures, norms, and conventions outlined by social custom. Although economists acknowledge the significance of both formal and informal institutions on growth and development, it is still unknown which has greater impact. As a result, we contend that economic institutions and culture must both be taken into account when examining economic growth.","To stimulate economic growth and development, it is crucial to institute economic institutions, such as private property, the rule of law, and contract enforcement. North (1990) defined institutions as the ""rules of the game,"" both formal and informal, which regulate actions through incentives. Formal institutions are structured regulations or written rules, while informal institutions are encompassed by cultures, norms, and conventions imposed by social customs. Economists acknowledge the linkage between both formal and informal institutions and growth and development, although it is still unknown which has a greater impact. Therefore, we propose that examining economic growth demands attention to both economic institutions and culture.","Establishing economic institutions like private property, rule of law, and contract enforcement is paramount for economic growth and development. North (1990) defined institutions as the ""rules of the game,"" which include both formal and informal regulations that govern behavior through incentives.

Though economists recognize the importance of both formal and informal institutions to growth and development, their relative effects remain uncertain. Therefore, we argue that both economic institutions and culture must be considered while studying economic growth."
"The primary aim of this study is to include 'cultural capital' into the freedom-growth framework and provide a contribution to the literature on the significance of institutions for economic development. The analysis disentangles the impact of economic institutions and cultures, determining empirically the significances of their effects on economic outcomes. This research aims to understand whether economic freedom and culture complement or substitute each other, and the main focus is on assessing their relative effects. The investigation does not emphasize the interaction or feedback between culture and freedom; instead, it examines how economic freedom and culture influence economic prosperity.","The central objective of this study is to incorporate 'cultural capital' into the freedom-growth framework and provide insights into the literature regarding the role of institutions in economic development.

"The study employed a fixed effects model from 1970 to 2004 and conducted multiple robustness checks. The findings indicate that economic prosperity is influenced by both culture and economic freedom. However, when culture and economic freedom are taken into account simultaneously, the association between culture and economic growth becomes less strong, while the impact of economic freedom on growth is overwhelmingly positive and highly significant. This implies that culture and economic freedom can operate as substitutes, with culture fulfilling core institutional functions like protecting property rights and enforcing contracts when economic freedom is absent. However, economic freedom institutions become credible, reducing the need for informal culture mechanisms.","The research utilized a fixed effects model spanning from 1970 to 2004 while incorporating numerous robustness checks. The study discovered that economic prosperity is impacted by both culture and economic freedom. Nevertheless, when analyzing both culture and economic freedom together, the relationship between culture and economic growth weakens, whereas the influence of economic freedom on growth remains positive and extremely significant. Thus, culture and economic freedom may function as replacements, in which culture offers essential institutional functions such as defending property rights and enforcing agreements in the absence of economic freedom. However, when economic freedom institutions are trustworthy, the informal mechanisms of culture become less necessary.","The study employed a fixed effects model covering the period from 1970 to 2004 and incorporated multiple robustness checks. The results revealed that both culture and economic freedom independently contribute to economic prosperity. Nevertheless, when both culture and economic freedom are taken into account simultaneously, the association between culture and economic growth weakens, while economic freedom continues to have a strong and statistically significant positive relationship with economic growth. This indicates that culture and economic freedom may serve as substitutes, where culture provides crucial institutional functions like safeguarding property rights and enforcing contracts in the absence of economic freedom. However, when credible economic freedom institutions are in place, there is less need for relying on the informal mechanisms of culture."
"The connection between economic freedom and growth is thoroughly examined in the literature, as mentioned above. The theoretical basis for this correlation is also well-established. According to De Haan and Sturm (2000: 3), the freedom to choose and supply resources, competition in business, trade with others, and secure property rights are essential ingredients for economic progress, and economists and economic historians have been promoting these factors since the time of Adam Smith, if not sooner.","As previously mentioned, previous literature has extensively examined the direct correlation between economic freedom and growth. The theoretical underpinnings supporting this relationship are also firmly established. De Haan and Sturm (2000: 3) assert that since the era of Adam Smith, if not before, economists and economic historians have been advocating for the importance of the freedom to choose and supply resources, competition in business, trade with others, and secure property rights as crucial aspects of economic development.","The literature has thoroughly scrutinized the robust relationship between economic freedom and growth, as mentioned earlier. The theoretical foundation for this connection is also well-established.

"To gain a greater insight into the potential impact of culture on economic development, we concentrate our attention on specific cultural concepts that are deemed pertinent to economic interaction and exchange. These cultural factors are known as 'economic culture' and are described by Porter (2000: 14) as ""the beliefs, attitudes, and values that have a bearing upon the economic activities of individuals, groups, and institutions."" By limiting our focus to these cultural indicators, we can provide a more detailed analysis of the link between culture and economic growth (Patterson 2000).","In order to delve deeper into the relationship between culture and economic progress, we narrow our scope by focusing on specific cultural indicators that are relevant to economic interactions and exchanges. This subset is referred to as 'economic culture' and is defined by Porter (2000: 14) as ""the beliefs, attitudes, and values that pertain to the economic activities of individuals, organizations, and other institutions."" By employing this more targeted approach, we can provide a more comprehensive analysis of the ways in which culture affects economic growth (Patterson 2000).","To better comprehend the potential influence of culture on economic advancement, we narrow our focus to several key cultural indicators that are germane to economic interaction and exchange.

By zooming in on these cultural factors, we can provide a more extensive examination of the link between culture and economic growth (Patterson 2000)."
"The variable associated with our economic culture is formulated based on the methodology introduced in Tabellini's works (2008a, 2009). The methodology identifies four distinct categories of culture, which are expected to influence behavior relating to social and economic interaction. The four components, namely trust, respect, individual self-expression, and obedience regulate the way people interact in markets and entrepreneurship. Trust, respect, and individual self-expression are expected to stimulate economic and social interaction, whereas obedience is considered a constraint on economic interaction that leads to lower levels of risk-taking, which is necessary for entrepreneurship.","Our assessment of economic culture is constructed using Tabellini's methodology (2008a, 2009) and involves identifying four separate categories of culture that are believed to influence individuals' behavior and impact economic growth and development. These categories, namely trust, respect, individual autonomy, and obedience, regulate the interactions between individuals involved in market production, entrepreneurship, and overall social and economic interactions. Trust, respect, and individual autonomy encourage economic and social interaction, while obedience is thought to limit economic interaction, as lower risk-taking inhibits entrepreneurship development.","Our economic culture variable is developed using the methodology outlined in Tabellini's publications (2008a, 2009) and is based on four culture-based components that shape behavior related to social and economic interactions, thus affecting economic growth and development. These four components, trust, respect, individual self-determination, and obedience, form the rules that govern interactions between individuals, including market production and entrepreneurship. Generally, trust, respect, and individual self-determination encourage social and economic activity, while obedience constrains it by limiting risk-taking, a necessary ingredient of entrepreneurship."
"Self-determination is a measure of the level of control an individual has over their lives and personal choices. If a person has a high level of self-determination, they see economic success or failure as a result of their own efforts. This motivates them to work harder to achieve greater productivity and increase their overall welfare. Banfield (1958) suggests that the more control an individual has over their lives, the higher the economic development of their country will be.","Self-determination is a quantitative measure of how much control an individual feels they have over their individual choices and their lives. When individuals attribute economic success or failure to their own efforts, they are deemed to have high levels of self-determination. With a high level of self-determination, individuals are more likely to work harder to increase their productivity and subsequently, their welfare. Banfield (1958) argues that the economic development of a country is closely associated with the level of control individuals have over their lives, as determined by their 'locus of control'.","The extent of control an individual feels they have over their lives and choices is measured by self-determination. Individuals with high levels of self-determination attribute economic success or failure to their own efforts, which motivates them to work harder and ultimately leads to an increase in their welfare. Banfield (1958) advocates that an individual's 'locus of control' plays a crucial role in the overall economic development of a country. The greater control individuals have over their lives, the greater the likelihood of economic success."
"Culture and economic freedom could be substitutes or complements, theoretically speaking. The reason for this is that both of them have an impact on economic growth independently. If both are included in the same regression and one overshadows the other, then they are considered substitutes. On the other hand, if both remain significant, it suggests that culture and economic freedom complement each other in contributing to economic growth.","The interrelation between culture and economic freedom can work in favor of substitutes or complements. This is because both of them have individual influences on economic growth. When both are considered in a single regression analysis, if one outperforms the other, then they are regarded as substitutes. Conversely, if both continue to have a significant impact, it implies that culture and economic freedom complement each other in strengthening economic growth.","The link between economic freedom and culture can either substitute or complement each other, depending on the scenario. Economic growth is affected by both economic freedom and culture separately. When both are analyzed together in the same regression, if one of them dominates the other, then they can be seen as substitutes. However, if both continue to have a significant influence, it suggests that economic freedom and culture work complementary to promote economic growth."
"An example of a culture that favors economic growth could opt to transform informal institutions into those linked with economic freedom. When the formal guidelines become credible, informal mechanisms such as trust networks, which were once relied upon for economic exchange, might lose their significance. As a result, economic freedom should take precedence over culture in the growth regression, indicating a substitution effect.","In order to foster economic growth, a culture may make a decision to formalize informal institutions and align them with economic freedom. When formal rules become reliable, the importance of informal norms and mechanisms, like trust networks used for economic interactions and exchanges, may decline significantly. If this occurs, the growth regression should show economic freedom surpassing culture and indicating a substitution effect.","To encourage economic growth, a culture may decide to formalize its informal institutions and associate them with economic freedom. As soon as these formal regulations become credible, the role of informal norms and systems, such as trust networks, that are used for economic interaction and exchange, may lose their significance. In this case, economic freedom becomes more dominant than culture in the growth regression, and a substitution effect can be observed."
"It is reasonable to believe that culture and economic freedom are complementary variables that can significantly contribute to economic growth. Although culture and economic freedom can separately catalyze the growth of an economy, the positive effects of both these variables combined are much stronger than individually. A trustworthy culture can instigate certain exchanges, but the presence of formal and informal institutions of freedom, that protect private property rights and prevent predation by government, is crucial in the sustained and large-scale economic growth. A number of studies have indicated that culture and economic freedom reinforce each other, further validating this notion. (citations excluded)","There's a compelling argument to suggest that culture and economic freedom are two interdependent variables that significantly impact economic growth. While both culture and economic freedom can independently contribute to economic growth, the combined effect of formal and informal institutions of freedom and a trustworthy culture is far stronger and sustainable. For instance, while a trusting culture can initiate certain exchanges, the support of laws that protect private property rights and prevent predatory behavior by the government is key to long-term economic growth. This argument is supported by a number of studies that have demonstrated that culture and economic freedom strengthen and reinforce each other. (references omitted)","It's reasonable to argue that culture and economic freedom are complementary to each other and both are significant variables when it comes to economic growth. Though each variable might independently contribute to economic growth, their collective impact is much stronger than individually. A culture based on trust can prompt a few exchanges, however, when paired with a government that enforces laws that protect private property rights and prevent predatory behavior, the result is sustained and large-scale economic growth. Studies suggest that culture and economic freedom enhance each other and their combined impact is important to consider. (references excluded)"
"In order to measure economic freedom, we make use of the Economic Freedom of the World Index which has been established and widely cited. The index, created by the Fraser Institute (Gwartney et al. 2008), assesses the level of economic freedom on a scale of zero to ten taking into account 42 different components. The higher the rating, the greater the level of freedom. These components are further classified into five broad groups which include the size of government, legal structure and security of private ownership, monetary policy and price stability, regulation of credit, labor, and business, and freedom to trade with foreigners. Each of the groups include a range of variables that are utilized to construct the comprehensive index of economic freedom.","To gauge economic freedom, we apply the Economic Freedom of the World Index which is widely recognized and compiled by the Fraser Institute (Gwartney et al. 2008).

The components are classified into broad categories which are the size of government, legal structure and security of private ownership, monetary policy and price stability, regulation of credit, labor and business, and freedom to trade with foreigners. Each of the categories encompasses a distinct set of variables used to develop the comprehensive index of economic freedom.","We utilize the Economic Freedom of the World Index, a reputable and extensively cited measurement tool, to assess economic freedom.

The assessment considers 42 different components classified into five major categories - the size of government, legal structure, security of private ownership, monetary policy and price stability, regulation of credit, labor and business, and freedom to trade with foreigners. Each category comprises a range of variables used to construct a comprehensive economic freedom index."
"The investment share is one of our standard control variables because studies show a positive association between the rate of investment in physical capital and growth (Levine and Renelt 1992). However, economic freedom and investment rate inclusion in the same regression may raise potential endogeneity issues, as highlighted by De Haan et al. (2006). Research suggests that economic freedom directly enhances productivity and has an indirect impact on growth via investment (Dawson 1998; Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles 2003; Gwartney et al. 2004). Despite using investment in our primary specification, we plan to deal with the endogeneity concern in later sections.","Our standard control variables include the investment share, as the literature consistently shows a positive correlation between physical capital investment and growth (Levine and Renelt 1992). Nonetheless, we recognize the potential for endogeneity problems when economic freedom and the investment rate are both included in the same regression, as identified by De Haan et al. (2006). Multiple studies have established that economic freedom has both a direct effect on productivity and an indirect effect through investment on growth (Dawson 1998; Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles 2003; Gwartney et al. 2004). Although we include investment in our primary specification, we aim to address the endogeneity concern in later sections.","To account for the well-documented positive relationship between physical capital investment and growth (Levine and Renelt 1992), we consider the investment share as a standard control variable. However, we are mindful of the potential endogeneity issue when both economic freedom and investment rate are included in the same regression, as noted by De Haan et al. (2006). Economic freedom enhances growth through direct productivity improvement and indirect promotion of investment (Dawson 1998; Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles 2003; Gwartney et al. 2004). Although investment is included in our primary specification, we intend to address the endogeneity concern in later sections."
"When examining the relationship between culture and economic freedom, column three of the regressions is used to differentiate between the substitutability and complementarity of these variables. In the OLS regression, the significance of culture is not maintained when controlling for economic freedom. Nevertheless, culture remains significant at the 10% level in the fixed effects regression analysis. Economic freedom maintains its highly positive and significant relationship with growth across both specifications. Specifically, the fixed effects model in column three shows that a one standard deviation increase in culture and freedom leads to a growth increase of 0.65 percentage points and 1.93 percentage points, respectively. The joint significance of the F-statistics from columns one to three are highest when controlling for both culture and freedom, which suggests that controlling for both variables explains more of the variation in growth. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that economic freedom is the primary contributor to economic performance, whereas culture has a more modest impact on growth.","The third column of the regressions is used to explore the relationship between culture and economic freedom by differentiating between the substitutability and complementarity of the two variables. The OLS regression indicates that culture loses its significance when controlling for economic freedom. Nonetheless, culture is found to be significant at the 10% level in the fixed effects regression analysis. Economic freedom has a strongly positive and significant impact on growth in both formulations. In the fixed effects model of column three, increasing culture and freedom by one standard deviation results in growth increases of 0.65 percentage points and 1.93 percentage points, respectively. Additionally, the joint significance of the F-statistics from all three columns is highest when controlling for both culture and freedom, indicating that we can explain more of the growth variability by incorporating both variables. These results lend support to the notion that economic freedom has a more substantial effect on economic performance than culture, although culture still has a positive impact on growth.","To differentiate between the substitutability and complementarity of culture and economic freedom in relation to growth, column three of the regressions was utilized. Results demonstrate that cultural significance disappears in the OLS regression when economic freedom is controlled.

In both specifications, economic freedom maintained its highly positive and significant relationship with growth. Specifically, in the fixed effects model presented in column three of the regressions, a one standard deviation increase in culture and freedom results in growth increases of 0.65 percentage points and 1.93 percentage points, respectively. Moreover, when controlling for both culture and freedom, the joint significance of the F-statistics in all three columns was highest, indicating that more of the variation in growth can be attributed to these variables. These results support the idea that economic freedom is primary in contributing to economic performance, although culture also has a positive, albeit milder, effect on growth."
"The results reveal that culture does not have a significant impact in all five regression specifications, but economic freedom exerts a positive and significant influence at a 99% level, providing additional evidence for the substitution theory. The findings suggest that a one-unit increase in the freedom index leads to a growth increase of 1.40 percentage points as indicated by regression (1). Remarkably, when controlling for educational attainment, the coefficient on freedom almost doubles and the R-squareds rise from an average of 0.28 to 0.93, suggesting a severe problem with endogeneity. Education is found to have a robust and significant positive association with growth, while other variables, excluding culture, are also statistically significant in this specification. Nevertheless, investment, population growth, and area show significance only in this specific regression. In contrast, urban population significance occurs in three out of four regressions but changes signs. Geography and legal origin have no significance.","The significance of culture was not found in any of the five regression specifications, although economic freedom had a positive and significant impact at a 99% level, providing further support for the substitution theory. Regression (1) revealed that a one unit increase in the freedom index led to a 1.40 percentage point increase in growth. Notably, when educational attainment was included in the regression, the coefficient on freedom almost doubled, and the R-squareds increased from an average of 0.28 to 0.93, indicating severe endogeneity. Education was positively and significantly associated with growth, while all other variables, except for culture, were also significant. This specific regression showed that only investment, population growth, and area were significant, while urban population was significant in three of the four regressions, despite a sign switch. Geography and legal origin were insignificant.","Across all five regression models, culture was observed to be insignificant, while economic freedom had a positive and significant effect at the 99% level, thereby bolstering the substitution theory.

However, when educational attainment was controlled for in the regression, the coefficient on freedom almost doubled, and the R-squared values increased from an average of 0.28 to 0.93, indicating the presence of severe endogeneity. The findings show that education had a strong, positive, and significant relationship with growth, and all variables, except culture, were significant in this particular specification. Significantly, investment, population growth, and area were significant in only this regression, while urban population was significant in three of four regressions, although there was a switch in signs. Geography and legal origin were both insignificant variables."
"Although the inclusion of the supplementary control variables doesn't offer significant explanatory power to the model, as shown by the nearly identical R-squareds to the baseline specification (excluding the education variable), we concede that our model simply accounts for about 25% of the variation in growth. We believe this is due to our careful approach in handling our control variables.","Despite the fact that the additional control variables don't contribute much to clarifying the model, as indicated by the similarity in R-squareds compared to the baseline specification (with the exception of education), we are aware that our model only explains about 25% of the growth variation. We attribute this to our cautious handling of the control variables.","Although the supplementary control variables don't add much explanatory power to the model, as hinted by the analogous R-squareds from the baseline specification (excluding education), we acknowledge that our model only accounts for roughly 25% of the variation in growth.

"Our benchmark and core analysis reveals that culture and economic freedom might act as substitutes. Our study demonstrates that economic institutions that promote private property rights, rule of law, and contracts enforcement are a crucial factor in economic growth. This result is consistent across various regression models. We discovered a small positive association between culture and economic growth, but our analysis indicates that culture only has a statistically significant impact in one of the seven regressions when we control for economic freedom. This observation supports the substitution hypothesis and proposes that culture's relationship with economic growth could be more intricate than previously believed.","Our benchmark and core analysis suggests that culture and economic freedom may act as substitutes.

"In order to directly test the possibility of reverse causality in our study, we conduct a simple check which involves analyzing both lagged and future values of changes in freedom, changes in culture, and our growth rate. We expect changes in income to cause subsequent changes in freedom and culture if reverse causality is driving our findings. Conversely, if freedom or culture is driving growth, we expect changes in these variables to be associated with growth in the following period. For this purpose only, we analyze changes in these variables instead of their levels.","To test for reverse causality more directly, we perform a simple check that involves evaluating lagged and forward-looking changes in freedom, changes in culture, and our growth rate. If our results are being influenced by reverse causality, we anticipate that alterations in income will subsequently lead to modifications in freedom and culture, or both. On the other hand, if freedom or culture is causing growth, we expect changes in these variables to be associated with growth in the succeeding period. Thus, we only examine changes in these variables and not their absolute levels for this particular analysis.","In order to address the possibility of reverse causality, we utilize a simple check that involves examining both past and future changes in freedom, changes in culture, and our growth rate.

Therefore, we analyze changes in these variables, as opposed to their actual levels, for this particular specification only."
"This article presents how the growing economic inequality since the mid-1970s has impacted the US economy and had a devastating effect on social work clientele. The main focus of social workers is social justice, and extreme economic inequality violates this idea. The article investigates how the interrelated changes in ideology, market economy, and governmental policies contributed to the economic crisis, which negatively impacted society. The political economy is compared between the post-World War II decades, which trended towards shared prosperity, and the period since the mid-1970s. The unequal economic and political conditions contributed to economic and political inequality affecting democracy, which ultimately led to the economic meltdown. The text points out the need for social reform and broadening the social movements that strive to achieve social justice, which would reduce the inequality. Additionally, the article elaborates on how social workers can contribute to and participate in social movements striving for equality.","The focus of the article is to emphasize that the economic inequality that has prevailed in the US since the mid-1970s is not just a violation of social justice but has also been dysfunctional for the US economy. It illustrates the effects of growing economic inequality on the social work clientele in the country. The article assessed the changes in ideology, market economy, and government policies, which are interrelated and impacted the economic crisis that negatively affected society. The contrast is made between the political economy of the mid-1970s and the post-World War II decades when the tendency was towards shared prosperity. The article examined how increased economic inequality and political consequences that undermined democracy led to the economic meltdown. The write-up also discusses the implications that the analysis has for social reform and for broadening the constituency of social movements pursuing social justice that aims to reduce economic and political inequality. It highlights the role social workers can play in contributing to solving such issues.","The main message conveyed in the article is that the economic inequality observed since the mid-1970s in the US is not only unjust to social workers, but it also has dysfunctional consequences for the economy. The article points out how economic inequality and its consequences are linked to recent economic problems that have affected social work clientele. The article looks at the changes in the ideology, market economy, and government policies that have happened since the mid-1970s and evaluates how it differed from the preceding post-World War II's shared prosperity era. The article also explored how this increase in economic inequality and undermined democracy, which culminated in the economic meltdown. The analysis suggests that the direction of social reform and social movements towards social justice should embrace widespread support as it would lower economic and political inequality. Lastly, the article relates how social workers can have a meaningful contribution towards reducing economic and political inequality through participation in social reform movements."
"The 65-year period following World War II can be separated into two parts from an economic inequality point of view. The first 30 years of this period saw a decline in inequality, while the following 30 years saw an increase in inequality, ultimately leading to an economic crisis. The article highlights the contrasts between the two periods in terms of income and wealth distribution, wages, unemployment, and poverty. It then goes on to explain the first period's political economy, where there was a connection between the democratic system of government and the capitalist economy. Although inequality remained a prevalent issue in the United States during this time, a new form of capitalism emerged, allowing more individuals to benefit from the growth in national income who were previously unable to do so. Additionally, there was a deliberate pursuit of full employment, which resulted in more people earning higher incomes. Despite being an abnormality in capitalism's history, this era arose due to the federal government's active role in the economy in response to exceptional conditions such as the Great Depression and World War II.","The 65 years that followed World War II can be divided into two distinct periods in terms of economic inequality. The first three decades saw a decrease in inequality, though it was always present, while the following 30 years experienced a surge in inequality, culminating in an economic crisis. The article provides a comparison between the two periods in regards to income and wealth distribution, wages, unemployment, and poverty. It then elaborates on the political economy of the first period, which shows how the democratic system of government was linked to the capitalist economy. Despite inequality remaining a pervasive issue in the U.S., the first period saw a new form of capitalism emerge, known as ""new capitalism,"" which allowed individuals who were previously unable to share in the prosperity of the economy to benefit from the rise in national income. Furthermore, there was a conscious effort towards full employment, which resulted in more people earning higher wages. In retrospect, this may have been an anomaly in capitalism's history that arose due to the federal government's relatively active role in the economy in response to major events such as the Great Depression and World War II.","Looking at economic inequality, the 65 years after World War II can be separated into two parts. The first 30 years showed a decline in inequality, while the subsequent 30 years saw a rise in inequality, ultimately leading to an economic crisis. The article highlights the differences between the two periods in terms of income and wealth distribution, wages, unemployment, and poverty. It then goes on to describe the first period's political economy, where a connection existed between the democratic system of government and the capitalist economy. During this time, a new form of capitalism emerged, known as ""new capitalism,"" which facilitated individuals who were previously unable to share in the economy's prosperity to benefit from the increase in national income. The policy of conscious pursuit of full employment, according to British economist Andrew Shonfield, created this situation and allowed more people to earn higher incomes. This period may have been an anomaly in capitalism's history, as the federal government in response to highly unusual circumstances such as the Great Depression and World War II played a more active role in the economy."
"Economic inequality has been on the rise for the past three decades, which is not a surprising trend. However, the extent of the wealth gap can still astound those who are aware of it. It is an obvious fact that inequality can be seen everywhere, from earnings and income to wealth, poverty, and lack of employment.","Over the last 30 years, the economic inequality has progressively increased, which is not a new phenomenon. Nonetheless, individuals who understand how serious this issue is may still be taken aback by the vastness of the gap. Inequality is pervasive and can be observed across various aspects such as wages, income, wealth, poverty, and joblessness.","The wealth divide has been escalating for the past 30 years, and its expansion is not surprising. Nevertheless, people who acknowledge this economic disparity may still be astonished by the magnitude of it. We can see extreme inequality all around us, whether it be in wages, income, wealth, poverty, or unemployment."
"The top 1 percent of households have experienced exceptional and imbalanced income gains. In 2007, the year before the financial crisis, the richest Americans had an average after-tax income of $1,319,700. This is an increase of $976,120 compared to the 1979 average, while the middle and bottom quintiles only saw increases of $11,200 and $2,400, respectively, in 2007 constant dollars. An analysis of the CBO data by Sherman and Stone of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities revealed that the disparity in after-tax income between the wealthiest 1 percent and the middle and poorest quintiles grew significantly, more than tripling between 1979 and 2007. The data suggests that income concentrations at the top are higher than at any moment since 1928, the previous disastrous financial crash.","The enormous and unequal income gains of the top 1 percent of households are especially egregious. According to a 2010 report from the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the average after-tax income for the wealthiest Americans in 2007, just before the financial collapse, was $1,319,700. This figure marks an increase of $976,120 compared to the 1979 average, whereas the middle and bottom quintiles only saw increases of $11,200 and $2,400, respectively, in 2007 constant dollars. After analyzing the CBO data, Sherman and Stone from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities explained that the income gaps between the wealthiest 1 percent, middle, and poorest fifth of Americans had more than tripled between 1979 and 2007. Based on this research and past studies, Sherman and Stone concluded that income concentration near the top of the income scale had reached its highest point since 1928, which was the year of the previous disastrous financial collapse.","The income gains of the wealthiest 1 percent of households are excessively disproportionate. In 2007, the year before the financial crisis, the average after-tax income for these Americans was $1,319,700, which is an increase of $976,120 over the 1979 average. In comparison, the middle and bottom quintiles only experienced increases of $11,200 and $2,400, respectively, in 2007 constant dollars. The report from the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 2010 confirmed these findings. Sherman and Stone of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analyzed the CBO data and found that the disparity in after-tax income between the top 1 percent and the middle and poorest fifth of Americans grew significantly, more than tripling between 1979 and 2007. As per the researchers, the data implies that the concentration of wealth at the top of the income scale is higher than it has been since 1928, the year of the prior disastrous financial crash."
"Wealth is distributed unevenly, and it is becoming increasingly concentrated in recent years. During the 1995 to 2004 period, despite aggregate household net wealth nearly doubling, the majority of the net gains went to the top quartile of income earners, according to Di (2007). In 2004, the top 10% of individuals owned 71% of private wealth, according to Wolff (2007). Edward Wolff's study entitled Top Heavy, details the emerging inequality of wealth in the country, noting that the title is fitting.","Over the years, wealth inequality has risen with the majority of wealth distribution going towards the top earners. Between 1995 and 2004, there was almost no gain in aggregate household net wealth for the rest of the population, as nearly all of the returns were given to the top quartile of income earners, as said by Di (2007). As of 2004, the richest 10% owned 71% of private wealth, as per Wolff's (2007) findings. Edward Wolff, who is an expert on the topic, wrote a study named ""Top Heavy,"" indicating the escalating wealth inequality in the United States.","Concentration of wealth has become a more pressing concern than income as it is skewed towards the affluent, an unrelenting trend that has been observed in the present era. Di (2007) reported that almost all of the net gains in aggregate household net wealth went to the top 25% of income earners from 1995-2004, despite the fact that there was a near-doubling of household net wealth. According to Wolff's (2007) calculations, the wealthiest ten percent of the population owned 71% of private wealth by 2004. Wolff (1995), a leading scholar in the area, wrote a study named ""Top Heavy,"" summarizing the escalating inequality of wealth in the United States."
"Unemployment during the period of shared prosperity was relatively lower than in the later decades, with an average of 4.8 percent from 1949 to 1973 as compared to an average of 6.5 percent from 1974 to 2008. High unemployment not only leads to lost income and inequality, but also a decline in the potential output for the economy. Additionally, it results in stagnating wages, as employers would not need to raise wages or offer attractive benefits and working conditions when there are more job-seekers than available jobs. In the 1990s, a slight dip in unemployment, although not at full employment, resulted in an increase in wages and benefits, especially for low-wage workers. This happened even though globalization was acting against this trend. The impact of unemployment is not limited to reduced income and tax revenues, but it also results in budget deficits for governments through increased outlays to care for unemployed workers.","Unemployment in the period of shared prosperity was not as high as it has been in recent times, with an average of around 4.8 percent compared to 6.5 percent in the years following. High unemployment can lead to inequality, lost income for workers, and decrease the potential output for the economy. It also results in stagnant wages since employers can hire people without raising salaries or offering enticing working conditions. Conversely, when the labor market is tight, it forces employers to increase wages and benefits, especially for low-wage workers who work hard but often get little in return. Although in the 1990s, unemployment was not at full employment, it was around 4 percent, and there were following increases in salaries and benefits. This happened even though globalization was acting against this trend. Increased rates of unemployment decrease income and tax revenues, which can also increase government spending to help support out-of-work individuals, thus contributing to budget deficits.","During the era of shared prosperity, unemployment rates were not as high as compared to later years, recording at approximately 4.8 percent from 1949 to 1973, whereas it recorded at 6.5 percent from 1974 to 2008. High unemployment can lead to inequality in society, a loss of potential output for the economy, and lost income for workers. In addition, such high unemployment results in stagnating wages because employers could opt to hire workers without raising wages or providing benefits or better working conditions when the number of job seekers is higher than available jobs. On the other hand, a tight labor market can stimulate employers to raise wages and provide better benefits, especially for low-wage workers. Even though unemployment was not at its lowest in the 1990s, hovering around 4 percent, benefits and wages increased. These increases happened despite the challenges of globalization. In summary, unemployment is not only a cause of reduced income and tax revenues but also contributes to government budget deficits through increased spending to support jobless workers."
"The federal government increased its control over the economy during the Great Depression and World War II to address those challenges. As a result, the size and activity of the government expanded from what it was before the Depression. The government's spending and taxing policies helped reduce the severity of recessions and distributed income more fairly. Social welfare measures, such as unemployment compensation, acted as economic stabilizers and reduced the contraction of consumer spending that would have otherwise worsened a downturn. The regulatory policies implemented by the New Deal aimed to prevent another financial speculation disaster like the stock market crash of 1929, and they continued into the post-war era. Higher tax rates that were introduced during World War II were maintained even in peacetime, and in exchange for this, real wages for laborers continued to rise, which helped maintain peace. Despite criticism that the system violated free-market economics, progressive economist Robert Kuttner argued that the system produced nearly three decades of egalitarian economic growth with an average annual growth rate of 3.8%.","In response to the serious challenges posed by the Great Depression and World War II, the federal government expanded its role in the economy. As a result, the American public became accustomed to a larger and more active government than what existed before the Depression. Through government spending and taxing policies, the severity of recessions was decreased, and income was distributed more evenly. Introduced social welfare programs like unemployment compensation functioned as economic stabilizers, expanding during recessions and preventing a decline in consumer spending that would have exacerbated the situation. Regulatory policies created under the New Deal were upheld in the post-war era, which aimed to prevent financial speculation disasters like the stock market crash of 1929. High tax rates used during the wartime period were retained in peacetime to ensure an increase in real wages that provided labor peace. Despite criticisms levied against this system for violating free-market economics, economist Robert Kuttner argued that it generated nearly three decades of equitable economic growth at an average annual rate of 3.8%.","To tackle the challenges posed by the Great Depression and World War II, the federal government significantly grew its involvement in the economy. This led to a larger and more active government than what existed before the Depression, which the American people became accustomed to. Through government spending and taxation policies, recessions' severity was reduced, and income was distributed more fairly. The 1930s social welfare measures, specifically unemployment compensation, became economic stabilizers, expanding during recessions, and reducing the contraction of consumer spending that would have worsened a downturn. The New Deal regulatory policies, including those that aimed to reduce financial speculation that caused the stock market crash of 1929, continued into the first postwar era. The wartime progressive, higher tax rates did not go away in peacetime, ensuring an increase in real wages that supported labor peace. While criticisms were made regarding the violation of free-market economics, economist Robert Kuttner argued that this system allowed nearly three decades of egalitarian economic growth at an average annual growth rate of 3.8%."
"Businesses could have invested in productivity and innovation to eliminate their competitive disadvantage, as per Harrison & Bluestone (1985). However, companies chose alternative approaches that led to increased economic inequality. Strategies implemented included labor squeeze through wage freezes and flexible work patterns, globalization through the relocation of operations to low-wage countries, and the abandonment of production for paper profits resulting in job losses. General Electric and General Motors also shifted their focus to financial services to increase profits. These policies were encouraged by favorable foreign income tax policies and government funding of foreign manufacturing plants. Another policy was to lobby the government for lower taxes and fewer regulations.","Most businesses opted for alternative strategies that aggravated inequality rather than drive productivity and innovation to reduce their competitive disadvantage (Harrison & Bluestone, 1985). Instead, they pursued strategies such as labor squeezing, which involved wage freezes and flexible work arrangements that took away workers' job security. Another tactic was globalization, where businesses transferred operations to low-wage countries, resulting in job losses in the home country. Federal tax policies were instrumental in encouraging this trend by providing more favorable treatment to income earned abroad than on home soil. Businesses also abandoned production for paper profits, with General Electric selling off its consumer appliance division to concentrate on its more profitable credit corporation (Phillips, 2002). General Motors also streamlined its focus on financial services instead of auto production (Wolff, 2009). Another alternative strategy was to lobby the government to reduce taxes and regulations.","To reduce their competitive disadvantage, businesses had the option to invest in productivity and innovation, but most chose alternative strategies that increased inequality (Harrison & Bluestone, 1985). The strategies they opted for included squeezing labor through wage freezes and new work arrangements that increased flexibility but decreased job security. Another strategy was to move operations to low-wage countries through globalization, which resulted in job losses within the home country. The government encouraged this trend by providing more favorable tax policies for income earned abroad. Another strategy was to abandon production for paper profits, as seen with companies such as General Electric selling its consumer appliance division and refocusing on its more profitable credit corporation (Phillips, 2002). General Motors also shifted its focus towards financial services instead of auto production (Wolff, 2009). Another tactic was to lobby government for tax and regulation reductions, which could be exploited for their benefits."
"In the year 1980, the Republicans were able to successfully connect with the fiscally conservative, pro-business part of their voters along with some of the Democrats' New Deal coalition. The Democrats' policies regarding affirmative action, expanding welfare, school busing, women's liberation, gay rights, abortion, and high taxes were unsatisfactory for many former Democratic supporters, even including blue-collar workers. This was observed by Edsall (1991) who noted that the Democratic party was no longer regarded as the source of prosperity it once was.","During the 1980s, the Republicans were able to bring together their fiscally conservative, pro-business voting bloc with a section of the Democrats’ New Deal coalition. Former Democratic voters grew tired of policies such as affirmative action, expanded welfare, school busing, women's liberation, gay rights, abortion, and high taxes, which caused them to defect from the party in large numbers. This included many white people and blue-collar workers, who no longer saw the party as being able to deliver prosperity to their lives. Edsall (1991) noted this shifting trend in his observations.","In the 1980s, the Republicans succeeded in uniting their fiscally conservative, pro-business supporters with a fraction of the Democrats' New Deal coalition. Edsall (1991) observed that a number of former Democratic voters were displeased with issues such as affirmative action, the welfare expansion, school busing, women’s liberation, gay rights, abortion, and perceived high taxes. As a result, many white people, specifically blue-collar workers, no longer associated with the party they once backed. The party was no longer viewed as a provider of prosperity, as noted by Edsall's observations."
"Even though Democrat Bill Clinton was seen as a champion of progressive and populist policies, he played a key role in rescinding AFDC and the GlassSteagall Act, an essential New Deal banking regulation. The removal of this legislation removed the segregation between commercial and investment banks, allowing the latter's high-risk culture to dominate. Additionally, Clinton carried on with the Republican's globalization policies without making significant changes, ignoring concerns for workers' rights and environmental protection.","Despite projecting a progressive and populist image, former Democratic President Bill Clinton oversaw the repeal of two major policies - the AFDC and the GlassSteagall Act - that played a significant role in shaping American society. The dismantling of the GlassSteagall Act led to the merger of commercial and investment banks, enabling the latter's high-risk culture to prevail. Furthermore, Clinton pursued the same globalization policies as his Republican predecessor without addressing concerns about workers' rights and environmental protection.","Despite being known as a progressive and populist politician, Bill Clinton, a former Democrat President, oversaw the elimination of two significant policies that played a crucial role in shaping American society.

"The power of the financial sector was evident in President Bill Clinton's decision to diverge from his populist campaign. Clinton had promised to create an economy that focuses on the needs of the people. However, he quickly recognized that the rich controlled the economy even before taking office, and that reducing deficits would hurt those who voted for him, while benefiting the bond market. Robert Rubin, a co-senior partner of Wall Street's Goldman Sachs and Clinton's National Economic Council's head, pushed for deficit reduction, along with several other advisors.","President-elect Bill Clinton's decision to dismiss his populist campaign ideals demonstrated the financial sector's influence. Clinton had pledged to prioritize the interests of the people in his economy. However, before taking office, he realized that his promises conflicted with the reality that the wealthy controlled the economy.

"The economist Arthur MacEwan (2009) has highlighted the ""nexus of factors"" that contributed to the economic meltdown, including the accumulation of societal and political power among the rich, the elevation of a misguided pro-market ideology, and the rise of inequality. This perspective takes into account the entirety of the economy, from its upper echelons to its lower levels. The ""nexus of factors"" mentioned earlier gave way to the emergence of specific developments such as the expansion of credit, decreased regulation, and the housing bubble, which will be explored in greater detail later.","According to economist Arthur MacEwan (2009), the economic meltdown was caused by a combination of factors that he refers to as the ""nexus of factors."" These include the growing concentration of political and social power within the affluent, the ascendancy of a market-driven ideology that served as an instrument of that power, as well as rising inequality, which both resulted from and reinforced that power. This perspective takes a holistic view of the economy, examining both its highest and lowest stations. The ""nexus of factors"" described earlier set the stage for other developments that occurred leading up to the economic collapse, such as increased credit, deregulation, and the housing bubble, which will be analyzed further later on.","Economist Arthur MacEwan (2009) has emphasized that the economic meltdown was brought on by a combination of factors he calls the ""nexus of factors.""

"The concentration of media ownership in the United States led to a limitation of viewpoints available to the public. In the span of 21 years, from 1983 to 2004, there was a noticeable decline in the number of corporations controlling media outlets such as newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations, book publishers, and movie companies. According to a non-profit watchdog group, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), mergers in the news industry promoted the acceleration of such consolidation, reducing the variety of perspectives that had access to mass media. As a result, the viewpoints presented by the media were closely tied to the interests of their owners.","The United States faced a notable limitation of viewpoints owing to what is known as “media monopoly”. Between 1983 and 2004, a decline of media ownership from 50 to 5 corporations presented control over most TV and radio stations, newspapers, magazines, book publishers, and movie companies. The non-profit watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) pointed out that news industry mergers intensified resulting in a reduction of various perspectives that had access to mass media coverage. Therefore, the media’s viewpoints were strongly connected to their owner's interests.","The United States witnessed a limitation in the diversity of opinions offered due to the increasing ""media monopoly"" phenomenon.

A non-profit media watchdog, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), deemed that the news industry's consolidation resulted in a further decline in the range of viewpoints available to the public. As a consequence, the media's perspectives heavily reflected the interests and priorities of their owners."
"The belief that the political economies of capitalist countries are not uniform is supported by the contrasting views on agency and choice. Certain countries are not as wary of ""big government"" as others. Varied research shows that wealthy capitalist countries differ greatly in terms of poverty reduction and the extent of their welfare states. Although most welfare states have been reduced in recent years, relative poverty rates across nations show significant differences. For instance, in 2000, France and Germany had poverty rates of 7.3% and 8.4%, respectively, whereas the United States had a poverty rate of 17.0%. Compared to the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada had lower poverty rates of 13.7% and 12.4%, sequentially. Various countries like the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden had significantly lower rates, ranging from 5.4% to 6.6%.

Some nations are less apprehensive about ""big government."" Through cross-national research, it has been determined that prosperous capitalist nations vary greatly concerning poverty reduction and the size and reach of their welfare programs. Despite cutbacks to welfare programs in almost all nations, rates of poverty vary significantly. For instance, in the year 2000, relative poverty rates of 7.3% and 8.4% were recorded in France and Germany, respectively, while the US had twice the amount at 17.0%.

"Derivatives were employed to decrease the risk of subprime mortgages. Nonetheless, these tricky financial tools were a critical component of the housing bubble, its collapse and the subsequent financial bailouts. Credit-default swaps are one example of derivatives that banks bought to insure packages of mortgage loans. These swaps were named credit-default swaps to avoid regulation because insurance was already heavily regulated. In 1998, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair proposed regulating these derivatives. Still, Bill Clinton's Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Deputy Lawrence Summers, and Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan contested this proposal.","To minimize the risk associated with subprime mortgages, derivatives were used. Derivatives, which were complex financial instruments, were a significant aspect of the housing bubble and collapse, as well as the ensuing bailout.

Because insurance was already heavily regulated, the sellers of insurance on these loans called them ""credit default swaps"" to avoid further regulation.

"Based on the analysis, it is evident that the key to recovery and improvement is to implement certain measures. Reregulation of the financial sector, reducing the control of the economic elite in politics, and promoting a more progressive labor movement are necessary to combat the issue of economic inequality. Additionally, policies must be put in place to enhance the well-being of lower- and middle-income populations. This includes increasing the scope and benefits of social welfare, ensuring that everyone who wants to work has access to a living wage job, and facilitating better access to healthcare, housing, childcare, and public transportation. By doing so, individuals can better address their needs without accruing debt beyond their means.","The prescription for addressing economic inequality can be inferred from the analysis. To mitigate this issue, the financial sector must be reregulated, the influence of economic elites in politics should be reduced, and a stronger labor movement must be fostered. Policies to combat inequality include expanding the range of social welfare benefits and elevating their level, guaranteeing living-wage jobs for all, and ensuring availability and affordability of healthcare, housing, childcare, and public transportation. This would empower lower- and middle-income consumers to satisfy their needs without being compelled to accrue unsustainable debt.","Based on the analysis, it is suggested that the key to overcoming economic inequality is to take certain steps.

"The New Deal work programs devised and executed by social workers Harry Hopkins and Aubrey Williams were similar to the present-day job creation initiatives, but it is critical to improve the latter. The work programs of the New Deal era failed to employ women and minorities according to their requirements. Enhancing the workforce model can lead to better opportunities in fields like social services, child care, elder care, education, and health care, while focusing on physical infrastructure. Creating a new industrial policy to rekindle U.S. manufacturing can offer increased chances for productive investments and reduce the financial sector's dependency. Nonetheless, these changes demand a significant commitment from the federal government (Rose, 2010; Pollin & Baker, 2009).","The job creation initiatives in vogue resemble the work programs of the New Deal introduced by social workers Aubrey Williams and Harry Hopkins. Though groundbreaking, the New Deal's workforce programs failed to provide women and minorities with suitable employment opportunities. Improving the New Deal model is vital, and priority should be given to fields like social services, education, child and elder care, and health care, along with the physical infrastructure. Besides, creating a new industrial policy to promote U.S. manufacturing can lead to more job openings and reduce reliance on the financial sector. However, these changes would require considerable government involvement (Rose, 2010; Pollin & Baker, 2009).","The present job creation initiatives remind us of the New Deal work programs that Harry Hopkins and Aubrey Williams, social workers, planned and administered.

"Despite the global financial crisis caused by their failures, financial interests on Wall Street remain powerful. The free market and hands-off government ideology may be declining, but the money changers still hold a significant amount of sway. While the stock market has recovered, unemployment remained high for months. The financial industry is actively lobbying to weaken regulatory reform, outnumbering consumer advocates 25 to one by late 2009, and spending nearly $600 million to achieve their goals. Congress implemented the first regulatory legislation in a generation in July 2010, but financial interests are hoping to use their considerable influence to succeed in their aims for implementation. (Johnson & Kwak, 2010) (Lichtblau, 2010)","Despite the recession and failures of the financial industry, financial interests continue to hold a significant amount of power on Wall Street. While the ideology of the free market and hands-off government may be losing its popularity, the money changers remain in the temple.

Financial interests have been heavily lobbying against reregulation, with lobbyists for banks and other businesses outnumbering consumer advocates 25 to one by the end of 2009.

"Despite previous involvement in government job creation back in the 1930s, social workers have traditionally focused more on welfare than job creation. Nonetheless, given the social and economic effects of unemployment, including loss of income and social roles, social workers can make a difference in reducing inequality by supporting organizations that advocate for direct job creation by the government. In addition, they can support initiatives such as living wage campaigns, efforts to raise the minimum wage and Earned Income Tax Credit, and building a robust labor movement that advocates for the working class. Social workers joining unions can help to achieve these goals by advocating for reforms that benefit all workers, not just union members. Finally, supporting the Employee Free Choice Act 0f 2009 would help make it easier for workers to join unions while also reducing firing, harassment, and other anti-union practices.","In the 1930s, social workers played a significant role in government job creation, but the focus of the profession has since shifted to welfare instead of work. Unfortunately, even half of the current unemployment rate still leaves millions of people without jobs or with marginal employment opportunities. The social and economic effects of this issue include loss of income and social roles, which can exacerbate inequality. To help reduce inequality, social workers can advocate for direct job creation by the government and support living-wage campaigns, initiatives to raise the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit, and a stronger labor movement. By supporting the Employee Free Choice Act of 2009 (H.R. 1409), social workers can help make it easier for workers to join unions and to advocate for labor reforms that benefit all workers, not just union members. Joining a union is also an effective way for social workers to support labor movement goals and promote improvements for workers.","In the 1930s, some social workers played a prominent part in the government's job creation efforts. However, the profession nowadays focuses more on welfare than work. Unemployment rates, even at half the current levels, still leave millions of people jobless or working on the margins, which inevitably leads to a host of social and economic issues, including income loss and societal dislocation. Social workers can help reduce inequality by supporting organizations that advocate for direct job creation by the government. They can also support living wage campaigns and initiatives designed to raise the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit. Strengthening the labor movement would also go a long way towards this goal and elevate the voice of the working class. The Employee Free Choice Act of 2009 (H.R. 1409), which would make it easier for workers to join unions without fear of harassment or firing, is an essential step in the right direction. Social workers can also help advocate for reforms that benefit all workers, not just union members, by joining unions themselves."
"The elevated expense of meeting basic family requirements is an indication that several families, including social workers, who earn a higher income than the median are under considerable pressure and vulnerable to the dangers of predatory lending. It raises the question of who is responsible for protecting these families from becoming prey to such financial predators? In the past, settlements fulfilled this task and advocated for the implementation of protective and regulatory laws. In addition, social workers should promote the enactment and implementation of recently passed laws as well as provide consumer education for effective consumer protection.","The high expenditure associated with meeting elementary family needs highlights the financial burden faced by families with incomes above the median, including social workers, who are often susceptible to predatory lending. The question that arises is, who is responsible for protecting these families from predatory financial practices?

"The nation of Greece joined the Eurozone in 2001 and initially enjoyed a brief period of economic prosperity before encountering a significant financial crisis about nine years later. The economic landscape experienced a significant shift between the time of Greece's entry into the Eurozone and their reception of a collaborative bailout package from the IMF/EU. I employ this scenario to put the economic voting hypothesis to the test. Through the examination of longitudinal aggregate data dating from 1981 to 2009, I explore the association between certain macroeconomic factors and the vote percentage of the ruling political party, testing the ""grievance asymmetry"" concept. I also analyze individual-level data spanning from 2004 to 2009 to assess the degree to which retrospective sociotropic evaluations of the economy are linked to backing for the ruling party. The results suggest that sociotropic economic evaluations are closely linked to support for the party in power, but at times when the economy is in disarray, the ruling party has little opportunity for success and can only count on loyal followers for support.","Greece's inclusion into the Eurozone in 2001 spurred an initial phase of economic elation, which was followed shortly after by a significant financial disaster. Between the nation's initial entry into the Eurozone and the approval of the joint IMF/EU bailout agreement, the economic situation encountered by Greek voters transformed radically. I utilize this circumstance as a means of assessing the economic voting hypothesis. Based on aggregate longitudinal data ranging from 1981 to 2009, I examine the association between macroeconomic indicators and the incumbent political party's vote share to determine if the ""grievance asymmetry"" theory holds any weight. Furthermore, with individual-level data spanning from 2004 through to 2009, I explore to what extent retrospective sociotropic evaluations concerning the state of the economy correlate with support for the party in power. The results show that sociotropic economic assessments are linked to backing for the ruling party, but during periods of economic turbulence, the incumbent party has very little chance of winning and should only rely on the support of die-hard loyal supporters.","Greece's entry into the Eurozone in 2001 resulted in a brief period of economic optimism prior to a significant financial crisis almost a decade later. From the time Greece became a part of the Eurozone until they accepted a joint IMF/EU bailout package, the economic condition that Greek voters were confronted with underwent a dramatic transformation. I choose to utilize this setting to put the economic voting hypothesis to the test. Using longitudinal aggregate data spanning from 1981 to 2009, my investigation examines the connection between macroeconomic indicators and the incumbent party's vote share to verify the ""grievance asymmetry"" hypothesis. Additionally, by employing individual-level data that spans from 2004 to 2009, I investigate the degree to which sociotropic assessments of the state of the economy impact support for the ruling party. The findings indicate that evaluations of the economy's condition are linked to support for the government, but if the economy is at its worst, the incumbent party has little chance of winning and should only expect to receive support from their loyal fan base."

"Economic voting involves rational judgments by voters about the past performance of the economy. While prospective evaluations can be important, voters' perceptions and appraisals of policy and performance are key to their decision-making. According to Key, voters are not fools, and their evaluations can hold the government accountable. Fiorina expanded on this concept by suggesting that even uninformed voters can base their decisions on what life has been like during the incumbent's administration. Based on such evaluations, voters can elect or punish the government, making it relatively straightforward to either reward or replace the administration.","The concept of economic voting suggests that voters make rational judgments about the past performance of the economy, rather than being foolish in their decision-making.

Expanding on this idea, Fiorina suggested even uninformed voters can make decisions based on their experiences during the incumbent's administration. These evaluations can be used to reward the government and re-elect them, or to punish them and vote for the opposition.

"There is insufficient systematic analysis of economic voting behavior in Greece, and our understanding of this subject is primarily based on the study conducted by Freire and Costa Lobo in 2005. They analyzed the relationship between objective economic indicators and subjective perceptions of the economy relating to voting behavior in Greece, Portugal, and Spain from 1984 to 1999. According to their study, Greece showed a correlation between personal financial perceptions and GDP changes. Furthermore, the authors used Eurobarometer data to evaluate the role of the economy in party choice between 1985 and 2000 and found that ideology was the most significant aspect. While the importance of economic evaluations in relation to party preference has not been empirically tested for recent elections, economic voting at the aggregate level will be examined before exploring individual-level data.","Due to a lack of systematic analysis of economic voting in Greece, our present knowledge on this subject comes primarily from a comparative study by Freire and Costa Lobo (2005) and a case study analysis by the same authors.

"The incumbent party's support is related to macroeconomic performance via the reward-punishment hypothesis. This concept proposes that voters assess a government's economic indicators, such as inflation and unemployment, and then reward or penalize the party in power based on their performance in maintaining these metrics at desirable levels. Essentially, economic policy-making falls to the accountability of the government. Furthermore, opposing political parties can expect to gain support if voters are dissatisfied with the incumbent party's performance. Sanders discussed this concept in 2000, while Lewis-Beck in 1988 and Powell and Whitten in 1993 previously mentioned it.","The reward-punishment hypothesis explains the correlation between macroeconomic performance and the incumbent party's support. According to this theory, major economic indicators, such as inflation and unemployment, are evaluated by voters, who then reward or punish the current party based on its success in keeping these indicators at desirable levels. In other words, governments are held accountable for their economic policy-making decisions. Furthermore, underperforming incumbent parties can expect opposing parties to gain voter support. Sanders discussed this concept in 2000, while Lewis-Beck in 1988 and Powell and Whitten in 1993 previously mentioned it.","The reward-punishment hypothesis is the main argument that connects macroeconomic performance to the incumbent party's support. This hypothesis suggests that voters assess a government's performance on major economic indicators, such as inflation or unemployment, and then reward or punish the incumbent party based on their ability to maintain these indicators at desirable levels. Simply put, governments are responsible for their economic policymaking decisions. Additionally, opposing political parties can gain voter support when voters consider the incumbent party's performance insufficient. This concept was discussed by Sanders in 2000 and was previously described by Lewis-Beck in 1988 and Powell and Whitten in 1993."
"The theory of Mueller about voters solely reacting to economic circumstances if there is a drastic downturn is supported by research data from Germany and the United Kingdom (as cited in Nannestad and Paldam, 1997, p.85). However, can this proposition be extended to the level of individual voter analysis? Prior attempts to verify the ""grievance hypothesis"" at an individual level (referencing Kiewiet, 1983 and Lewis-Beck, 1988) were not successful, except for when studying the Danish electorate (Nannestad and Paldam, 1997). Conversely, van der Bruget al.'s cross-national evaluation of economic voting discovered proof supporting the ""grievance asymmetry"" hypothesis, which contends that economic voting is dependent on the direction of economic change. Instead of anticipating the coefficients on improving economic conditions to hover around zero (Lewis-Beck, 1988, p.78), the authors reported significant differences in the impact's magnitude between improving and deteriorating economic conditions (van der Brug et al., 2007, pp.142-159).","Research data from Germany and the United Kingdom confirms Mueller's belief that voters only respond to economic circumstances in the event of a drastic downturn (referencing Nannestad and Paldam, 1997, p.85). But does this principle also apply to analyzing individual voters? Prior attempts to validate the ""grievance hypothesis"" at the individual level (as cited in Kiewiet, 1983 and Lewis-Beck, 1988) were fruitless, except for one notable example involving the Danish electorate (Nannestad and Paldam, 1997). Conversely, van der Brug et al.'s multinational assessment of economic voting discovered evidence supporting the ""grievance asymmetry"" hypothesis, which argues that whether or not voters choose to vote is dependent on the nature of economic change. In contrast to expecting coefficients on improving economic conditions to be near zero (Lewis-Beck, 1988, p.78), the authors found significant differences in the scope of the effect between improving and deteriorating economic conditions (van der Brug et al., 2007, pp.142-159).","The hypothesis of Mueller regarding voters only reacting to economic circumstances if there is a sharp downturn receives support from research data in Germany and the United Kingdom (referencing Nannestad and Paldam, 1997, p.85). However, what about the applicability of this hypothesis to examining individual voters? Earlier efforts to verify the ""grievance hypothesis"" at an individual level (as cited in Kiewiet, 1983 and Lewis-Beck, 1988) proved unsuccessful, with the exception of examining the Danish electorate (Nannestad and Paldam, 1997). Conversely, van der Brug et al.'s multinational study of economic voting discovered evidence supporting the ""grievance asymmetry"" hypothesis, which claims that whether or not voters choose to vote is dependent on the direction of economic change. Instead of the coefficients on improving economic conditions being expected to be near zero (Lewis-Beck, 1988, p.78), the authors discovered considerable variations in the magnitude of the impact between improving and deteriorating economic conditions (van der Brug et al., 2007, pp.142-159)."
"The outcomes of previous individual-level simulations relating to elections and economic conditions in Greece suggested that voters responded positively to the enhancements in the country's economy, leading to a reward for the governing party regarding their vote intentions. Greece's lack of coalition governments made it easy for voters to pinpoint the party accountable for governmental actions, resulting in a high-clarity political setting. Greece's political system is known for having stable single-party governments due to its disproportionate electoral system referred to as ""reinforced proportional representation"" that has been modified numerous times since the return to democracy in 1974. All parties, except for the quasicaretaker coalition governments of 1989-1990, have remained in opposition while ND and PASOK have taken turns in government.","According to previous individual-level simulations exploring the impact of economic changes on the electoral results in Greece, voters tended to reward the governing party when the economy improved. This happened slightly more than they gave them punishments. Greece has a political setting with high-clarity for voters due to the country's lack of coalition governments. It's easy to identify the party accountable for government policies. The political system in Greece has been stable with single-party governments due to the disproportional electoral system called ""reinforced proportional representation,"" which has undergone several changes since the restoration of democracy in 1974. Except for 1989-1990's quasicaretaker coalition governments, the ND and PASOK have served in government by alternating roles, while all other parties remained in opposition.","Previous simulations analyzing the effect of economic changes on elections in Greece at the individual-level disclosed that voters responded positively to advancements in the country's economy, granting the governing party a reward in terms of vote intentions. They were slightly more likely to do so than to punish the governing party. Greece's absence of coalition governments allowed voters to easily identify the party responsible for government policies, making it a high-clarity country. Since democracy's restoration in 1974, Greece has a stable single-party government system, partly thanks to the disproportional electoral system known as ""reinforced proportional representation,"" which has undergone multiple revisions. With the exception of 1989-1990's quasicaretaker coalition governments, the ND and PASOK have traded positions in government, while all other parties have remained in opposition."
"The plot observable in Fig. 1 (bandwidth of 0.7) presents an ambiguous view, but some indications suggest the presence of an asymmetry between the economy's state's fluctuations and the incumbent party's vote share. Upon scrutinizing macroeconomic indicators in isolation, we become cognizant of the association between a downturn in GDP and a decline in the incumbent party's vote share and vice versa, where an upturn in GDP rewards incumbents only up to a threshold of 2.5% change. Also, inflation up to 17% does not deter the voters' inclination towards the ruling party; instead, they seem to be slightly rewarding the party. Conversely, after the same threshold, there is a sharp decrease in the incumbent party's vote share. Similarly, changes in the unemployment rate from -1% to 1% are insignificant factors with respect to changes in the ruling party's vote share. Still, as with inflation, a pronounced trend recurs after the threshold, signaling punishment for incumbents, albeit the sample size beyond the threshold is meager.","In Fig. 1, the scatterplots (0.7 bandwidth) exhibit an inconclusive picture, but certain evidence proposes an asymmetry amid fluctuations in the economy's state and the vote share possessed by the governing party. The study of each macroeconomic indicator by itself reveals that a fall in GDP is correlated with a drop in the incumbent party's vote share and vice versa. The indications display that an upswing in GDP is a reward to incumbents, but only up till a threshold of 2.5% change. Inflation is another area of study, where voters don’t seem to penalize the ruling party for a rise in the inflation rate of up to about 17%; instead, they tend to reward them slightly. However, beyond this threshold, there is a noticeable and steep downfall of the incumbent party's vote share. Similarly, changes in the unemployment rate ranging from -1% to 1% reveal no observable effect on changes in the incumbent party's vote share. But, just like inflation, there is a sharp trend past the threshold, hinting at punishment for incumbents. Nevertheless, the number of observations beyond the threshold limit is small.","The scatterplots shown in Fig. 1 (with 0.7 bandwidth) present a mixed viewpoint, but there are some indications of an asymmetry between the fluctuations in the state of the economy and the vote share of the governing party. Examining each macroeconomic indicator individually shows that decreases in GDP are connected to drops in the vote share of the incumbent party and vice versa, but a threshold of 2.5% change seems to be the point where incumbents no longer receive rewards for improving growth indicators. Analyzing inflation demonstrates that up to around 17%, increases in the inflation rate are not linked to a decline in the vote share of the incumbent party. Furthermore, voters appear to be slightly rewarding the party. Yet, beyond this threshold, there is a marked decline in the vote share for the ruling party. The same holds for changes in the unemployment rate, where adjustments between -1% and 1% do not seem to affect the vote share of the governing party. Nevertheless, as with inflation, after the threshold, there is a pronounced trend signifying a punishment for incumbents, but the number of observations beyond this threshold is minimal."
"To investigate the impact of economic variables on the support for the incumbent party, I performed a logistic regression analysis. I coded the dependent variable as 1 with the intention to vote for the incumbent and 0 for voting for any other opposition party, which has been previously established by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2000) and Evans and Andersen (2006). The logistic regression model enabled me to estimate the probability of voters selecting the incumbent party compared to others, and to analyze how this probability changes based on shifts in economic perceptions. Nonetheless, it is known that in most studies, vote choice is influenced by temporary factors such as economic evaluations, long-term effects such as party identification and ideology, and demographic factors like age and gender (Clarke et al., 2004).","As my research focused on the impact of economic variables on support for the incumbent party, I employed a logistic regression analysis. My dependent variable was coded as 1 to indicate an intention to vote for the incumbent and as 0 for any other opposition party, based on the established coding by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau (2000) and Evans and Andersen (2006). Through the use of logistic regression models, I was able to estimate the likelihood of a voter selecting the incumbent party and track how this likelihood changes as perceptions of the economy evolve. However, it should be noted that vote choice is typically impacted by a range of factors including temporary effects like economic evaluations, long-term effects like party identification and ideology, and demographic features such as age and gender (Clarke et al., 2004).","To understand how economic variables influence support for the incumbent party, I conducted a logistic regression analysis. The dependent variable was coded as 1 for those intending to vote for the incumbent party and 0 for those intending to vote for opposition parties, which was a coding method that had been previously established (Lewis-Beck and Nadeau, 2000; Evans and Andersen, 2006). Utilizing logistic regression models, I was able to estimate the likelihood of a voter selecting the incumbent party compared to other parties, and observe how this likelihood changes when economic perceptions shift. Nevertheless, as is common in most studies, vote choice is influenced by various factors such as temporary effects such as economic evaluations, long-term effects such as party identification and ideology, and demographic factors like age and gender (Clarke et al., 2004)."
"When comparing the 2004 and 2009 elections, Fig. 2 shows a rise of almost 20% in the percentage of voters who had a negative evaluation of the economy. The importance of the economy as the most pressing issue for voters increased considerably, and economic issues such as inflation and unemployment were the most significant for voters in both years. The Greek public indicated that the economy, inflation, and unemployment were the most important issues the country faced during both elections. The importance of the economy as an election issue became more critical in 2009, followed by a decrease in unemployment's significance as an issue. In both surveys, the economy had to be a crucial element in voters' minds for economic considerations to impact their overall voting decisions.","According to Fig. 2, the percentage of voters who evaluated the economy negatively increased by almost 20% when comparing the 2004 and 2009 elections. In 2004, the percentage of voters who thought the economy was a lot worse was only 24.4%, compared to a significant increase in 2009, where it increased to 43.9%. The study found that the economy had to be a significant concern for voters if economic considerations were to play an important role in their decisions. Both surveys asked respondents an open-ended question to name the most pressing problem the country faced. Both the 2004 and 2009 elections showed that economic issues, including inflation and unemployment, were by far the most significant for voters, surpassing concerns about health, immigration, education, and the environment. There was a notable shift from 2004 to 2009, with the economy's importance as the most significant problem increasing, followed by a decline in the importance of unemployment as an issue.","From Fig. 2, the comparison between the 2004 and 2009 elections suggests that the percentage of voters who evaluated the economy negatively rose by almost 20%. It is worth noting that economic considerations had to be at the forefront of voters' minds for a significant impact on their overall voting decision. The study employed an open-ended question to determine issue salience, which measured the most critical issue facing their country. Respondents could name up to two issues in the 2004 survey and up to three in the 2009 poll. In both elections, economic problems, including inflation and unemployment, were the most significant, surpassing concerns regarding healthcare, immigrant-related issues, education, and the environment. Notably, as the elections moved from 2004 to 2009, the importance of the economy as the most pressing issue increased by almost 20%, followed by a decline in the understanding of unemployment as the most significant issue."
"Table 1 illustrates the empirical outcomes of the study, which demonstrate that the economic variable coefficients align with the initial hypothesis and are statistically significant. The research found that in the 2004 national election, those on the left side of the ideological spectrum were more likely to support the socialist governing party, PASOK, as were those who identified with the incumbent and viewed the economic situation positively in the year preceding the election. Additionally, none of the sociodemographic variables had any considerable significance. The pattern observed in 2009 was repeated. Voters with a favorable view of the economy were more likely to vote for the incumbent party, which happened to be the right-wing ND. As a result, individuals on the right side of the ideological spectrum also inclined towards the ND. The study concluded that economic evaluations held by the Greek electorate had a significant effect on support for the incumbent party, even when the macroeconomic measures indicated favorable outcomes as was the case in 2004.","The empirical outcomes of the study are presented in Table 1, and the results support the initial hypothesis. The statistical analysis shows that the coefficients for the economic variable are significant and aligned as expected. The study also found that, in the 2004 national election, individuals on the left side of the ideological spectrum were more likely to support the socialist party, PASOK. This pattern remained consistent in voters who held a positive perception of the economy and those who identified with the incumbent. Furthermore, the sociodemographic factors were not found to have any significant effect. The same tendencies were observed in the 2009 election, where individuals with a positive view of the economy were more likely to vote for the incumbent, the conservative ND. As a result, voters on the right also tended to shift toward the ND. The study concludes that the Greek electorate's economic evaluations hold tremendous significance in supporting the incumbent party, regardless of whether the macroeconomic figures indicate a favorable outcome.","The findings of the research are presented in Table 1, which provides empirical evidence that supports the initial hypothesis. The statistical analysis indicates that the coefficients for the economic variable are significant and correspond to the predicted direction. The study reveals that in the 2004 national election, voters who identified with the left side of the ideological spectrum were more inclined to support the socialist party, PASOK. Similarly, individuals who held a positive view of the economy in the previous year and those who identified with the incumbent showed similar voting patterns. Furthermore, none of the sociodemographic factors were found to have a statistically significant impact. The same pattern emerged in the 2009 election, where voters who held an optimistic opinion of the economy were more likely to vote for the incumbent, the conservative ND. Consequently, individuals on the right side of the political spectrum also tended to support ND. The research concludes that the Greek electorate's economic evaluations play a crucial role in supporting the incumbent party, even when the macroeconomic figures indicate a positive economic outcome, as seen in 2004."
"Addressing endogeneity in regression models based on cross-sectional data is challenging as we don't have suitable exogenous instruments. Instead, a counterfactual argument is presented. If we think of endogeneity as an omitted variable problem, we need to consider the potential effect size of this variable to invalidate the findings presented in Table 1. Given that the model includes powerful predictors such as party identification and left-right self-placement, it's difficult to conceive of another explanatory variable that could predict incumbent party support with an odds ratio of at least 1.8.3. Thus, it's reasonable to conclude that while the impact of economic evaluations on incumbent support may be overestimated, it is still a credible effect.","It is problematic to address endogeneity in cross-sectional data regression models because there is a lack of suitable exogenous instruments.

"The article aims to investigate how the economy affects voting behavior in Greece during the 2004 and 2009 elections and how it relates to support for incumbent parties. The findings suggest that, in line with other countries, Greek voters tend to penalize the ruling party when the economy deteriorates rather than reward them when the conditions improve. However, the techniques used to analyze the data have limitations, and it is challenging to draw definite conclusions.

"Figs. 4 and 5 demonstrate a correlation between positive evaluations about the economy and an increase in the likelihood to vote for the incumbent party. However, the confidence intervals between the adjacent plots for different levels of evaluation overlap, suggesting that changes in mean evaluations among the electorate may not significantly affect the probability of voting for the incumbent party, with the exception of the shift from ""much worse"" to ""much better"" evaluations in 2004. Additionally, Figs. 4 and 5 indicate that a party's position on the Left-Right scale may impact the gains made from positive evaluations about the economy. PASOK's centrist position allows them to gain support across the ideological spectrum, whereas right-wing ND faces uncertainty when trying to gain support from the left. This study utilized expert surveys, including the 2003 Benoit and Laver (2006) survey for the 2004 election and the Vowles and Xezonakis (2009) survey for the 2009 election.","The probability of voting for the incumbent party appears to increase as evaluations about the economy turn more positive, as depicted in Figs. 4 and 5.

"The results do not imply that there was no economic voting in 2009. It is affirmed that economic evaluations played a crucial role in both elections, but it didn't have a substantial impact in terms of electoral returns for the party in government, which can be concluded from the evidence in Figs. 4 and 5. Especially in 2009, the high odds ratio of about 23.7 meant that only the most loyal supporters of the conservatives intended to vote for the incumbent ND, as confirmed by the parliamentary election of October 2009, where ND had the worst electoral result in its 35-year history, as per Gemenis (2010, 358).","While the results don't indicate that there was no economic voting that took place in 2009, it is confirmed that economic evaluations indeed played a significant role in both elections. However, when we consider the evidence presented in Figs. 4 and 5, it is concluded that this important role didn't have a substantial impact on electoral returns for the party in government. In particular, the parliamentary election of October 2009 showed that the high odds ratio of about 23.7 for party identification in Table 1 only meant that the loyal supporters of the conservatives intended to vote for the incumbent ND. This was further confirmed by ND's worst electoral result in its 35-year history.","The outcomes do not suggest that there was no economic voting in 2009, rather they confirm that economic assessments played a vital role in both elections. However, the evidence presented in Figs. 4 and 5 leads to the conclusion that this crucial role was not substantial enough to affect electoral returns for the party in governance. This is particularly true for the parliamentary election of October 2009, where the high odds ratio of about 23.7 for party identification in Table 1 indicated that in June 2009 only the most loyal supporters of the conservatives intended to vote for the incumbent ND. The authenticity of this indication was solidified by the election result in which ND had their worst performance in the last 35 years, as reported by Gemenis (2010, 358)."
"The literature pertaining to economic voting has proven that good economic performance is beneficial to those in power during elections. However, there is still an ongoing debate regarding whether those in vulnerable economic situations are more prone to casting economic votes. This article suggests that a crucial element in explaining individual-level variation in economic voting is the level of exposure to economic risks, as it has a direct impact on how important the economy is in voting choices. In particular, the article concentrates on job insecurity and employability as being central to economic voting patterns. It hypothesizes that the level of economic voting is greater for those who are more vulnerable to unemployment and less able to find alternative work in the case of job loss. The results of the test, which used a dataset combining both survey data on incumbent support and occupational unemployment rates, as well as other measures of exposure to economic risks, supported the hypotheses.","According to economic voting literature, an incumbent's chances of winning are higher when the economic performance is impressive. However, there is still a disagreement as to whether voters in feeble economic conditions are more prone to engage in economic voting. This article proposes that the degree of exposure to economic risks plays a significant role in explaining variations in individual-level economic voting, as risk exposure directly impacts the significance of the economy in voting decisions. The article focuses on job insecurity and employability as key determinants of economic voting patterns. It conjectures that voters who are more vulnerable to unemployment and less employable in case of job loss are more likely to vote based on economic reasons. Analysis of the dataset, which combined survey data on incumbent support with occupational unemployment rates and other indicators of exposure to economic risks, supported the hypotheses.","The literature on economic voting demonstrates that incumbents' chances of re-election are boosted by good economic performance. Nevertheless, the question persists as to whether voters in vulnerable economic conditions are more inclined to engage in economic voting. In this article, it is argued that the level of exposure to economic risks is a critical factor that explains individual-level variations in economic voting because risk exposure directly impacts the importance of the economy in voting decisions. Job insecurity and employability are viewed as key determinants of economic voting patterns, with the article hypothesizing that the level of economic voting is higher in voters who are more susceptible to unemployment and have fewer employment opportunities in the event of job loss. The hypotheses are supported by a test using a dataset that combines survey data on incumbent support with occupational unemployment rates and other measures of exposure to economic risks."
"Economic voting is a well-researched topic in political science, which examines the relationship between economic factors and electoral outcomes. While there are some disagreements in the literature, the idea that macroeconomic performance is a critical determinant in democratic elections has become widely accepted among the general public and popular media. However, recent research has challenged this notion in two main areas: individual constraints and institutional factors. Studies show that individuals vary significantly in their ability and willingness to obtain information about the economy, and political institutions can play a significant role in influencing voters' perceptions of incumbents' economic performance.","Political science has thoroughly examined the connection between economic factors and electoral outcomes, which is known as economic voting. Despite debates in some areas of the literature, most people outside the field of study and the media agree that macroeconomic performance is a crucial determinant in democratic elections. However, recent research has called this idea into question regarding two key empirical and theoretical dimensions - individual constraints and institutional factors. Studies indicate that people's abilities and willingness to acquire information about the economy vary greatly, and political institutions can significantly affect how voters hold incumbents accountable for economic outcomes.","There is a vast amount of literature in political science that centers around the nexus between economic factors and electoral outcomes, which is called economic voting.

One the one hand, studies suggest that individuals vary significantly in their ability and willingness to obtain information about the economy. On the other hand, political institutions can powerfully influence economic voting by shaping how voters hold incumbents responsible for economic performance."
"This article aims to make two significant contributions to the economic voting literature. Firstly, it seeks to identify individual-level differences in voting behavior by drawing on the insights from political science literature. The study explores the factors that mediate the relationship between macroeconomic performance and incumbent support, with a particular focus on 'skills' and professional job insecurity, which are key sources for social policy preferences and welfare state arrangements, but still remain largely unexplored for economic voting. Secondly, the study offers new empirical evidence that suggests voters respond differently to variations in macroeconomic performance based on their position in the labor market.

"The issue of how individual economic conditions influence voting patterns has been largely ignored in economic voting studies. Most scholars have regarded the economy as a 'valence issue', where all voters desire a good economy. As a result, many studies have centered on responsibility attribution, assuming that economic performance's significance remains constant across individual voters. However, some classic studies have provided a theoretical basis for exploring how group variances in responsiveness to macroeconomic signals may impact economic voting patterns, such as Hibbs' (1977) famous research that demonstrated differences across the electorate in response to indicators such as inflation and unemployment.","Economic voting studies have been hesitant to investigate how individual economic circumstances affect voting behavior. Stokes (1963) coined the term 'valence issue,' which implies that all voters prefer a good economy to a poor one. Responsibility assignment has been the primary focus of numerous studies, where scholars have assumed that voters perceive economic performance similarly. Scholars have referred to this paradigm frequently in economic voting literature. However, classic studies such as Hibbs' (1977) laid the foundation for exploring the role of individual economic status in influencing economic voting patterns. They observed disparities in groups' responsiveness to macroeconomic signals such as unemployment and inflation.","The influence of individual economic conditions on voting patterns has been a topic that many economic voting studies have not explored. According to Stokes' (1963) groundbreaking work, the economy is mostly considered a 'valence issue,' where all voters are likely to favor a good economy compared to a poor one. Most scholars have aimed to assign responsibility in electoral competitions for the macroeconomic performance depicted by the competing political parties. This paradigm has been prevalent throughout the economic voting literature, and many researchers have assumed that the salience of economic performance is consistent across all voters. However, some classic studies, such as the work of Hibbs (1977), have paved the way for conceptualizing the impact of individual economic conditions on economic voting patterns, which highlighted that different groups within the electorate react to the macroeconomic signals in different ways such as inflation and unemployment."
"This paragraph provides two main contributions to the current debate. Specifically, it emphasizes the importance of integrating research on economic voting with the literature on social policy preferences. It suggests that an individual's position in the labour market is crucial in determining their views on social insurance, as well as shaping economic voting patterns. At a larger level, these differences in risk exposure lead to significant variations in voting behaviour across different occupational groups. Moreover, this article conducts empirical research to test the argument, utilizing occupational unemployment data - a critical concept in the discussion of social policy preferences and the origins of the welfare state. It also puts forward a range of alternative methods for measuring the idea of 'risk exposure' to determine the robustness of its results.","This passage presents two principal arguments in the ongoing debate. Firstly, it highlights the need for a close integration of studies on economic voting and social policy preferences. The article posits that an individual's position in the labour market plays a pivotal role in shaping both their preference for social insurance and economic voting patterns. At a broader level, the resulting differences in risk exposure lead to significant variations in voting behaviour among various occupational groups. Secondly, the article conducts the first empirical assessment of this argument, using occupational unemployment data - a crucial topic in the conversation surrounding social policy preferences and the genesis of the welfare state. Additionally, a range of alternative metrics for determining the concept of 'risk exposure' are proposed to confirm the robustness of its findings.","The article offers two major contributions to the ongoing debate.

"<MASK> While it is evident that the economic voting literature needs to merge with other branches of political science, such as social policy preferences, this has been backed up by extensive scholarly studies. There is a significant imbalance in the distribution of economic risks among the electorate, resulting in variations in both preferences about redistribution and the macro-level welfare state arrangements. There are two categories of individual-level aspects that determine the exposure of individual voters to the economic cycle. The first concept explains that professional skills acquired through education and professional practices correlate positively with the degree of risk exposure. The second perspective proposes that job insecurity is the primary factor determining risk exposure, rather than employability. Furthermore, industry affiliation shapes job security through various channels.","<MASK> The results of critical articles suggest that there must be closer collaboration between the economic voting literature and other significant branches of political science, such as social policy preferences. Academic studies have established that the distribution of economic risks across the electorate is severely unequal, leading to disparities in preferences for redistribution and macro-level welfare state arrangements. There are two primary individual-level factors that determine the extent of exposure to the economic cycle of individual voters. One analysis suggests that the specificity of professional skills acquired through education and professional practices is positively related to the level of risk exposure. Workers with non-transferable skills are more vulnerable to extended unemployment in case of job loss. Another perspective proposes that job insecurity, rather than employability, is the main factor influencing risk exposure. The industry category plays a critical role in determining job security through various channels.","<MASK> The research from seminal articles indicates that the economic voting literature would benefit from closer integration with other branches of political science, particularly social policy preferences. Scholarly studies have provided ample evidence that economic risks are unevenly distributed among the electorate, leading to discrepancies in both preferences for redistribution and macro-level welfare state arrangements. Two main individual-level factors determine the voters' exposure to the economic cycle. According to one analysis, professional skills acquired through education and professional practices have a positive correlation with the level of risk exposure. Non-transferable skills make workers more vulnerable to prolonged unemployment if they lose their job. In contrast, another perspective suggests that job insecurity, not employability, is the issue affecting the risk exposure. The category of industry affiliation plays a critical role in determining job security through various channels."
"The fundamental principles of the economic voting model state that there are two primary reasons why voters may be interested in the state of the macroeconomy. Firstly, voters may value the prosperity of the economy as an end in itself, and their economic decision-making may adhere to a ""sociotropic"" trend, meaning that they will support incumbent politicians only if they have contributed to the economic well-being of the country as a whole. Secondly, voters may care about economic performance because their personal financial outcomes in the future depend partly on the overall health of the national economy. To support the argument made in this article, it is critical to assume that economic voting occurs due to ""pocketbook"" concerns about how macroeconomic performance will impact individuals' personal finances. If voters did not consider how the overall economic performance influences their financial situation, then their susceptibility to economic risk would not be a relevant factor in their economic decision-making.","According to the core principles of the economic voting model, there are two main reasons why voters may take an interest in the macroeconomic performance of a country. Firstly, voters may view economic prosperity as inherently good, and their voting decisions may reflect a ""sociotropic"" pattern where they choose incumbents who have contributed to the well-being of the country's economy as a whole. Secondly, economic performance may matter to voters because their personal financial situation in the future is partly dependent on the overall health of the national economy. This article's argument relies on the assumption that economic voting to some extent is driven by ""pocketbook"" concerns about how macroeconomic performance will impact individuals' financial situation. If voters did not consider how the overall economic performance affects their personal finances, then their susceptibility to economic risk would not factor into their decision-making about voting.","The fundamental tenets of the economic voting model suggest that voters may be interested in the macroeconomic performance of a country for two main reasons. Firstly, voters may see the prosperity of the economy as an end in itself, and their voting behavior may follow a ""sociotropic"" trend in which they support incumbents only if they have improved the economic well-being of the country as a whole (Kinder & Kiewiet 1981). Secondly, economic performance matters to voters because their future financial outcomes depend, to some extent, on the health of the national economy. For the purposes of this article's argument, it is essential to assume that economic voting occurs due to ""pocketbook"" concerns about how macroeconomic performance will impact individuals' personal finances. Without these concerns, exposure to economic risk would not play a role in economic decision-making."
"The significance of the economy and how it varies among people has been noticeably overlooked in the literature on economic voting. The present article assumes that there are two fundamental relationships between the economic salience and voting behavior. Firstly, the article suggests that voters have limited cognitive abilities in receiving and processing information on specific political issues. It is said that under various constraints, individuals tend to consider only a few of their preferences while making decisions. Secondly, the article explains that voters don't assess candidates based on their performance in all policy areas. On the contrary, they tend to focus only on those areas they find interesting. This insight is important for economic voting because although all voters may prefer a competent economic manager, some might prioritize other attributes of the candidate.","The literature on economic voting has significantly under-researched the salience of the economy and its variations across the electorate. This article makes two critical assumptions regarding the relationship between economic salience and voting behavior. Firstly, it assumes that voters face substantial cognitive limitations in the way they receive and process information on specific political issues. This is consistent with foundational work on 'bounded rationality' by Herbert Simon. Empirical research in behavioral economics and social psychology also supports this idea of individuals considering only a few preferences while making decisions under different constraints. Secondly, voters tend to evaluate candidates only on policy areas they find most relevant and interesting, rather than all policy areas. This insight is imperative for economic voting since although having a competent economic manager is a priority for most voters, some may value other candidate attributes higher.","The economic salience and its variability among the electorate have been overlooked in the literature on economic voting. The article assumes that two important aspects are associated with the relationship between economic salience and voting behavior. The first aspect is that the voters' cognitive capacity in receiving and interpreting information on political issues is constrained. Simon's work on bounded rationality supports this claim. Additionally, empirical research in behavioral economics and social psychology has demonstrated that individuals tend to consider only a few preferences when making decisions given their constraints. Secondly, voters tend to assess candidates based on their performance in policy areas relevant to them, rather than assessing them on all policy areas. Hence, economic voting depends on the attributes the voters consider meaningful, and although having a competent economic manager might be important, voters may prioritize other attributes while casting their votes."
"Economic voting has been subject to extensive research. Recent studies have aimed to refine our understanding of the connection between macroeconomic performance and voting behavior, while also considering the varying levels of economic voting across nations and individuals. Researchers have recognized the significance of responsibility attribution and the cognitive processes involved in economic voting. However, this article highlights the importance of another overlooked aspect - social policy preferences and welfare state development. Categorizing voters based on their susceptibility to economic fluctuations provides valuable insight into economic voting. The study suggests that individuals with higher job insecurity are more likely to support incumbent governments if there is good macroeconomic performance.","There has been significant research on economic voting, with recent developments aiming to enhance our understanding of the links between macroeconomic performance and voting behavior. While the importance of economic voting is recognized, there are also substantial differences seen across individuals and countries. Scholars have examined responsibility attribution and individual-level characteristics that shape the economic voting model's cognitive processes. However, this article highlights a less studied dimension - social policy preferences and welfare state development. This study suggests categorizing voters by their vulnerability to economic fluctuations can prove instrumental in providing further insights into economic voting behavior. Empirical observations indicate that voters with greater job insecurity and lower employability are more likely to condition their support for incumbents based on good macroeconomic performance.","Economic voting has received significant attention from researchers in recent years. Studies have aimed to refine our understanding of the relationship between macroeconomic performance and voting behavior, accounting for the substantial differences witnessed across countries and individuals. The significance of responsibility attribution and individual-level characteristics have also been explored in these works. However, this article introduces a less-discussed aspect - social policy preferences and welfare state development - which can offer valuable insights into economic voting behavior. The authors suggest grouping voters according to their economic vulnerability can help to shed light on the relationship between macroeconomic performance and voting behavior. Results from the study reveal that voters who face greater job insecurity and lower employability due to job loss are more likely to base their support for the incumbent government on good macroeconomic performance."
"The report presented positive results; however, the research design has limited the findings. This limitation draws potential areas for further investigation on how economic voting and economic risk are linked. The first limitation is that further studies should be conducted using actual voting data as the response variable. This study has only utilized public opinion measures, and although the analysis solely focused on respondents who intended to vote, disparities between voting intentions and actual voting choices, including those who didn't vote, remain unexamined. Secondly, the sample is narrow, consisting of only a small group of developed economies. Expanding the number of clusters in the sample can address possible methodological discrepancies in the estimation of standard errors for macro-level variables and explore interaction effects between cluster-level covariates. In addition, campaign-specific dynamics and communication strategies are key factors in election contests' economic relevance, which this study has not investigated. Finally, this report has not investigated the postulated causal mechanism.","The findings of this study are positive, but they must be understood in the context of certain limitations in the research design. These limitations suggest potential avenues for further exploration of the relationship between economic risk and economic voting. Firstly, the argument presented in this article needs to be verified using actual voting data, as the response variable used here is only a measure of public opinion. While the analysis has been restricted to those who expressed their intention to vote, this study does not account for discrepancies between such intentions and actual voting behavior or non-voting. Secondly, the sample size is limited to a small selection of advanced economies. Increasing the number of clusters in the sample could address the possible methodological shortcomings of the estimations of standard errors for macro-level variables and allow for the examination of interaction effects between cluster-level covariates. Additionally, the particular dynamics of each campaign and the strategies behind political communication play a crucial role in determining the significance of the economy in electoral contests, which were not considered in this study. Lastly, the causal mechanism that was proposed in this article has not been tested.","This study's positive results should be considered in relation to certain limitations in the research design, which can be further investigated to shed light on the connection between economic voting and economic risk. Firstly, the findings presented here must be tested using actual voting data, as the response variable utilized in this study measures public opinion instead of voting behaviors. This analysis covers respondents who intended to vote; however, the discrepancies between such intentions and the actual voting choices, including the act of not voting, have not been taken into account. Secondly, the sample size is restricted to a handful of developed economies. By increasing the number of clusters in the sample, any possible methodological flaws in the estimations of standard errors for macro-level variables can be identified, and the nature of the interaction effects between cluster-level covariates can be examined. Furthermore, the election-specific dynamics and political communication strategies, which were neglected in this study, play a crucial role in determining the economy's relevance in electoral contests.

"Figure 3 in the report presents a graphical representation that displays the differentiation between the two groups. The chart consists of two curves that predict incumbent support likelihoods based on GDP growth. One curve is solid and represents low-skill respondents. The other curve is dashed and depicts high-skill respondents. The chart shows that the curve for low-skill respondents has a steeper slope than the high-skill curve. This difference implies that macroeconomic fluctuations have a more substantial impact on low-skill respondents' support for the incumbent. During periods of bad economic performance like a -1% growth, low-skill respondents are likely to withdraw their support for the incumbent leading to a decrease in predicted incumbent support probability from 0.45 to 0.24. Meanwhile, high-skill respondents would only decrease their probability of incumbent support from 0.39 to 0.31. The chart further suggests that the divergence between the two groups is more prominent during times of economic crises than during times of economic prosperity. This finding may indicate that the two groups differ more in their willingness to condemn the incumbent for poor economic management than in their willingness to reward good economic performance.","Figure 3, included in the report, showcases a graphic representation that highlights the contrast between the two groups in question. This plot identifies two specific curves that predict the possibility of incumbent support concerning GDP growth. The chart exhibits one permanent curve that signifies the low-skill respondents and another dashed curve that characterizes the high-skill respondents. The graph suggests that the steady line belonging to low-skill respondents is steeper than the one belonging to the high-skill respondents. Hence, macroeconomic factors have a more considerable impact on the support that low-skill respondents offer to the incumbent during times of good or bad economic growth. For example, during a bad economic spectacle, such as -1% growth, the chart reveals that low-skill respondents can decrease incumbent support probability by a whopping 0.21, resulting in a reduction from 0.45 to 0.24. On the other hand, high-skill respondents would only decrease the possibility of incumbent support by 0.08, resulting in a reduction from 0.39 to 0.31. The visual representation further suggests that the rift between the two groups is more pronounced during times of economic crises compared to periods of economic prosperity. This evident disparity may indicate that the two groups differ primarily in their willingness to reprimand unproductive economic management versus their readiness to reward effective economic performance.","A graphical representation depicted in Figure 3 of the report displays the difference between the two groups by plotting two distinct curves that indicate the likelihood of incumbent support based on GDP growth. The solid curve represents the low-skill respondents, whereas the dashed curve depicts the high-skill respondents. The chart reveals that the curve for low-skill respondents is significantly steeper than the corresponding curve for high-skill respondents. This disparity suggests that macroeconomic fluctuations have a more substantial impact on low-skill respondents' support for the incumbent. For instance, during an economic downturn like a -1% growth, the chart illustrates that low-skill respondents are more likely to withdraw their support for the incumbent, leading to a decrease in the probability of incumbent support from 0.45 to 0.24. In contrast, high-skill respondents would only decrease this probability from 0.39 to 0.31. Furthermore, the chart suggests that the gap between the two groups is more pronounced during economic crises than times of economic prosperity. This outcome implies that the two groups differ primarily in their readiness to punish incumbents for bad economic governance compared to their willingness to reward them for good performance."
"The study employed models 3 to 5 to estimate the model in Equation 3, using different indicators of job insecurity. Model 3 evaluated macroeconomic growth with a dummy variable that measures the impact of unemployment on economic conditions, as unemployed respondents are in a particularly vulnerable economic condition. The estimation results in Table 2 showed that the coefficient for the interaction term is positive, although it is not statistically significant in either the simple logistic or the random effect model. Model 4 investigated the role of public sector employment as an indicator of job security, which demonstrated that the significance of public sector employment was barely significant in the random effect model and not significant in the simple regression model. In addition, the coefficient was positively signed and of modest magnitude, although it is contrary to expectations. Thus, no apparent difference was found in economic voting patterns between respondents employed in the public and private sectors. Lastly, models 5 and 5r offered empirical evidence that being a union member is indeed a vital element in economic voting behaviour.","Alternative measures of job insecurity were employed in models 3 to 5 to estimate the model in Equation 3. In Model 3, macroeconomic growth was interacted with a dummy variable measuring unemployment's impacts on economic conditions. The results of the estimation reported in Table 2 showed that the coefficient for the interaction term was positively signed, although it was not statistically significant in either the simple logistic or the random effect model. Model 4 analyzed employment in the public sector as an indicator of job security, and the findings revealed that the significance of public sector employment was almost statistically significant in the random effect model and not significant in the simple regression model. Furthermore, the coefficient was positively signed but small, which goes against the expected results. Therefore, there seems to be no apparent difference in economic voting patterns between public or private sector workers. Finally, models 5 and 5r provided empirical proof that membership in a union is a critical determinant in economic voting behaviour.","To estimate the model in Equation 3, the study used different measures of job insecurity in models 3 to 5. Model 3 examined macroeconomic growth with a dummy variable indicating whether the respondent is unemployed to assess the impact of unemployment on economic conditions. As the unemployment group is in a particularly vulnerable economic condition, we could anticipate a positive coefficient for the interaction term. The estimation presented in Table 2 showed that this was indeed the case, even though the coefficient was not significant at the 0.05 level in either the simple logistic or the random effect model. Model 4 assessed public sector employment as an indicator of job security, and the outcomes showed that the significance of public sector employment was barely significant in the random effect model (Model 4r) and not significant in the simple regression model. Additionally, contrary to expectations, the coefficient was positively signed and of modest magnitude. As a result, there does not seem to be a noticeable distinction in economic voting behaviour between respondents employed in the public or private sectors. Finally, estimates for Models 5 and 5r provided empirical evidence that being a member of a union is a crucial factor in economic voting behaviour."
"The transformation process in Hungary between 1989 and 2004 is the subject of an analysis in this paper. The primary objective of the paper is to assess and evaluate the transformation process that took place in Hungary during this period. The structure of the paper follows this goal, beginning with an investigation into the country's economic development before the fall of the communist regime, as this was the determining factor in the process that followed. The paper also briefly touches on political development, which influenced the transformation process and its outcomes significantly. The main focus of the paper is on the various critical stages in the economic transformation, with a specific discussion on privatization, among other aspects. The paper concludes with an analysis of the primary economic indicators during this period, highlighting that the transformation process achieved its main economic goal, leading to increases in the country's economic growth.

"The objective of this research is to analyze and evaluate the transformation process in Hungary. The author asserts that the chief goal of this transformation was to shift towards a market economy from the previously implemented centrally planned approach. The attainment of this objective was, in our opinion, accomplished through Hungary's accession to the EU. As a result, the research only focuses on the period ending with 2004, which serves as an indirect indication that Hungary had achieved a well-functioning market economy. However, how this state was attained is an intriguing question as there are numerous transforming countries that are still a long way from a well-functioning market economy, such as Belarus. Our view is that the second goal of the transformation process was to change the overall trend of economic development towards more specific objectives. The earlier centrally planned system was not sustainable, causing economic growth to decrease, and in fact, negligible in the 1980s. As a result, the Hungarian economy lagged behind market economies. Without increasing economic growth, changes to the economy would be meaningless. This study evaluates the progress made towards achieving this goal.","The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and analyze the transformation process in Hungary. The main objective of this transformation, as the author sees it, was to shift from a centrally planned economy to a market economy paradigm. As per our understanding, this objective was fulfilled when Hungary joined the EU. Therefore, the paper focuses on the period ending in 2004, which reinforces the fact that Hungary had achieved a well-functioning market economy (this being a condition of EU membership). However, the question remains how this state was reached, as many transforming countries are still far from reaching the state of a working market economy (e.g., Belarus). The second goal of the transformation process was to change the general trend of economic development, which we consider to be a more particular goal. The centrally planned economy was failing, with economic growth declining in the 1980s, and Hungary was falling behind the market economies. Without enhancing economic growth, any attempts to change the economy's pattern would be of no value. The paper aims to assess the progress made in attaining this objective.","The goal of this study is to analyze and evaluate the transformation process in Hungary. According to the author's viewpoint, the primary objective of this transformation was to shift the economy from the centrally planned system to a market economy. Our opinion is that this goal was generally attained with Hungary's entry to the EU. For this reason, the research considers the period leading up to 2004, which serves as indirect evidence of the existence of a well-functioning market economy (which is a requirement for EU accession). Nonetheless, it remains essential to understand how this state was attained, given that several transforming countries have failed to achieve the well-functioning market economy (such as Belarus). The second objective of the transformation process was to alter the overall trend of economic development, which was regarded as a more particular goal. The centrally planned economy was doomed for failure, with economic growth declining and nearly non-existent in the 1980s. Consequently, the Hungarian economy was struggling to keep up with the market economies. Any changes in the economy without enhancing growth would be futile. The research aims to evaluate the progress made from this perspective."
"We shall commence by describing the political progress that took place in Hungary over the long run, which had a significant influence on the state of the Hungarian economy towards the conclusion of the 1980s. The second chapter will examine this aspect in depth. Subsequently, we will shift our focus to the political developments that occurred during the transformation era, which we have identified as the period extending from 1990 to 2004 (the EU accession period). We are of the opinion that accession to the EU can be viewed as compelling evidence for the state of the Hungarian economy. The following three chapters will analyze the key economic developments, including the sequence of reforms and the privatization process. These two chapters will provide a comprehensive insight into the primary economic measures undertaken. Finally, the last chapter will summarize the economic outcomes recorded during the study period, with specific subchapters delving into critical aspects such as economic growth, inflation, the structure of the economy, unemployment, and external relationships.","Our journey shall begin by illustrating the long-term political progress that took place in Hungary and had a considerable impact on the condition of the Hungarian economy towards the end of the 1980s.

"The problems we experienced while working on the paper pertained to the data. The chief issue was the length of the consistent data series since it was challenging to acquire relevant and homogenous data that covered the entire transformation period. As a result, we had to use shorter series. We consider the data we employed to be the most suitable that were obtainable.","During the course of our work on the paper, we encountered data-related difficulties. The major problem concerned the duration of the consistent data series, as we struggled to obtain pertinent and uniform data for the entire transformation period. Consequently, we employed truncated data series. We believe that the data we used were the best available.","While we were working on the paper, data troubles were one of the issues we faced. The primary challenge was the length of the consistent data series because it was remarkably challenging to acquire relevant and homogenous data that would cover the entire transformation period. This necessitated the use of truncated data series. We believe that the data we used were the most optimal that we could find."
"To fully comprehend Hungary's history and development during the transformation process, it's essential to adopt a broader perspective. The origins of Hungary's long-term economic development can be traced back to the First World War's aftermath, when it lost a considerable portion of its land to neighbouring states. This loss of territory caused a significant impact on the Hungarian people, and the government aimed to reunite all Hungarians under one state during the interwar years. To accomplish their goal, Hungary allied itself with Nazi Germany in the 1930s.","The primary focus of the text is Hungary's development during the transformation process, but it is crucial to note the broader picture to understand the country's historical significance. Hungary's long-term economic development has roots in the aftermath of the First World War. The country lost significant portions of its land to neighboring states, and this had a significant impact on the Hungarian population, with many Hungarian minorities living in Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia. The Hungarian government aimed to reunite all Hungarians under one state during the interwar period, and to achieve this goal, Hungary became an ally of Nazi Germany in the 1930s.","The text primarily discusses Hungary's development during the transformation process, but it's necessary to take a broader perspective to gain a better understanding of the country. The roots of Hungary's long-term economic development lie in the aftermath of the First World War, a crucial event in Hungarian history. Following the war, Hungary experienced significant territorial losses to neighboring countries, resulting in the displacement of many Hungarian minorities into Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania. The Hungarian government aimed to reunite these people under one state during the interwar period, which led to the country becoming an ally of fascist Germany in the 1930s."
"The political situation in Hungary became increasingly relaxed over time, culminating in the establishment of an opposition party during the mid-1980s. Following negotiations that took place in 1989, significant changes were made to the constitution in favor of democracy, human rights, market economy, and the prevention of any one party ruling in the parliament. This milestone was reached on October 23, 1989, marking a new era of democratic government for Hungary. As a result, the country held genuine democratic elections in March 1990, and successfully avoided any form of unrepresentative government.","Gradual political relaxation took place in Hungary, and by the mid-1980s, opposition parties began to emerge. In 1989, negotiations occurred at the round table, leading to crucial alterations to the constitution that would ensure that Hungary would transition to a democratic government that upholds human rights, a market-oriented economy, and disallows any single political party from obtaining total dominance. This constitutional change was ratified on October 23, 1989, and marked the beginning of Hungary's new democratic era. Without the formation of a unity government or pseudo-democracy, Hungary had its first truly democratic election in March 1990.","The political climate in Hungary became more relaxed over time, which resulted in the formation of an opposition party by the mid-1980s. Talks were held at the round table in 1989, and the subsequent constitutional amendments cemented the transition to a democratic system based on human rights, market economics, and a formal ban on any single-party rule, even when the party has a majority in parliament. On October 23, 1989, this constitutional change was officially approved, heralding a new democratic era for Hungary. As a direct result, free and fair elections were held in March 1990, without resorting to pseudo-democracy or a government of national unity."
"The Hungarian economy's growth was immediately affected by political developments. The country adopted a centrally planned system after World War II, which had certain differences from other systems in the region but nonetheless had similar underpinnings. While the Hungarian system wasn't as harsh as Czechoslovakia's, the introduction of reforms from 1968 onwards led to even greater divergence between the two systems.","Political changes had an immediate effect on the development of the Hungarian economy. Following World War II, the country implemented a centrally planned system that, though it had different features from other systems in the region, shared a similar foundation. The Hungarian system was generally less strict than Czechoslovakia's system, but as reforms began to be implemented after 1968, the differences between the two systems became more pronounced.","The development of the Hungarian economy was immediately influenced by political changes.

"Hungary became the pioneering country in Central Europe to adopt a value added tax system as it was incorporated in 1988. Also, they had liberalized 63% of all prices by 1989. The forint was prone to continuous reductions in value, declining from 45.8 to USD in 1986 to 63.2 in 1990, according to Vintrová (1992).","Hungary was the leader in Central Europe in including value-added tax in the tax system, which happened in 1988. Furthermore, almost two-thirds of prices were liberalized by 1989. The forint experienced consistent devaluation, dipping from 45.8 to USD in 1986 to 63.2 in 1990 (Vintrová, 1992).","In 1988, Hungary emerged as the first country in Central Europe to incorporate value-added tax into the tax system. The liberalization of about 63% of all prices had already occurred by 1989. Additionally, there were persistent devaluations of the forint, with its value decreasing from 45.8 to USD in 1986 to 63.2 in 1990, as documented by Vintrová (1992)."
"The private sector's contribution to the national product was 3% as stated by Bethkenhagen (1989) in 1970. According to Holman (2000), it had increased to more than 25% by 1989, and two-thirds of Hungarians had a source of income from private activities along with their primary job in a state company or cooperative. While this is much higher than Czechoslovakia's numbers, it still isn't enough to establish a fully functional market economy.","In 1970, the private sector made up just 3% of the national product according to Bethkenhagen (1989). However, by 1989, that number had risen significantly to over 25%, as reported by Holman (2000). As many as two-thirds of Hungarians had a secondary income from private activities, in addition to their primary employment at a state company or cooperative. Although these figures were significantly higher than those of Czechoslovakia, they still fell short of a robust market economy.","According to Bethkenhagen's (1989) findings, the private sector only accounted for 3% of the national product in 1970. However, by 1989, the private sector had grown to create over one quarter of the national product, as per Holman's (2000) research. Additionally, nearly two-thirds of Hungarians had an extra source of income from private activities while working in a state company or a cooperative. Although these figures were several times higher in comparison to Czechoslovakia, they still did not reflect a fully developed market economy."
"The communist reign in Hungary saw the economy experiencing significant fluctuations in growth, which were more pronounced than in Czechoslovakia. While the 1950s saw strong growth, subsequent decades were marked by a decline in the economy's growth that plummeted to very low levels in the 1980s. Despite introducing economic reforms, these changes did not translate into improvement in economic growth trends but instead led to declining results. A clear depiction of this trend is shown in a figure provided in the text.","The impact of the communist reign is evident in the Hungarian economy, which witnessed significant fluctuations in growth - more than its Czechoslovakian counterpart. Strong growth was experienced in the 1950s, but subsequent decades saw a decline that resulted in  very low growth rates during the 1980s. Despite the introduction of economic reforms, the trends of economic growth remained unchanged, and results continued to worsen rather than improve.

"The initial free elections occurred in March/April of 1990, as we previously mentioned. A post-communist government, led by Jozsef Antall (1932-1993), was established. The administration was centred around Christian and national parties and skewed to the right. Its stability was provided by a solid majority of 60% in Parliament. One of its accomplishments was the withdrawal of Soviet forces from Hungary during 1991. Similarly, an association agreement with the European Community was finalised that year.","As previously mentioned, March/April of 1990 saw the first free elections take place. Following this, Jozsef Antall (1932-1993) formed the initial post-communist government. This government was based on Christian and national parties, and was predominantly right-wing. Its position was strengthened by the fact that it had a substantial 60% majority in the parliament. One of their significant achievements was the removal of Soviet troops from Hungary during 1991. Additionally, an association agreement was signed with the European Community that same year.","Earlier, we mentioned that the first free elections were held in March/April of 1990.

"In 1994, the left wing party called MSZP, which has origins in post-communism, won the elections with a vast majority. However, the tough economic conditions forced them to implement strict economic measures, which will be discussed in detail later. After the 1998 elections, a right wing coalition was established with Fidesz as the main party. During their tenure, Hungary joined NATO. Although Fidesz won the 2002 elections as well, they were powerless to form a government, and a coalition of left wing parties assumed power instead.","Following the elections in 1994, the MSZP, a post-communist left wing party, emerged victorious with a huge majority. Owing to the economic situation of the country, they had to introduce some robust economic policies, which will be explained later. The 1998 elections resulted in a right wing government coalition, led by the Fidesz party. Under their leadership, Hungary became a member of NATO. Fidesz won the next elections in 2002, but they weren't able to form a government as left wing parties toppled them.","In 1994, the MSZP, a left wing party originated from post-communism, claimed a landslide victory in the general elections.

Fidesz triumphed again in the 2002 elections but failed to form a government, which was instead established by a coalition of left wing parties."
"Hungary maintained democratic principles throughout the entire period and became part of the European Union in 2004. However, there has been a prolonged discontent with Hungary's transformation process and overall quality of life. The results of a 2006 survey illustrate this dissatisfaction, which cannot be reasonably explained. One possible explanation is the high hopes Hungarians had in the late 1980s and their general contentment with the semi-capitalist system of goulash communism.","Throughout the entire period, Hungary remained committed to democratic principles and was admitted into the European Union in 2004. However, there has been a persistent dissatisfaction with the country's transformation process and overall quality of life.

"The discussion of reforms during the transformation period in Hungary was similar to what was happening in other countries. However, one distinctive feature of Hungary was that its communist party started implementing reforms before the fall of the regime, which led many Hungarians to believe that it was unnecessary to initiate radical reforms. Rather, they believed that slower reforms could bring the same outcomes with lower costs. Nevertheless, advocates of shock therapy were not convinced that the government possessed the capacity to establish a market economy. The initial stage of the Hungarian transformation is often regarded as gradualist. Nonetheless, there remains an ongoing debate about what constitutes gradualism. Several Hungarian measures, especially the bankruptcy law, were perceived as being exceedingly radical. In the second subchapter, the focus is on the reforms that transpired in the mid-1990s, while the third subchapter concentrates on the period after the turn of the century.","Hungary's discussion of reforms during the transformation period was similar to what was happening in other nations. The unique feature that set Hungary apart was that the communist party had already implemented reforms before the fall of the regime. As a result, Hungarians believed that radical reforms were not necessary, and that slower reforms could achieve similar results with less cost. However, proponents of shock therapy distrusted the government's ability to establish a market economy. Consequently, the first phase of Hungary's transformation is often described as gradualist, though there is some controversy over what gradualism means. Some measures, such as the bankruptcy law, were considered highly radical. The second subchapter details the reforms that occurred in the mid-1990s, while the third subchapter focuses on the period after the turn of the century.","Hungary's approach to reforms during the transformation period was not dissimilar to what was happening in other countries.

"The Hungarian economy faced macroeconomic imbalances that were previously mentioned. According to Laki (1993), the Antall government's key objectives were to maintain the country's creditworthiness, reduce inflation, and manage the growing public deficit. The most complex task was to reduce the public deficit after the fall of the communist regime since state income declined while there were efforts to lower expenditures. Moreover, the government took on the responsibility of public service-providing late-state companies, which contributed to an increase in expenditure (Allen, Hass, 2001).","As stated earlier, the Hungarian economy was affected by macroeconomic imbalances. Laki (1993) highlighted that the Antall government was tasked with three main objectives, which were to uphold the country's creditworthiness, mitigate inflation, and address the increasing public deficit. The most arduous challenge was to tackle the public deficit after the fall of the communist regime, given the decrease in state income and the difficulty of reducing expenses simultaneously. Furthermore, the government assumed responsibility for late-stated companies that provided social services, leading to higher spending (Allen, Hass, 2001).","Macro imbalance was identified as one of the issues plaguing the Hungarian economy as mentioned previously. Laki (1993) outlined three major tasks for the Antall government, which were to maintain the country's creditworthiness, control inflation, and manage the public deficit, the latter being the most difficult to address after the fall of the communist regime. The state's revenue decreased, while expenses remained high, making it challenging to reduce the public deficit. Additionally, the government frequently took over the responsibility of late state companies providing social services, incurring further spending (Allen, Hass, 2001)."
"The Hungarian government decided to implement reforms in both the business and financial sectors while simultaneously making efforts to improve the country's legal system, privatize state-owned enterprises, and strengthen antitrust policies. However, their approach to bankruptcy legislation was highly questionable as the new code enacted in 1992 was quite austere. If a company was not able to pay off its debts within 90 days, it was required to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. The law remained in effect for 18 months which led to the bankruptcy of 5,000 subjects who collectively contributed to 10% of Hungary's GDP. Although this bankruptcy proceeding served as a method of privatization, it had unintended negative repercussions for the banks as the number of classified credits continued to rise. By comparison, the Czech Republic's bankruptcy legislation was weaker during the same period; the first law was approved only in 1993 and did not apply to companies yet to be privatized.","The Hungarian government adopted reforms in the business and financial sectors while simultaneously making efforts to enhance the legal system, privatization processes, antitrust laws, and bankruptcy laws, which is highly doubtful considering the implementation of bankruptcy legislation. They enacted a strict new code in 1992, and if a company could not pay off its debts within 90 days, it had to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. After 18 months, the new code led to the bankruptcy of 5,000 subjects that contributed to approximately 10% of Hungary's GDP. Interestingly, this bankruptcy procedure served as a method of privatization since nearly 500 prominent bankrupt companies were shifted to private ownership. This move had an unwanted impact on banks due to the increase in classified credits. In comparison, the Czech Republic's bankruptcy legislation was relatively weak during the same period; they approved their first law only in 1993, which did not apply to companies seeking privatization.","Despite enacting reforms in the business and financial sectors concurrently with improvements to the legal system, privatization measures, and antitrust policies, the approach to bankruptcy legislation taken by the Hungarian government was questionable. In 1992, a stringent new code was introduced, requiring companies unable to pay their debts within 90 days to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. After 18 months, 5,000 entities were declared bankrupt, which represented around 10% of the country's GDP. This bankruptcy process functioned simultaneously as a method of privatization, resulting in the transfer of nearly 500 large bankrupt companies to private ownership. Unfortunately, the growth in classified credits had unintended negative consequences for affected banks. In comparison, the Czech Republic's bankruptcy legislation remained relatively weak during the same period, with the first law not approved until 1993 and not applied to companies scheduled for privatization."
"Hungary's economic progress in the given period was unfavorable. Despite aiming for a gradual reform approach, it was unable to avoid the recession caused by transformation. Hungary underwent a similar or even more severe decline than other nations in Central Europe resulting in a high unemployment rate rate. Unlike in other countries, inflation did not show a significant increase following the price liberalization; however, it remained consistently higher. Despite this, Hungary experienced a relatively high inflow of foreign capital, which was linked to the previous liberalization, and foreign investors being well-informed about Hungary. In contrast, Hungary experienced a current account deficit.","During the indicated period, Hungary's economic outcomes were not positive. Despite pursuing a gradual reform plan, it failed to evade a recession that followed the transformation. Hungary suffered a decline that was comparable, if not worse than what other Central European countries experienced, resulting in relatively high unemployment. While there was no sudden increase in inflation after the price liberalization, the inflation rate remained consistently high. As a positive aspect, Hungary received a substantial amount of foreign investment, thanks to the previous liberalization and foreign investors' familiarity with Hungary's situation. Nonetheless, Hungary faced a current account deficit.","Hungary's economic performance during the given period was negative.

Nonetheless, Hungary experienced a significant inflow of foreign capital, which was attributed to the previous liberalization, making foreign investors familiar with the situation in Hungary. On the other hand, Hungary registered a deficit in its current account."
"The government implemented these steps with the goal of reducing public finance and trade balance deficits while promoting competition in the economy. However, these measures resulted in harsh consequences such as a 10% decline in government spending as a percentage of GDP in 1995, and real wages decreasing by 12% then by 4% the next year. Additionally, the economy grew at a slower pace with a growth rate of only 1% in both 1995 and 1996. Despite this, there were also positive outcomes such as the reduction of trade deficit between 1994 and 1996 and a decrease in government deficit (excluding privatization income) from 8.4% to 3% in the same period. The average deficit was relatively high at 5.5% of GDP between 1990 and 2004, making it worse than other Central European countries. The following figure presents an overview of public finance developments within the first decade.","The government implemented these measures with the aim of reducing both trade balance and public finance deficits, while simultaneously increasing competition in the economy.

"The application of the Bokros package resulted in positive economic development; however, this was short-lived, and Hungary experienced several difficulties at the start of the new century. The government's expenditures were held responsible for infamous fiscal problems, with public sector wages increasing by a staggering 12-13% in 2002. Additionally, there was a gradual rise in public finance deficit, indicating further instability. One of the reasons for the trade imbalance was a widespread slowdown of European economies, but the primary factor was the rise in wages that reduced competitiveness. The statements were made by Gabrisch and H?lscher in 2006.","Following the introduction of the Bokros package, there was a general consensus that the economic development of Hungary had improved, but unfortunately, it was short-lived. As the new century began, the Hungarian government faced a growing number of challenges in the fiscal field, largely due to its own expenses. In 2002, public sector wages rose between 12-13%, according to Gabrisch and H?lscher, causing a significant increase in public finance deficits that can be seen in the previous chart. Trade deficits also increased due to declining competitiveness, primarily resulting from high wage growth, despite being partly caused by the slow-down of European economies.","Although the Bokros package initially resulted in positive economic development, Hungary's prosperity period was short-lived. In the early 2000s, Hungary was faced with growing issues, primarily originating from the government's expenditure in the fiscal field.

Trade was another area of significant instability, as the trade deficit rose to between 6-8% of the GDP, in part due to the economic slowdown in Europe, but largely due to declining competitiveness caused by wage growth."
"In response to lasting inflation pressures, the central bank implemented a monetary restriction, which included a widening of the fluctuation band in May 2001. The implementation of the inflation targeting system and full convertibility of the currency followed in the summer of that year. In October, the crawling peg was abandoned, and the central parity of the forint was fixed. While the central bank shifted its focus to inflation targeting, it continued to maintain the central parity and fluctuation zone. This meant using interest rates as a tool to control both inflation and exchange rates, which was made challenging by the free movement of capital. Despite declining inflation and lower pressure on the nominal exchange rate, the Hungarian authorities decided to fix the currency.","To address lasting inflation pressures, the central bank decided to implement a monetary restriction.

In October, the crawling peg was abandoned, and the central parity of the forint was fixed. Despite shifting its emphasis to inflation targeting, the central bank still maintained the central parity and fluctuation zone. As a result, it used interest rates as a tool to manage both inflation and exchange rates, which became even more challenging due to the free movement of capital.

"The negative impact of increased inflation was the growth of foreign currency indebtedness, leading to a problematic trend in subsequent years. This phenomenon was particularly alarming for households that frequently acquired loans in Swiss francs or euros. The progress and increase of this type of borrowing can be witnessed in the graph below. The primary cause of this trend was the unfavorable difference between interest rates in Hungary and developed nations, in addition to the rising inflation rate. However, this borrowing pattern became problematic only if the exchange rate was stable or increasing, creating a dangerous situation.","As previously mentioned, the high inflation rate generated a pessimistic outcome of rising indebtedness in foreign currencies, which continued to exacerbate over the following years. This pattern was alarming, particularly for households that frequently secured mortgages in Swiss francs or euros. The following chart showcases the proportion and enlargement of this category of debt. This occurrence was predominantly caused due to a higher inflation rate and the fact that the interest rates in Hungary were consistently greater than those in developed nations. This borrowing trend can be fatal only if the exchange rate remains stable or increases, creating a hazardous condition.","The problem with soaring inflation was a detrimental trend of increasing indebtedness in foreign currencies, which persisted in subsequent years. This situation had severe implications, particularly for households that frequently obtained mortgages in Swiss francs or euros.

This harmful borrowing trend could only ensue issues under the condition that the exchange rate stabilized or appreciated, posing a dangerous situation."
"The trends of high government deficits discussed in Figure 2 did not translate into an increase in government debt during the period at hand, as indicated by the subsequent graph.

"The role of state company managers differed greatly between the central European countries at the start of their transformation process. In Hungary, these managers were more widely accepted compared to in Czechoslovakia, where they were viewed as high-ranking communists. This disparity allowed Hungarian managers to gain control of thousands of companies by the late 1980s, leading to what is now known as ""spontaneous privatization.""","At the outset of the transformation process, there were notable distinctions between the central European countries. The primary difference related to ownership and the role of state company managers.

"The survey's findings revealed the public's stance on privatization was not straightforward. Hungary had minimal support for restitutions (re-privatization) and was among the highest in Eastern Europe with regards to resistance to privatization. Despite this, respondents exhibited strong support for selling companies at the highest price offered. A survey conducted in 1991 by Laki indicated that whilst 34% of respondents opposed privatization, a majority of 55-60% were against privatizing their own company. The poll also indicated growing resentment towards foreign investment and the return of lands to previous owners.","The public's view on privatization was not black and white according to the results of the survey. Hungary showed little support for restitutions (re-privatization) and was one of the Eastern European countries with the highest resistance to privatization as a whole. Notwithstanding this, the findings also demonstrated the populace's inclination to sell businesses at the highest price attainable. A report by Laki from the early 1990s suggested that while 34% of respondents opposed privatization, a significant 55-60% opposed privatizing their own company. In addition, respondents showed a strong aversion to foreign investment and the return of land to previous proprietors.","The survey showed that the public's attitude towards privatization was not clear-cut.

Furthermore, the respondents expressed significant disapproval of foreign investment and the restitution of property to its previous owners."
"The Hungarian government passed a law in 1988 that allowed the state companies to become joint-stock companies. This allowed the management to gain control of the companies, and the insiders continued to have a significant role in the privatization process in the following decade. The government was unable to sell or retain a company without the approval of insiders, according to Earle and Estrin (1996). However, this power was often abused by management, resulting in scandals and embezzlement. As a result, the public's perception of this form of privatization was negative, leading to a slowdown in the entire privatization process (Srholec, 2001).","Back in 1988, Hungary passed an act that made it possible for state-owned companies to become joint-stock companies, which was a momentous occasion. This allowed the management to take control of the companies, and the insiders continued to dominate the early stages of the privatization process during the next decade. According to Earle and Estrin (1996), the government could not sell a company to outsiders or retain full ownership without the insiders' consent. However, management often took advantage of their power, resulting in scandals and embezzlement, and this led to the public turning against this form of privatization. As a consequence, the privatization process slowed down significantly, as highlighted by Srholec (2001).","In Hungary, there was a turning point in the privatization process when the state companies were transformed into joint-stock companies by the 1988 act. This gave the management the power to take over the companies, and during the initial stages of the following decade, insiders continued to play a dominant role in the privatization process. The government was unable to sell a company to external parties or retain full ownership without the approval of insiders, as noted by Earle and Estrin (1996). However, management's power was often misused, leading to scandals and embezzlement, which caused the public to be against this form of privatization. As a result, the privatization process slowed down significantly, as highlighted by Srholec (2001)."
"In 1990, the state Property Fund (SPA) was set up to oversee the privatization process in Ukraine. SPA's responsibilities included supervising the sale of state-owned companies. According to Earle and Estrin (1996), SPA possibly prevented further abuse of power by having to approve all sales. By controlling almost 2,000 state-owned businesses, primarily in industry and agriculture, SPA played a significant role in establishing an institutional environment.","During the year 1990, the state Property Fund (SPA) was established in Ukraine to manage the country's privatization program. SPA was designated as the primary organization for handling privatization and had control over nearly 2,000 state-owned companies, with the majority being in industrial and agricultural sectors. Earle and Estrin (1996) suggest that SPA's role in approving sales may have prevented more significant abuse of the state's resources. SPA's formation in 1990 helped create an institutional environment that facilitated the country's privatization process.","The Ukrainian government established the state Property Fund (SPA) in 1990 to oversee the privatization process in the country. With control over nearly 2,000 state-owned companies, primarily in industry and agriculture, SPA played a significant role in the privatization program.

SPA's establishment in 1990 also helped create an institutional environment that facilitated the country's privatization process."
"The government initiated small-scale privatization concurrently. The introduction of the first program, pre-privatization, began in May 1990, and its primary aim was to prevent uncontrolled privatization, particularly in the retail sector. During the years between 1991 and 1993, an estimated 10,000 small shops and restaurants were sold or leased through auction. Significantly, the majority of the property was given to the employees of the respective shops. The following table presents an overview of the modifications in terms of property ownership.","In the meantime, the government initiated the process of small-scale privatization. The first program, dubbed as pre-privatization, was launched in May 1990 and especially aimed at the retail sector with a mission to halt impulsive privatization. Between 1991 and 1993, approximately 10,000 units, primarily comprising small shops and restaurants, were either sold or leased through auctions. A key aspect of this method of privatization was that the employees of the respective shops received the large share of the property. The subsequent table provides an overview of the changes in property ownership.","In the meantime, the small privatization process was initiated by the government. The first program, known as pre-privatization, was launched in May 1990 in the retail sector with the aim of curbing uncontrollable privatization. Between 1991 and 1993, around 10,000 units, comprising mainly small shops and restaurants, were sold or leased via auctions. The way of privatization involved giving the employees of the concerned shops the maximum share of the property. The alterations in property ownership can be seen in the table below."
"The SPA divested 75% of its ownership until mid-1995, which only accounted for 35% of state property. Certain industries like gas distribution, railways, airlines, telecommunication, banks, and chemical companies were still government-owned. However, the Bokros package changed things. The government needed to reduce the fiscal deficits, so it initiated an intensification of the privatization process, where it planned to sell all state-owned properties, except railways, post office, and national parks. Approximately HUF 1.3 trillion of the state ownership, which was HUF 1.6 trillion, was earmarked for privatization, resulting in foreign investors flooding the country. The government sold properties worth HUF 790 billion, which helped reduce the debt from 86% of GDP in 1995 to 60% in 1998.","The SPA sold 75% of its ownership by mid-1995, equivalent to only 35% of state property. However, the government didn't relinquish ownership of specific industries, including gas distribution, railways, airlines, telecommunication, banks, and chemical companies. Things changed with the Bokros package, which aimed to reduce fiscal deficits by selling off all state-owned properties except the railways, post office, and national parks. The government planned to privatize around HUF 1.3 trillion out of its overall state ownership of HUF 1.6 trillion, selling properties directly to foreign investors. This approach generated a considerable inflow of foreign direct investment, ultimately helping the government reduce its debt from 86% of GDP in 1995 to 60% in 1998.","Until mid-1995, SPA had divested 75% of its ownership, which accounted for just 35% of state property. Several industries, including gas distribution, railways, airlines, telecommunication, banks, and chemical companies, had still retained government ownership. However, the need for urgent reduction of fiscal deficits prompted the government to implement the Bokros package, which aimed to intensify the privatization process by selling off all state-owned properties except the railways, post office, and national parks. About HUF 1.3 trillion of the overall state ownership, which was HUF 1.6 trillion, was marked for privatization, with a typical method of direct sales to foreign investors, resulting in a vast inflow of foreign direct investment into Hungary. By the end of 1997, the government sold off properties amounting to HUF 790 billion, and its debt had decreased from 86% of GDP in 1995 to 60% in 1998."
"The diagram illustrates the economic progress in Hungary, showing that like many other central European nations, it experienced a recession during the transformation period. Although the gradual reforms were unable to prevent the economic decline, there was still a noticeable deceleration in growth after 1995. Nevertheless, the general trajectory is optimistic, and a comparison of the HP filter results during the socialist era and those post-1990 reveals Hungary's ability to achieve a 3 to 4 percent growth rate after overcoming the transformational recession.","The given figure depicts Hungary's economic growth. Like other central European countries, Hungary faced a transformational recession, and the gradualist approach to reform failed to avoid the downturn, resulting in a visible slowdown post-1995. Despite this, the general trend is upbeat.

"The rate of unemployment in Hungary rose during the early stages of transformation, despite implementing a more gradual approach. It peaked at 12%, before experiencing a slow decline. However, in the Czech Republic, unemployment remained at a minimum until 1997 when it grew due to economic and currency crises. By this time, Hungary had already been steadily reducing its unemployment rate. It is worth noting that both countries had low unemployment rates compared to other post-communist countries, with Poland being an example. That being said, there was a significant decrease in employment in Hungary that influenced the data.","Despite adopting a more gradual approach, Hungary still experienced an increase in unemployment during the early period of transformation. The rate reached its peak at around 12% before gradually declining. On the other hand, the unemployment rate in the Czech Republic remained minimal until 1997 when economic crises led to a rise in its rate. However, during this time, Hungary had already stabilized and started reducing its unemployment rate. It is to be noted that while both countries had comparably low unemployment rates compared to other post-communist countries, the deep decline in employment in Hungary had a significant impact on the figures.","Hungary, despite implementing a more gradual approach, still experienced an increase in unemployment during the initial stages of transformation.

"The current economic literacy tests place a heavy emphasis on theory and largely overlook the actual economy. This research is focused on evaluating how successful we are in imparting empirical knowledge to students. While most people recognize that economic literacy is an admirable objective and current literacy instruction seeks to teach students how to think like economists, the authors of the study do not intend to criticize the present approach to economic literacy. Instead, they want to initiate a dialogue within the discipline about the importance of introducing students to some fundamental economic facts.

"Economic literacy based on facts and impartiality enables students to comprehend the economic environment they live in. This understanding serves as a basis for students to make informed decisions regarding future economic projections and normative guidance regarding the right direction for their economy. Instructors play a dual role in the classroom-they must present students with distinct economic models to indicate how the economy operates and also provide them with insight into the most basic and factual economic variables so that they can properly use these models. This paper highlights only the second role, which is to inform students of factual information about economic variables, which will enable them to make better-informed decisions regarding economic issues. The issue of which models should be taught is not addressed in this text.","Objective economics presents learners with factual data about their economy, allowing them to understand its realities. This foundation provides students with the ability to make educated decisions regarding the future direction of their economy while also giving them the power to make normative assumptions regarding the direction it ought to be heading. Instructors must double up as disseminators of different economic models to explain how the economy works, as well as providers of essential, factual data on economic variables, equipping students with the knowledge they will need to use the models properly. This paper mainly emphasizes the latter role, which is to give students unbiased and factual information about real economic variables. By doing this, students can make more informed decisions regarding economic issues. The question of which models to teach is beyond the scope of this work.","The principles of objective economics are based on factual information, providing students with a thorough understanding of the economy around them.

"There has been a discussion about the appropriateness of defining literacy in this direction. In 2002, a paper was presented by Hansen, Salemi, and Siegfried on potential ways to reorder college principle classes, with the goal of improving literacy attainment. They argued that the current introduction courses with their focus on technical literacy are unhelpful to most students in the classes who will not take further training in economics. Hansen et al. cited a study indicating that college economics course-takers scored 9 on a 15-point survey, while high-school economics course takers scored an 8, and those with no economics background scored a 7.

"The claim that those advocating for ""practicing economics"" have a genuine desire to improve student comprehension seems to be plausible. However, it is unclear what this statement really means. Does it require teaching students to think in utility maximization terms? If this is the case, then it implies that utility maximization is not innate and necessitates instruction. Alternatively, does it signify simply introducing students to the most effective models currently available without providing them with a good grasp of authentic economic variables? As discussed earlier, while it is crucial to introduce students to these models, neglecting to provide them with a basic understanding of real financial factors will have future negative consequences. This is akin to assisting students in creating a car but failing to instruct them on fueling the car. Hence, due to the persuasive influence of basic economic analysis, we have an obligation to offer our students with the information that underpins these tools and to guide them on how to effectively apply the knowledge to whichever models they learn.","It seems reasonable to assume that individuals pushing for the idea of ""practicing economics"" have a sincere desire to enhance student understanding. But, it begs the question, what does this statement precisely entail? Does it involve training students to think in terms of maximizing utility? If this is the case, then it means that the concept of utility maximization is not instinctive but rather necessitates education. Or does it refer to merely introducing our learners to the best models available and leaving it at that? However, as stated in the opening paragraph, introducing models to students is crucial, but failing to impart a basic understanding of genuine economic variables leads to inevitable shortcomings. It's similar to helping students build a car without informing them that gasoline is required to make the car work. Given the rhetoric of basic economic analysis, it appears necessary to provide our students with the foundation on which these models are based and to teach them how to soundly apply this foundation to whichever models they study.","It is reasonable to suggest that those advocating for ""practicing economics"" genuinely desire to enhance student comprehension, but what does this statement entail?

"The selection of information that falls under the ""economics"" category is critical to defining the scope of the field. This may be why there is now less emphasis on teaching fact-based economics. Although most economists agree that macro topics such as GDP, inflation, unemployment, and GDP per person are essential, some may also include poverty, income distribution, interest rates, or banking. Many lecturers are inclined to teach topics aligned with their interests. However, the pertinent question is whether we provide the students with accurate empirical statistics and reliable information on significant economic matters.","The choice of which facts to incorporate into the realm of economics is crucial in determining the extent of what is considered a part of the field. It is plausible that this might be why fact-based economic instruction is not given the same emphasis as before. Most economists agree that macroeconomic subjects like GDP, inflation, unemployment, and GDP per capita are central issues. However, there are economists who also focus on poverty, changes in income distribution over time, and the importance of interest rates and banking. Still, others might cover other topics, such as how tax systems and social security work. While economists tend to shape their curriculum according to their interests, it is important to consider if students are being provided with detailed and accurate empirical data on major economic issues.","It is important to carefully choose which facts are within the scope of economics as it shapes the definition of the field. One possibility is that this has resulted in decreased emphasis on fact-based economic instruction. Most economists agree that macro topics like GDP, inflation, unemployment, and GDP per capita are important, whereas others may choose to focus on poverty or changes in income distribution over time. Additionally, interest rates and banking systems or topics related to the functioning of tax systems and social security may also be covered. Depending on their interests, most economists tend to prioritize certain topics over others. However, it is crucial to consider whether the students are receiving accurate information with empirical evidence on the most significant economic issues."
"A team of researchers is conducting a study to gauge the understanding of actual economic variables among individuals in the economy. They have an ongoing project and are continuously improving their methods and procedures as they proceed.

"according to the students' responses, an average income of $20,056,314 was believed to be needed to be in the top 5%, while $887,906 was required to be in the top 20%.

"Based on the formal training of the respondents, we can analyze their responses and obtain some interesting results once again.

"The aim of this paper is to analyze the relationship between economic liberty, foreign direct investment (FDI), and economic development across a sample of 85 countries. Utilizing the generalized method-of-moment system estimator, our findings indicate that FDI does not have an immediate (positive) impact on output growth.

"The impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on growth has been a highly debated topic in the economic literature. There is increasing interest in this area of research, especially with policymakers' emphasis on attracting more FDI inflows. Many countries, including developing ones, have lifted restrictions on foreign capital flows since the 1980s, leading to a significant increase in global FDI inflows. The growth rate of world FDIs has exceeded not only that of world trade but also GDP over the past few decades (UNCTAD, 2001). Policymakers believe that FDI has several advantages, including productivity gains, transfers of technology, introduction of new processes and management techniques, technical know-how within the local market, employee training, and international production networks. Additionally, FDI is less volatile than other forms of capital, making it less disruptive.","The impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic growth is a much-discussed subject in economics.

Consequently, global FDI inflows have risen considerably from $57 billion in 1982 to $1271 billion in 2000. Over the past few decades, the growth rate of world FDIs has outpaced the growth rates of both world trade and GDP (UNCTAD, 2001).

"This article aims to better comprehend the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth through the lens of institutions. Recent literature has suggested that economic freedom plays a crucial role in facilitating FDI spillovers, in which multinational corporations transfer technology and knowledge to host countries. The lack of economic freedom can limit the ability of firms (or countries) to absorb and internalize new knowledge and  technologies, ultimately hindering economic growth. Despite the significance of economic freedom, previous studies have predominantly emphasized its direct impact on economic growth. Therefore, this paper contributes to the literature by examining the role of economic freedom in generating wealth.","The objective of this study is to gain a better understanding of the FDI-growth nexus by focusing on institutions. Recent research has emphasized the importance of economic freedom in facilitating FDI spillovers, which is when multinational corporations (MNCs) transfer knowledge and technology to the host country.

"In this article, we aim to establish a potential link between growth and economic freedom by utilizing the economic freedom index (EF) provided by the Fraser Institute. This index measures institutional quality and provides insight into the characteristics of an environment that promotes prosperity. The index components make us anticipate that countries with higher levels of economic freedom will have greater absorptive capacity and, therefore, gain more benefits from FDI spillovers. Economic professionals generally agree that less regulation would improve economic progress. An open and competitive market offers more opportunities for entrepreneurs to test out new ideas and encourages businesses to participate in risky ventures like FDI-related activities to seek higher returns. However, an extensively regulated market will not function correctly, which leads to poor allocation of resources. For instance, with heavy regulations, FDI-related activities will be affected as businesses require outside sources for funding to adopt new technology.

"Factors such as tax incentives, subsidies, and policies that stimulate Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) are designed to encourage FDI because of the expectation that FDI will benefit the recipient country considerably. Multinational Corporations (MNCs) are linked to advanced technologies, patents, trade secrets, brand names, management techniques, and marketing strategies, and they are among the most technologically advanced firms that invest heavily in Research and Development (R&D). Additionally, MNCs recruit a high number of technical and professional employees. FDIs offer immediate access to cutting-edge technology, which can benefit not just those who receive the foreign investment but also other local firms. Foreign direct investments are also known to balance payment deficits, result in job creation, provide training to managers and workers, and increase exports by setting up assembly plants and facilitating local firms to enter international markets.","In order to tap into the significant benefits Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can bring, countries often offer tax incentives, subsidies, and policies that encourage its adoption. The assumption is that Multinational Corporations (MNCs) are associated with advanced technologies, patents, trade secrets, brand names, management techniques, and marketing strategies that will transfer to the recipient countries. Furthermore, MNCs invest heavily in research and development (R&D), making them among the most technologically advanced companies globally, and they hire a sizeable workforce of skilled professionals. By opening the door to FDIs, individual countries gain sudden exposure to cutting-edge technology, which can benefit not only the host nation but also other companies operating there. Foreign direct investment can increase a host nation's capital stock, generating similar growth effects to local investment and also allows for the creation of jobs and management training of employees. In addition, export-oriented FDIs can contribute significantly to exports by establishing assembly plants and facilitating local firms' access to international markets.","Tax incentives, subsidies, and policies aimed at stimulating foreign direct investment (FDI) are used as a means of accessing the significant benefits FDI can bring to receiving countries. Multinational corporations (MNCs) are characterized by their possession of advanced technologies, patents, trade secrets, brand names, management techniques, and marketing strategies, and their exceptional levels of Research and Development (R&D) expenditure. Moreover, MNCs are responsible for recruiting a substantial number of technical and professional employees. By drawing in foreign investment, hosting countries gain immediate exposure to advanced technologies that can benefit not only the recipient nations but also other firms operating within them. FDIs can also contribute to a host nation's balanced payments, augment the labor market, and provide training to employees who can then pass their knowledge onto local firms. In addition, export-oriented FDIs can promote exports by establishing assembly plants that help local firms enter international markets."
"The importance of skilled labor in working with new technologies has been a topic of discussion in light of their adoption. Borensztein et al. discovered that FDI inflows had a negligible direct effect on growth, but in countries where the labor force's education level was above a certain threshold, FDI positively contributed to growth when combined with education. This interaction effect was not significant for domestic investment, which may indicate the technological differences between FDI and domestic investment. Thus, developed countries with a higher level of human capital are likely to gain more from FDIs than developing countries. Xu's study supported this argument, finding that technology transfer by MNCs from the U.S. contributed to the productivity growth in developed countries but not developing countries. Alfaro et al., on the other hand, disagreed with this idea, stating that human capital did not have a mediating role in FDI inflows. They suggested that developing the financial sector was more important than human capital for FDI spillovers.","The utilization of new technologies necessitates a workforce that is capable of comprehending and working with new technology, according to some arguments. Borensztein et al. (1998) discovered that FDI inflows had a minor direct impact on growth, although in countries where human capital exceeded a specific threshold, it did contribute positively to growth when FDI was combined with the country's labor force's education level. Domestic investment, in comparison, did not show a significant interaction effect, possibly owing to the difference in technological disparities between FDI and domestic investment. The results suggest that developed countries, with higher human capital, are more likely to benefit from FDIs than developing countries. This concept is further supported by Xu's (2000) findings, stating that technology transfer by U.S. MNCs contributed to productivity growth in developed countries but not in developing ones. Alfaro et al. (2004), however, diverged from this opinion, stating that human capital was insignificant in mediating FDI inflows. They proposed that the development of the financial sector was more important than human capital in FDI spillovers.","One argument suggests that the adoption of new technologies requires a workforce that is proficient in handling and dealing with such innovative technologies. Borensztein et al.'s (1998) study revealed that FDI inflows had a meager direct impact on growth, but in countries where human capital surpassed a specific threshold, it contributed to growth when combined with the education level of the country's labor force. In contrast, the interaction effect was insignificant for domestic investment, reflecting potential differences in the technology utilized in FDI and domestic investment activities. The findings indicate that countries with higher human capital, notably developed countries, are more likely to benefit from FDIs compared to developing countries. This notion is supported by Xu's (2000) research, which indicated that technology transfer by U.S. MNCs stimulated productivity growth in developed countries but not in developing countries. In contrast, Alfaro et al. (2004) suggested that human capital was not significant in mediating FDI inflows. Instead, they assigned greater importance to the development of the financial sector than human capital in FDI spillovers."
"The relationship between FDI and growth is not entirely clear based on the available empirical evidence. However, the evidence supporting the impact of institutions in the development process is more convincing. North (1990), who is an advocate of economic institutionalism, defines institutions as the humanly created rules and limitations shaping political, economic, and social interaction. Institutions consist of formal guidelines like legal systems, constitutions, and property rights enforced through the proper channels, as well as informal restrictions such as cultural norms, traditions, customs, and values. North also argues that institutions establish the incentive structure of an economy: as the institutional structure sets in, it guides economic progress towards growth. In summary, institutions have an effect on the security of property rights, the level of corruption, the presence of distorted or extractive policies, and thus impact the willingness to invest in human and physical capital, directly influencing economic growth.","While the relationship between FDI and growth cannot be conclusively determined based on the available empirical evidence, the evidence supporting the relevance of institutions in shaping the development process is much stronger. North (1990), widely recognized as an economic institutionalist, defines institutions as the human-made regulations and guidelines that govern political, economic, and social interactions. These institutions comprise formal rules, such as the legal system, constitutions, and property rights that are enforced by relevant agencies, as well as informal constraints, for example, cultural norms, traditions, customs, and codes of conduct. North believes that institutions establish the incentive structure of an economy, and as the institutional structure evolves, it influences economic progress towards growth. To summarize, institutions have a direct impact on the protection of property rights, the prevalence of corrupt practices, the existence of distorted or extractive policies, and ultimately, contribute to the motivation to invest in human and physical capital, resulting in economic growth.","The evidence on the relationship between FDI and growth is mixed, but there is more compelling evidence on the role of institutions in the development process. According to North (1990), an influential economic institutionalist, institutions are the set of humanly structured constraints or regulations that determine how political, economic, and social interactions occur. Formal rules, including constitutions, laws, and property rights enforced by courts and the police, as well as informal constraints, such as cultural norms, taboo, and customs, and agreed-on codes of conduct, are essential features of institutions. North's claim is that these institutions provide the incentive structure of a nation's economy, and as the structure changes, it guides the direction of economic development toward growth. In brief, institutions affect the security of property rights, the prevalence of corrupt acts, the existence of biased or extractive policies, and, consequently, influence the investment choices in human and physical capital, influencing economic growth."
"Several recent studies confirm that institutions are crucial for economic development. Knack and Keefer were pioneers in using property right security indicators, such as ICRG and BERI indices, as proxies for institutional quality in growth research. These institutional indicators included the quality of bureaucracy, property rights, and political stability. Their cross-country analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between these factors and economic performance. Furthermore, Barro argues that secure property rights can enhance growth performance by increasing investment productivity and encouraging investments. Demetriades and Law found that strong institutions are more effective than financial developments in explaining output per capita in low-income countries. Rodrik et al. suggest that institutional quality is more important than geography and trade integration in explaining income differentials. Finally, Acemoglu et al. used the ICRG's protection from expropriation risk index to assess current institutional efficiency.","It has been empirically confirmed by several recent studies that institutions are critical for economic development.

"The correlation between FDI and growth has been explored through empirical studies, but there is still a lack of research when it comes to the spillover effects of FDI in relation to economic freedom. Some argue that countries with more economic freedom will see greater benefits from MNCs, though this has not been backed up by concrete evidence. In order to advance the current understanding of FDI and growth, the next logical step is to gather and analyze more empirical evidence.","Current research on the relationship between FDI and economic growth is limited, particularly when it comes to understanding the impact of economic freedom on FDI spillovers. While it's possible that countries with more economic freedom will see more benefits from MNCs, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support this hypothesis. To move forward in our understanding of the FDI-growth relationship, further empirical research is needed to investigate the role played by economic freedom in this context.","The current literature on the relationship between FDI and growth is lacking in empirical examination of the effects of economic freedom on FDI spillovers. It is possible that countries that allow for greater economic freedom may benefit more from the presence of MNCs, but this has not been substantiated with sufficient empirical evidence as of yet. Therefore, in order to further our understanding of how FDI affects economic growth, research efforts need to be focused on investigating the relationship between economic freedom and FDI spillovers."
"The GMM estimators come in one- and two-step variants, as proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991). One-step estimators utilize weighting matrices that are independent of estimated parameters, while two-step GMM estimators use optimal weighting matrices that rely on consistent estimates of moment conditions' covariance matrices. This results in two-step estimators being more efficient than one-step estimators in the asymptotic limit. However, numerous instruments can lead to biased standard errors and parameter estimates when using the two-step GMM estimator in small samples, as Windmeijer (2005) demonstrated through simulation analysis. Additionally, Bowsher (2002) indicated that numerous instruments may weaken the overidentification test, resulting in an undersized test that fails to reject joint validity at 0.05 or 0.10. Consequently, Roodman (2009b) recommends reducing the dimensionality of the instrumental variable matrix to mitigate these problems.","Arellano and Bond (1991) have suggested using one-step and two-step variants of GMM estimators.

"Based on our empirical analysis using panel data from 85 countries over the 1975-2004 period, three conclusions were drawn. Firstly, FDI has no direct impact on output growth, which is consistent with previous research. Secondly, the study demonstrates the significance of EF as a driver of long-term growth in the countries considered. Support for this finding is also found in earlier studies by de Haan and Sturm (2000) and Sturm and De Haan (2001). Finally, it was determined that the effect of FDI on growth is contingent on the level of EF. Our research indicates that nations that promote economic freedom gain greatly from MNCs' presence, and this is particularly true for developing countries. In such countries, firms can more readily adopt new technologies and other benefits linked with FDI inflows. As a result, certain countries experience greater benefits with acquisition FDI and the presence of foreign multinationals, reflecting the level of their absorptive capacity. It was concluded that EF is an important factor in absorptive capacity, which has so far been underexplored in prior studies.","Our study utilized a panel data of 85 countries covering the period of 1975-2004, and from our empirical analysis, we are able to draw three important conclusions. To start, we find that FDI, as a singular event, has no direct effect on output growth, which is consistent with earlier research. Furthermore, our results also indicate that EF is a critical driver for long-term growth in the countries included in our analysis. Additionally, our findings further strengthen the link between EF and growth, as previously reported in de Haan and Sturm (2000) and Sturm and De Haan (2001). Finally, we conclude that the impact of FDI on growth is reliant on the level of EF in a particular country. We found that countries that prioritize their economic freedom, including developing nations, experience significant benefits from MNCs' presence. This is due to firms being able to easily adopt and incorporate new technologies and other benefits related to FDI inflows. The results also help explain why the benefits gained from acquisition FDI and associated with foreign multinationals' performance advantage differ across countries. The study highlights the crucial role of EF in a nation's absorptive capacity, which has been inadequately examined in prior literature.","Using panel data from 85 countries between 1975 and 2004, our empirical analysis led to three main conclusions. Firstly, we found that FDI alone does not produce a direct impact on output growth, which is in line with previous studies. Secondly, this study determined that EF is a significant driver of long-term growth in the countries examined. This correlates with the findings of previous research by de Haan and Sturm (2000) and Sturm and De Haan (2001). Thirdly, it was also found that the impact of FDI on growth is contingent on the level of EF present in the country. Our data indicates that a greater emphasis on economic freedom leads to significant benefits stemming from the presence of MNCs, particularly in developing countries. This is because such firms are able to more easily integrate new technology and other advantages connected to FDI inflows. This result also helps explain why the benefits of acquisition FDI and association with foreign multinationals with performance advantages are more pronounced in some countries than in others. This study highlights the importance of EF as a crucial element of a nation's absorptive capacity, which has been overlooked in previous research."
"The freedom of trade across borders offers opportunities for domestic firms to expand their business and export products to international markets. Exporting involves significant expenses including distribution, transport infrastructure, and knowledge of foreign consumer preferences, which may be more affordable for multinational corporations (MNCs) than for domestic firms. Domestic firms can enter into foreign markets by observing and learning from the export processes of foreign firms, either through imitation or collaboration. By taking advantage of these opportunities, domestic firms may lower entry costs and improve their operational efficiency. Access to a greater variety of intermediate goods and capital equipment through international trade is also beneficial for increasing productivity at home. These aspects are consistent with Romer's (1990) view that trade can enhance resource allocation and productivity.","Domestic enterprises can tap into overseas markets and export their products by utilizing the benefits of cross-border trade. Exporting involves a range of costs including the establishment of distribution networks, transport infrastructures, and understanding international consumer preferences - expenses that multinational corporations (MNCs) may be better suited to handle. By observing or partnering with foreign exporters, domestic firms can lower entry costs and streamline their operations. This can lead to improvements in the productivity of domestic firms in the long run. The diversification of intermediate products and capital equipment as a result of international trade can also increase productivity at home.

"Reducing regulatory restrictions such as those on labor, business, and credit is essential for promoting spillovers in FDI. For instance, by easing regulations on hiring and firing, there will be a greater degree of labor mobility as workers from MNCs bring their knowledge and expertise to domestic firms. Additionally, the level of regulatory constraints on business activities can affect FDI spillovers through market competition. If regulations are low, MNCs are more likely to share their technology with domestic suppliers to maintain competitive prices. Access to external funds is also critical to technology upgrading, and reducing regulatory constraints can help domestic firms acquire new technology more easily. This was emphasized by Alfaro et al. (2004).","To encourage spillovers in FDI, reducing regulatory constraints such as labor, business, and credit is very important. For example, less regulation on hiring and firing workers in the host country could promote labor mobility between companies. This would allow workers with knowledge and experience gained from working at MNCs to transfer that knowledge to domestic firms. Moreover, the level of regulations on the business activities of MNCs could have an impact on FDI spillovers. If the competition in a particular industry is high due to fewer regulations, MNCs could be more willing to transfer technology to their domestic suppliers to obtain intermediate goods at competitive prices. Access to external funds is also critical for technology upgrading, and reducing regulatory restrictions can increase the chances for domestic firms to acquire new technology. Alfaro et al. (2004) emphasized the importance of financial markets for FDI spillovers.","The reduction of regulatory burdens, such as those on labor, business, and credit, is crucial to promote spillovers in FDI.

The level of regulatory constraints on business activities can also affect FDI spillovers through the market competition. MNCs can be more willing to transfer their technology to domestic suppliers to secure intermediate goods at a competitive price if the level of competition is high (i.e., few regulations). The success of domestic firms in acquiring new technology depends on access to external funds, which can be enhanced by reducing regulatory constraints. Alfaro et al. (2004) highlighted the importance of financial markets in spillovers of FDI."
"Policymakers must consider the cost of policies intended to lure foreign investment in contrast to policies aimed at enhancing the level of economic freedom. Strategies to attract foreign investment should be subordinate to policies that prioritize economic freedom because they are likely to yield more significant benefits. Countries that do not implement these strategies may fall behind in the competition. Policymakers need to enact transparent policies that are clear to potential investors before considering other means of attracting greater foreign investment. However, implementing these changes could be a challenging process that necessitates a long-term commitment. Despite the fact that these reforms may encounter short-term political opposition in some countries, the long-term economic advantages could be enormous.","To ensure economic growth, policymakers must consider the cost-effectiveness of policies that promote foreign direct investment against those that prioritize increasing economic freedom. Rather than prioritizing policies that attract FDI, policymakers should concentrate on policies that enhance economic freedom since they tend to produce better outcomes. Countries that do not follow suit risk getting left behind in the competition. Policymakers must create clear and transparent policies to attract potential investors before resorting to other means of attracting high levels of foreign investment. However, making these reforms can be a tough and demanding task that requires a long-term commitment. In some nations, they may encounter significant political resistance in the short term, but the long-term economic advantages may be significant.","Policymakers should evaluate the cost of promoting foreign investment in contrast to enhancing economic freedom. Policies that enhance economic freedom should be prioritized over strategies aimed at attracting FDI since they tend to produce better outcomes. Countries that fail to implement such policies risk losing their competitive edge.

Nevertheless, enacting these reforms can be a difficult process that requires a long-term commitment. These initiatives may encounter significant political resistance in the short term in some countries, but the scope of long-term economic benefits from these measures should not be overlooked."
"It is essential to acknowledge certain limitations, despite the findings' importance. Our main specification's interaction term compels the impact of FDI on growth to either rise or decline consistently with the level of EF. Nevertheless, it is possible that FDI may require a specific level of EF before it can have an effect on host countries. Only countries with high absorptive capacity can benefit from foreign capital, as countries with low absorptive capacity may not derive much or any benefit from FDI. As a result, there is a need for a more adaptable specification to accommodate diverse types of interactions between FDI, output growth, and economic freedom. One feasible solution is to use a regression model dependent on the threshold effects concept to capture the presence of contingency effects. We aim to examine this in future research.","Despite the important findings, there are some caveats that we need to consider. The interaction term in our main specification forces the impact of FDI on growth to either increase or decrease monotonously with the level of EF. However, it's possible that FDI needs a specific level of EF before it can have any impact on host countries. This means that only countries with greater absorptive capacity, as noted by World Bank (2001) and others, are likely to benefit from foreign capital. Conversely, the benefits of FDI are reduced, or even non-existent, in countries with low absorptive capacity. This highlights the necessity for a more flexible specification to accommodate different forms of interactions between FDI, output growth, and economic freedom. One solution we could opt for is to use a regression model based on threshold effects to capture the possibility of contingency effects, as suggested by Girma (2005), among others. We have left this option open for further research.","It's essential to recognize specific limitations, despite the significance of the findings. The interaction term in our primary specification coerces the impact of FDI on growth to either increase or decrease consistently with the degree of EF. However, FDI may require a certain level of EF before having any influence on host countries. Moreover, as emphasized by the World Bank (2001) and other researchers, countries with higher absorptive capacity are better suited to benefit from foreign capital. In contrast, FDI's benefits might be significantly reduced, or even non-existent, in nations with low absorptive capacity. This stresses the need for a more flexible specification that can account for diverse kinds of interactions between FDI, output growth, and economic freedom. To capture the presence of contingency effects, we may consider using a regression model based on the concept of threshold effects, as explored by Girma (2005) and others. We have left this avenue open for future research."
"Recent research indicates that the age at which an individual engages in sexual activity may influence their life history strategy, due to the impact of early environmental experiences and cues. To further explore this topic, a study evaluated whether the timing of sexual debut could continue to affect LH strategy throughout adolescence. Results showed that women who had their first sexual experience between the ages of 14-18 demonstrated a higher LH speed compared to those who didn't, but this effect weakened as they reached 23 years old. While additional variables may also contribute to a person's LH strategy, the timing of sexual debut may have significant implications that warrant further examination in future studies.","Recent research has illuminated the potential impact of early environmental experiences and cues on an individual's life history strategy with respect to sexual behavior.

"The LH theory was formulated to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the modulation of an organism's reproductive strategies in response to environmental pressures. As restrictions loosen, organisms tend to exhibit reproductive strategies that emphasize quantity over quality, whereas tighter constraints tend to favor strategies that are more restrained and focused on quality. This theoretical framework is applicable to numerous species, including humans, where individual variations in LH strategies are associated with factors such as maturation rate, onset of sexual activity, and allocation of parental resources. Faster LH strategies are characterized by early maturation and sexual debut, more frequent but unstable pair bonding, and decreased parental investment, while slower LH strategies involve delayed maturation and sexual debut, more stable pair bonding with lesser frequency of sexual activity, and greater investment in parenting.","The concept of the Life History (LH) theory was developed to explain how an organism adapts its reproductive strategies according to environmental pressures. In response to elevated constraints, an organism tends to prioritize quality over quantity, while more relaxed restrictions shift the emphasis towards quantity. This theory has been observed across a range of species, including humans. An individual's LH strategy may be influenced by a variety of factors, including the onset of sexual activity, rate of maturation, and parental allocation of resources. A fast LH strategy is characterized by early sexual debut, unstable pair bonding, and reduced parental investment, whereas a slower strategy involves delayed sexual activity, stable pair bonding, and greater parental investment.","Life History theory proposes that an organism's reproductive strategies are shaped by environmental pressures, with elevated constraints prioritizing quality over quantity, while relaxed restrictions emphasize quantity over quality. This theory has been observed across various species, including humans, whose LH strategy may be influenced by factors such as onset of sexual activity, rate of maturation, and parental resource allocation. A faster LH strategy is marked by early sexual debut, unstable pair bonding, and reduced parental investment, whereas a slower strategy entails delayed sexual activity, stable pair bonding, and increased parental investment."
"The theory of LH strategy development has evolved over time, starting with an emphasis on childhood experiences and ancestral environments. Belsky et al. (1991) conducted research that suggested the quality of parental attachment during childhood has a significant impact on an individual's inclination towards either a fast or slow LH strategy. Specifically, a secure attachment leads to a slower LH strategy focused on delayed maturation and sexual debut, while an insecure attachment results in a faster LH strategy characterized by early maturation, unstable pair bonds, and lower levels of parental investment in offspring. The importance of early childhood experiences in forming an individual's developmental trajectory towards a fast or slow LH strategy cannot be overstated, particularly during the first 5-7 years of life.","The theoretical foundations of LH strategy development have undergone significant transformation over time, with initial emphasis placed on the role of childhood experiences and ancestral environments. Research conducted by Belsky et al. (1991) revealed that an individual's tendency towards either a fast or slow LH strategy is significantly influenced by the quality of parental attachment during early life. Attachment security fosters slower LH strategy adoption focused on delayed maturation and later sexual debut, while insecure attachment triggers faster LH strategy with early maturation, unstable pair bonds, and reduced parental investment in offspring. The significance of early childhood experiences in shaping an individual's developmental trajectory towards a fast or slow LH strategy cannot be overstated, particularly during the crucial formative stage of the first 5-7 years of life.","The development of LH strategy has undergone significant transformation over time, with initial emphasis on the role of childhood experiences and ancestral environments. Research conducted by Belsky et al. (1991) revealed that an individual's tendency towards either a fast or slow LH strategy is significantly influenced by early life experiences.

"The concept of LH strategy being rigidly predetermined by a certain age may be unfounded as new research shows that genetic inheritance is not the only factor. Rather, external and physical factors can influence individual LH strategies while plasticity in LH strategies may persist beyond the first decade of life. Nonetheless, the impact of early life experiences compared to later ones on shaping LH strategies remains an ongoing debate, with certain studies highlighting that predictability in the initial five years of life plays a vital role. Experiences in later childhood and teenage years may not have the same effect.","Recent studies suggest that the assumption that LH strategy is solely determined by genetics and age may not hold true. Instead, external and physical factors have been found to influence an individual's LH strategy and plasticity in this regard may persist beyond early childhood. However, debate continues as to whether early life experiences have a greater impact on LH strategies than later ones, with some studies indicating that predictability in the first five years of life plays a critical role, while experiences in adolescence and later stages may not have the same effect.","Recent research has indicated that the traditional belief that one's LH strategy is solely determined by inherent biological factors and age may be erroneous. There is now evidence to suggest that external and physical factors can significantly impact an individual's LH strategy, and that there may be a level of plasticity in this regard that can persist beyond early childhood. However, there remains a degree of debate on the relative significance of early life experiences compared to later ones, with some studies indicating that predictability in the first five years of life may play an especially crucial role in the development of LH strategies, while the experiences of adolescence and beyond may have a less pronounced effect on this aspect of human behavior."
"""The theory proposed by Del Giudice in 2009 posits that additional factors beyond the age of seven impact LH strategies, and early adolescence, specifically the onset of adrenarche, acts as another switch point that affects the development of LH strategies. This notion has been further expanded upon by Ellis et al. and Del Giudice and Belsky, who suggest that cue-based plasticity extends throughout puberty and into later adolescence. Dunkel et al. also provide evidence to support the idea that LH strategies are subject to ongoing adjustments throughout development, even beyond the age of 5 to 7, and that maternal authoritative parenting during adolescence can predict later LH strategy.""","Emerging research suggests that additional factors beyond just age impact LH strategies, with early adolescence, specifically the onset of adrenarche, acting as yet another switch point that plays a significant role in their development. According to prominent theories proposed by Del Giudice and Belsky, as well as Ellis et al., cue-based plasticity continues to shape LH strategies throughout puberty and even into later adolescence. Dunkel et al. provide evidence to support this notion, showing that LH strategies are subject to ongoing adjustments throughout the course of development, and that maternal authoritative parenting practices during adolescence can have significant implications for one's later LH strategy.","Recent research has unveiled that age is not the only determinant for LH strategies, unveiling early adolescence, adrenarche onset, as a crucial switch point affecting LH development. The Del Giudice and Belsky theories, coupled with Ellis et al.'s, suggest that LH strategies undergo cue-based changes throughout puberty and further into late adolescence. Dunkel et al.'s research upholds this idea, revealing ongoing adjustments to LH strategies across development, with maternal authoritative parenting during adolescence holding significant implications for later LH strategy."
"The research team behind this study is examining the ways in which LH strategy evolves throughout adolescence, taking into account the critical role of plasticity. Specifically, they have turned their attention to the age at which individuals have their first sexual experience as a potential factor impacting the development and shaping of LH strategies. While sexual debut is traditionally analyzed as a dependent variable, the team considers it to be a powerful LH cue that can have a significant influence on LH speed. Previous research, such as that conducted by Vigil et al. (2005), has suggested that childhood sexual abuse can advance LH speed, potentially because sexual intercourse represents a key element of LH development. As a result, women who experienced childhood sexual abuse often experience earlier menarche, chastity, and childbirth.","The researchers involved in this investigation are currently studying the progression of LH tactics during adolescence, taking into consideration the crucial concept of plasticity. More specifically, they are honing in on the age of an individual's first sexual experience as a potential factor that could impact the shaping and development of LH tactics. Although sexual debut is typically viewed as the outcome variable, the team perceives it as a potent LH cue with the power to significantly affect LH speed. Earlier endeavors of this nature, such as Vigil et al.'s (2005) research, have indicated that childhood sexual trauma could expedite LH speed, possibly due to sexual interaction's role in LH development. Subsequently, women who reported experiencing childhood sexual trauma were more likely to experience earlier menarche, chastity, and childbirth.","The researchers are presently focused on examining how LH tactics evolve during adolescence with the crucial factor of plasticity in mind. They are delving into the potential impact of an individual's initial sexual experience on the shaping and progress of LH tactics, with the perception that sexual debut may serve as a powerful LH cue capable of significantly influencing LH speed. Earlier studies in this vein, such as Vigil et al.'s (2005) findings, have suggested that childhood sexual trauma may expedite LH speed by virtue of sexual interaction's role in LH development. As a result, women who reported experiencing childhood sexual trauma appeared more likely to experience early menarche, a state of chastity, and earlier childbirth."
"The results of the investigation indicate that engaging in sexual activities initiates a rapid LH (life history) strategy. The proposed theory proposes that the aforementioned reaction is owing to intrinsic prompts associated with the activity of engaging in sexual intercourse, which were advantageous and relevant for reproductive achievement in the past. As per the research, intrinsic prompts may be a more trustworthy predictor than extrinsic prompts from the environment. Consequently, the decision to experience sexual intercourse may elicit a transition in emphasis from growth to amplified reproductive efforts, leading to a surge in LH speed.","The study conducted revealed that participation in sexual activity triggers a swift LH (life history) strategy. According to the theory proposed, this reaction is due to inherent cues associated with sexual intercourse that were advantageous and relevant for reproductive achievement in previous eras. Moreover, intrinsic prompts may present as a more reliable predictor than environmental extrinsic prompts. Subsequently, the decision to engage in sexual intercourse can instigate a shift in focus from growth to heightened reproductive efforts, resulting in an upsurge in LH pace.","The study revealed that sexual activity can act as a catalyst for the activation of an immediate LH strategy. The proposition is based on the idea that cues associated with intercourse were critical in past times for reproductive success. Furthermore, the study found that intrinsic signals are more dependable as predictors than extrinsic cues in determining sexual behaviors' impact on LH pace. As a result, when individuals decide to engage in sexual activity, it can cause a shift in priorities from growth to reproductive efforts, leading to a surge in LH pace."
"Sexual debut has a complex interplay with the development of the human reproductive system, and its effects on life history speed differ between males and females. Various empirical studies have shown that the costs of losing virginity are more pronounced for women than for men, leading to a greater tradeoff between growth and reproduction for ancestral females. These findings indicate that the initiation of sexual activity may have a more profound impact on the LH strategy of adolescent girls than boys in contemporary societies. For instance, Block and Block (2006a) provide compelling evidence demonstrating that early sexual debut is associated with a faster LH trajectory among females, which underscores the importance of social and cultural factors in shaping the life course of human individuals.","It is widely acknowledged that sexual debut is a pivotal event in the life of an adolescent, marking the transition from childhood to adulthood. While the effects of age at sexual initiation on reproductive outcomes have been extensively studied, the impact of this event on life history strategies (LHS) remains poorly understood. Research has suggested that the timing of sexual debut may be an important predictor of LHS, with earlier initiation of sexual activity associated with a faster LH trajectory in both males and females. However, the relationship between sexual debut and LH strategy is complex and likely influenced by a range of social, cultural, and biological factors. Further research is needed to better understand these complex relationships and their implications for human development and evolution.","Sexual debut is a crucial milestone in adolescent life that demarcates the shift from childhood to adulthood.

"Between the ages of 14, 18, and 23, a panel of experienced raters administered a comprehensive personality assessment known as the CAQ to evaluate each participant's individual personality traits. These evaluations were subsequently analyzed against a predefined LH strategy template, and each participant was given a respective rating based on the degree of conformity to that template.

"The researchers first adjusted for LH speed at age 14 and then gradually added various covariates such as SES, ethnicity, IQ, maternal and paternal authoritative parenting, and intimacy level with partner to examine their impact on the relationship between LH strategy at age 18 and sexual debut. Table 2 displays that, while controlling for LH strategy at age 14, there was a significant correlation between LH strategy at age 18 and sexual debut, but this relationship ceased to exist at age 23. Interestingly, the association between sexual debut and LH strategy at age 18 shifted as the number of covariates increased.","The researchers conducted a thorough analysis by controlling for LH speed at age 14 and then gradually incorporating various factors such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity, intelligence quotient, maternal and paternal authoritative parenting as well as an intimacy level with a partner. Upon examination, Table 2 indicates that although the correlation between LH strategy at age 18 and sexual debut was significant while controlling for LH strategy at age 14, the association became non-existent at age 23.

"According to the findings of the research, when it comes to females, the association between sexual debut and LH strategy remained consistent at the age of 18 and surprisingly became even stronger as additional elements were taken into account by the age of 23. The study also involved calculating change scores to gauge the impact of sexual debut on LH speed over time. The results indicated that the ones who engaged in sexual activity during their adolescent years faced a slower LH speed in comparison to those who did not, although the limitations of statistical power were observed in the between-subjects change score comparisons. These discoveries assisted the researchers in explaining the considerable links detected in the study.","According to recent research, it was found that females who experienced sexual debut exhibited a consistent association with LH strategy at the age of 18, and interestingly, this association became even stronger when additional factors were taken into account by age 23.

"Recent studies have posited that the adaptability of life history strategies persists beyond early childhood. Specifically, there has been conjecture that the timing of sexual initiation may influence LH strategies, particularly by expediting LH progression during adolescence. Additionally, it has been suggested that females may be more susceptible to this effect. To evaluate these theories, analyses were carried out to investigate the association between sexual debut and LH strategy at ages 14, 18, and 23.","Recent research indicates that life history strategies may not be set in stone early in life. Rather, some experts suggest that the timing of sexual initiation could impact such strategies, potentially accelerating developmental milestones during adolescence. Furthermore, there is some evidence to suggest that females may be more prone to experiencing these effects. In order to test these hypotheses, researchers have examined the relationship between the age of sexual debut and life history strategy at various ages, including 14, 18, and 23.","Recent studies have revealed that life history strategies are not necessarily predetermined in early life. Rather, some scientists propose that the timing of sexual initiation may have an impact on such strategies, perhaps even accelerating developmental milestones during adolescence.

To investigate these ideas, researchers have explored the relationship between age of sexual debut and life history strategy at different stages of development, including 14, 18, and 23 years old."
"The empirical evidence collected by the researchers has yielded several potential conclusions. The observations suggested that female individuals who experienced their first sexual encounter may have had a discernible impact on the general trajectory of their LH strategy. After controlling for numerous factors, such as LH strategy during early adolescence, it was noted that young women who engaged in sexual activity during their teenage years demonstrated a swifter LH speed in later adolescence and early adulthood. These findings are suggestive of the developmental changes in the raw LH score that occur over time, with scores increasing as individuals age. Moreover, the data indicated that those who refrained from engaging in sexual activity during adolescence exhibited a more modest uptick in LH scores as compared with those who did engage in sexual activity during that period.","The extensive and comprehensive empirical data accrued by the researchers revealed significant and intriguing findings. The collective observations point towards the possibility of a notable correlation between the timing of a female's debut sexual experience and the trajectory of their LH strategy, with those engaging in sex during their teenage years displaying a prompter LH speed during subsequent years of adolescence and early adulthood, after controlling for several relevant factors. The results also proposed that there exists a notable difference in the rate of change in LH scores as individuals mature, with adolescent sexual activity apparently having an amplifying effect on the subsequent LH score values. Furthermore, the data implied that adolescents who abstain from sexual activity manifest comparatively minor LH upticks, in contrast to those who engage in early sexual activity.","The empirical data obtained by the researchers have yielded intriguing and significant findings. It appears that there may be a notable correlation between a female's timing of sexual debut and their LH strategy trajectory. The findings suggest that adolescents engaging in sexual activity during their teenage years exhibit a faster LH speed during their subsequent adolescence and early adulthood years, even after accounting for various relevant factors. Additionally, it seems that there is a discernible distinction in the rate of change in LH scores as individuals mature, with those engaging in sexual activity during adolescence displaying an amplification effect in subsequent LH score values. In contrast, adolescents abstaining from sexual activity exhibit comparatively minimal LH upticks."
"Given the dynamic nature of human development, it is difficult to ascertain the precise effects of sexual debut on women's intrasexual competition and mate attraction strategies. While sexual intercourse may serve as a cue for transitioning into a fast LH stage, the degree to which this shift persists into adulthood remains unclear. It is plausible that virginity loss may prompt a temporary shift towards investing in mating effort between ages 14 and 18, subject to further recalibration as developmental events unfold. Subsequent life stage-associated shifts in LH after age 18 are likely to diminish the impact of early adolescent events on later outcomes. Ultimately, the complex interplay between individual life experiences, socio-cultural factors, and psychobiological processes underscores the multifaceted nature of human sexual dynamics.","Human sexual behavior is a multifaceted and dynamic process, the consequences of which are often difficult to pin down. Research on the impact of sexual debut on mate selection and intrasexual competition among women is inconclusive, with some studies suggesting a short-term investment in mating effort after virginity loss, while others propose that the effects are subtle and age-dependent. Nevertheless, it is plausible that early sexual experiences can influence the development of complex socio-cognitive processes that guide sexual behavior in adulthood. Factors such as individual variation in personality, cultural norms, and biological imperatives all play a role in determining human sexual dynamics, underscoring the complexity of predicting the effects of a particular event in the long term.","The multidimensional nature of human sexuality renders it exceedingly difficult to ascertain the lasting implications of early sexual experiences. Despite intensive research into the effects of sexual debut on mate choice and intrasexual competition among females, the literature is rife with controversies and inconsistencies, disallowing any definitive conclusions. However, it is conceivable that sexual initiation may instigate the emergence of complex socio-cognitive processes that can potentially influence sexual behavior throughout adulthood. Multiple factors, including but not limited to individual personality differences, cultural conventions, and biological imperatives, all contribute to the intricate matrix that governs human sexual dynamics, making it almost impossible to anticipate the consequences of any singular event in the long run."
"The research data indicates that fluctuations in LH are governed by signals during early and late stages of growth. In the past, biometric indices have been employed to indicate different LH tactics among individuals. The correlational results corroborate the notion that the onset of sexual activity may have an impact on the swiftness of LH progress and the degree of commitment to pursuing mating opportunities. It seems that the timing of sexual debut and LH maturation in youth are indeed interconnected.","The pattern of LH fluctuation is regulated by early and late growth signals, which is supported by research data. In previous studies, biometric indices were utilized to distinguish various LH tactics in individuals, and the correlation analysis implies that the timing of sexual initiation may influence the speed and degree of LH development for seeking mating opportunities. Hence, it is reasonable to suggest that sexual debut and LH maturation are closely associated in youth.","The modulation of LH fluctuation appears to be modulated by multiple extrinsic and intrinsic variables, as demonstrated by empirical findings. Prior research has employed diverse biometric markers to differentiate distinctive LH patterns in individuals, and the data analysis indicates that the timing of sexual initiation may exert a substantial effect on the tempo and extent of LH escalation, which promotes opportunities for reproductive success. Therefore, it follows logically that the onset of sexual activity and LH maturation interplay dynamically during adolescence."
"It is imperative to recognize certain limitations when it comes to analyzing the timing of sexual initiation and LH strategy, as genetics may play a role in these processes. Even with various factors taken into consideration, the lingering impact of genetic factors cannot be excluded. It is also important to note that the relationship between LH strategy velocity and sexual debut may not persist as individuals advance into adulthood. Therefore, more comprehensive research is crucial to investigate the interplay between biological and psychosocial factors in the maturation of LH strategy throughout the lifespan.","It is expedient to acknowledge that constraints may exist when examining the timing of sexual initiation coupled with LH strategy, as heredity may exert an influence on these processes. Despite the incorporation of various factors, the persistent impact of genetic determinants cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the linkage between the velocity of LH strategy and first sexual intercourse may not be persistent as individuals advance into the latter stages of life. Hence, more all-encompassing research is essential in ascertaining the interplay between biological and psychosocial factors that impacts LH strategy maturation across the lifespan.","It is imperative to acknowledge the complexities involved in investigating the timing of sexual initiation in relation to LH strategy, as genetic factors may exert a significant influence on these processes. Despite efforts to account for multifaceted variables, it is critical to recognize the continuing impact of inherited determinants. Moreover, it is important to note that the correlation between LH strategy velocity and initial sexual activity may not remain consistent as individuals progress through different stages of life. Consequently, comprehensive research is vital for elucidating the intricate interplay between biological and psychosocial factors that contribute to the maturation of LH strategy across the lifespan."

"Recent research has illuminated the idea that a person's capacity for skillfully manipulating objects in order to attain an objective could potentially have an impact on their perception of said object. Interestingly, those who exhibit higher levels of proficiency in activities such as ball striking, golfing, football, dart throwing, archery, and even piloting are more likely to perceive the objects involved as being larger in size in comparison to those who struggle in those endeavors. What these findings suggest is that one's perception is not solely determined by the objective physical elements of an object, but rather by their ability to effectively interact with that object to achieve a desired outcome, which is in line with the concepts set forth in Gibson's theory that perception essentially codifies the nature of an individual's relationship to the environment they inhabit.","Recent research has unveiled the fascinating notion that an individual's aptitude to adroitly manipulate objects to attain goals could potentially impact their perception of said objects. Intriguingly, those who display heightened levels of proficiency in pursuits such as striking balls, golfing, playing football, hurling darts, engaging in archery, and even piloting planes are more prone to perceiving the respective objects as being larger in size in contrast to those who struggle in these activities. These findings imply that an individual's perception is not solely determined by the objective, physical aspects of an object but rather by their proficiency in interacting with it to accomplish a desired end, which is in sync with the principles set forth in Gibson's theory that perception is essentially the transcribing of an individual's relationship to the environment they inhabit.","Recent investigations have revealed a fascinating proposition that the aptitude of an individual to adeptly manipulate objects to achieve goals could potentially affect their perception of said objects.

"A comprehensive investigation of the links between action and perception has revealed numerous action-specific effects with varying levels of explanation. Despite efforts to discern the underlying mechanisms behind these effects, the matter remains under investigation, as there are multiple plausible alternatives, including those based on experimental constraints, memory-based factors, and attentional focus. Specifically, recent research into attentional accentuation, which suggests that objects that we focus our attention on become more noticeable, has been shown to be a potential explanation for the relationship between intention to act and object perception. For example, golfers who direct their attention toward a hole are more likely to notice changes in hole size, emphasizing the importance of attentional focus in shaping perception.","Recent studies investigating the complex relationship between action and perception have uncovered a multitude of specific effects that are yet to be fully explicated. Indeed, researchers have yet to fully tease out the underlying mechanisms that account for these effects, as there are several plausible explanations, including limitations of experimental design, the contribution of various memory-based factors, and the role of attentional focus. One intriguing possibility is the phenomenon of attentional accentuation, which posits that objects which are the focus of our attention are more likely to be perceived. For instance, golfers who fixate their attention on the hole are more apt to notice any changes in its size, underscoring the importance of attentional focus in shaping perception.","Recent investigations into the complex interaction between actions and perceptions have unearthed a plethora of specific effects that have yet to be fully elucidated. In fact, the fundamental mechanisms that account for these effects are still not entirely clear due to a number of potential factors, including limitations in experimental design, the impact of various memory-driven influences, and the role of attentional concentration. One intriguing possibility is the concept of attentional accentuation, which proposes that objects that we actively attend to are more likely to be perceived. For example, golfers who intently focus on the hole are more likely to detect any changes in its dimensions, highlighting the critical role of attentional concentration in influencing perception."
"The empirical evidence available in support of this hypothesis is compelling. Research undertaken to examine action-specific perceptions in high-pressure situations, where responses were required to be quick and accurate, has demonstrated a consistent trend. It was found that when participants were required to throw darts at a target while experiencing heightened levels of anxiety, their ability to accurately perceive the target was significantly impeded, leading to a negative correlation between target size and throwing performance. This finding is consistent with the distraction theory of anxiety and self-monitoring, suggesting that in high-pressure situations, individuals are less able to focus their attention on the intended target, shifting their gaze and cognitive faculties towards the sources of stress in their environment, with negative consequences for task performance.","The phenomenon of action-specific perceptions in situations of high pressure has been extensively studied, and the overwhelming evidence supports the notion that heightened anxiety significantly impairs an individual's ability to accurately perceive and respond to their intended target. In particular, research has demonstrated that when asked to perform an action such as throwing darts, the combination of anxiety and stress can lead to a negative correlation between target size and throwing performance. This is in line with the widely accepted distraction theory of anxiety and self-monitoring, which posits that non-target stimuli in a high-pressure situation can capture an individual's attention and interfere with their ability to accomplish their task. The implications of this finding are significant, as it speaks to the complex interplay between cognitive and affective processes in our daily lives.","The empirical investigation of action-specific perceptions in conditions of elevated pressure has been examined in depth, and the multitude of findings substantiate the concept that heightened levels of anxiety considerably impede an individual's capacity to accurately perceive and respond to their designated objective. Specifically, numerous studies have shown that when tasked with executing an action such as throwing darts, the combination of stress and anxiety can generate an inverse correlation between size of the intended target and accuracy of said action. This aligns with the generally accepted theory of anxiety-induced distraction and self-consciousness, which asserts that extraneous stimuli in high-pressure situations can capture an individual's attention and interfere with their ability to complete their assignment. This discovery is significant in that it underscores the intricate interaction between cognitive and emotional processes in our everyday lives."
"The present research endeavor aims to examine the impact of attention on perception with regards to the execution of specific actions. This investigation builds on precedents in anxiety research and performance outcomes. Earlier studies failed to elicit conclusive evidence that modifications in action-specific perception were due to attentional focus changes.

"The investigation of golf putting skills suggests that an individual's focus on a particular skill may have an adverse effect on the accuracy of their putting. This impact can lead to a range of kinematic changes, including elevated club-ball impact velocity, a decrease in the time necessary to achieve peak speed, and modifications in downswing amplitude and distance of travel. Typically, these changes manifest in beginner-level golfers, yet no previous research has reviewed the relationship between these motor changes and the apparent size of the target object. Additionally, there has been no study that has evaluated the direct manipulation of attentional focus and its impact on perception of size, despite the assumed connections between attentional focus and fixation patterns.","The examination of the putting skills in golf has indicated that a person's concentration on a specific skill could have detrimental effects on the precision of their putting. These consequences could lead to various changes in kinematics such as a rise in the speed at which the club hits the ball, a reduction in the amount of time taken to reach maximum velocity, and alterations in the distance and amplitude of the downswing movement. These modifications are commonly seen in amateur golfers, but current research has not explored the connection between these motor adjustments and the perceived size of the target object. Furthermore, no study has investigated the direct manipulation of attentional focus and its impact on the perception of size, even though it is widely assumed that attention and fixation patterns are closely linked.","The investigation of golf putting skills has uncovered that the fixation on a specific aspect of the skill may have negative repercussions on the accuracy of one's putting.

Consequently, these three regularities have been confirmed as pivotal in governing individual and group recognition memory performance, with their specific operation being explicated by Signal Detection Theory."
"The findings from a prior research endeavor by Glanzer and colleagues (2009) indicate that object recognition aligns with Green and Swets' (1966/1974) Signal Detection Theory, as evidenced by likelihood ratios (LR) across three stages of experimentation.","The results from a preceding research endeavor conducted by Glanzer and co-authors (2009) suggest that object recognition is aligned with Green and Swets' (1966/1974) Signal Detection Theory, as shown by probability ratios (LR) over three phases of experimentation.","A previous study conducted by Glanzer and colleagues (2009) found empirical evidence supporting the notion that object recognition adheres to Green and Swets' (1966/1974) Signal Detection Theory.

"In the 2009 publication, the concept of the Mirror Effect was briefly touched upon, as well as the potential for bias to obscure its measurement. The authors of this paper aim to provide an in-depth analysis of these issues, revealing that the Mirror Effect can indeed be affected by bias. In order to mitigate this effect, the authors suggest four different strategies, including utilizing a more informative index of the Mirror Effect, cancelling out the bias with a pay-off arrangement, employing a between-list design, and increasing the accuracy difference between the familiar and unfamiliar conditions.","The novel concept known as the Mirror Effect was briefly mentioned in a 2009 publication, with a nod to the potential for bias to affect its measurement. However, the authors of this current paper have taken a deeper dive into the issue, uncovering evidence of the Mirror Effect's susceptibility to bias. To combat this, the authors recommend incorporating one of four different strategies, such as implementing a more comprehensive index of the Mirror Effect, introducing a pay-off system to counteract the influence of bias, using a between-list design, or increasing the disparity of accuracy between the familiar and unfamiliar conditions.","In an intriguing recent study, researchers delved deeper into the novel concept referred to as the Mirror Effect, uncovering compelling evidence that shows the potential susceptibility of this phenomenon to be influenced by bias. To mitigate this somewhat alarming tendency, the authors put forth a number of distinct tactics to consider, including perhaps devising a more expansive index to measure the Mirror Effect's impact, establishing a pay-off program to counteract any interfering biases, incorporating a between-list design, or oscillating the accuracy disparity between familiar and unfamiliar conditions. These proposed solutions certainly merit more exploration and could ultimately enhance the accuracy of Mirror Effect analyses going forward."
"It has been brought to attention that the survey conducted in Glanzer et al.

The administration of cognitive tests can be disrupted by various forms of prejudice when an analyst has misconstrued the probability of an object being archaic. The likelihood ratio procedure is a way of elucidating how former interactions and the impacts of stimuli can influence decision-making. The overestimation of certain alternatives can result in prejudicial judgments. This concept was explored by Wickens in 2002.,The evaluation of cognitive examinations can be disrupted by a variety of biases when analysts misinterpret the likelihood of an object being archaic. The probability ratio procedure enables clarification of how prior experiences and the effects of stimuli can impact decision-making processes. Overestimation of specific alternatives may lead to discriminatory verdicts. The idea was researched in 2002 by Wickens.,"The complex interplay between cognitive examinations and external biases can have a profound impact on the accuracy of decision-making processes, particularly when considering the likelihood of an object being archaic. The probability ratio procedure represents a powerful tool for disentangling the various factors that can influence our judgments, allowing analysts to better understand the ways in which prior experiences and present stimuli can impact our assessments. However, it is crucial to note that even with such sophisticated methodologies at our disposal, there remains a risk of overestimating the prevalence of certain alternatives or making discriminatory verdicts based on flawed assumptions.

"The Mirror Effect has been a topic of interest in psychology for many years. Researchers have been trying to understand why humans tend to perceive themselves as being more accurate than they actually are. One common method used to analyze this effect is to compare the results of two situations and measure the difference between them. It is important to consider both the hit and FA rate for each situation in order to accurately measure the occurrence of the Mirror Effect. Additionally, various bias measures should be taken into account to ensure accurate findings. These methods are all listed in Table 3, which provides a comprehensive breakdown of the most important measures used in the study of the Mirror Effect.","Researchers have shown considerable interest in exploring the Mirror Effect, which has been a topic of inquiry in the field of psychology for a significant period of time.

"The results of the previous study indicate that participants have a lower likelihood of responding positively to unfamiliar names, which could potentially hinder the observation of the Mirror Effect using the H/FA Index. To address this issue, the researchers employed differential payoffs to negate the bias and encourage a reversal of the observed bias.

In response, Hoshino proposed that the findings were likely due to differential bias. Undeterred, a third experiment was conducted with two separate groups administering different conditions. While the first group's results mirrored those from previous experiments, the second group's findings confirmed Hoshino's preliminary conclusions, providing definitive evidence of a violation of the H/FA Index due to differential bias."

"The results of the study indicate that reducing the number of familiar names led to an increase in the accuracy of recognizing items, resulting in a more pronounced contrast between familiar and unfamiliar items and the recovery of the Mirror Effect. However, the unexpected consequence of this reduction was that responses to familiar names became more liberal, indicating a double effect on accuracy and bias. The researchers suggest that this could be linked to the salience of familiar names, which, in turn, generates relatively liberal responses. This finding suggests that, by reducing the number of familiar names, their salience increased, leading to even more liberal responses.","The empirical findings revealed that the reduction in the familiarity of the names resulted in a marked improvement in the accuracy of item recognition, which created a distinct contrast between familiar and unfamiliar items and caused a revival of the Mirror Effect. Strikingly, the decrement in familiarity had an unforeseen outcome of enhancing the leniency in responding to familiar names, indicating a dual effect on both bias and accuracy. The researchers proposed that this could be attributed to the heightened salience of the familiar names, which in turn increased the probability of responding more liberally. This discovery suggests that decreasing the number of familiar names can intensify their saliency, which could trigger even more liberal responses.","The study's empirical findings indicated a clear improvement in item recognition accuracy as familiarity with the names decreased. This enhancement created a noticeable differential between unfamiliar and familiar stimuli, resulting in a revival of the Mirror Effect. Interestingly, the reduction in familiarity unexpectedly boosted leniency towards familiar names, impelling a dual impact on both bias and accuracy. Researchers suggested that this counterintuitive outcome may be due to the heightened salience of the familiar names, which as a result, increased the chance of more liberal responding. These findings suggest that reducing the number of familiar names can further intensify their salience, potentially prompting even more liberal responses."
"The empirical findings presented in the paper indicate that SDT can successfully predict multiple regularities in cognitive processes. Additionally, the authors propose that the fundamental mechanisms underlying these regularities can be distilled into three core concepts: sensitivity, bias, and the LR decision axis. Notably, SDT is even capable of accounting for situations when mirror regularity is absent. Furthermore, although process models of recognition memory invoking SDT and the LR component operate at distinct levels, they do not contradict the overarching SDT model. Overall, the authors provide compelling evidence for the versatility and explanatory power of SDT in cognitive science research.","The study's empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of Signal Detection Theory (SDT) in accurately predicting various cognitive processes, and suggest that the fundamental mechanics governing said processes can be reduced to three core principles: sensitivity, bias, and the LR decision axis.

"The empirical observations obtained from a rudimentary memory experiment can be rationally justified without entailing the utilization of latent rationale in decision-making processes, by instating that judgments are formulated solely based on unprocessed intensity cues. Nevertheless, for experiments of greater complexity featuring the presence of two sets of conditions, decisions predicated on intensity cues are no longer effective, thereby necessitating the incorporation of latent rationale conversion in calculations in order to identify underlying patterns in the data.","The empirical observations derived from a simple memory experiment can be logically supported without the need for the utilization of underlying reasoning in the decision-making process, by asserting that judgments are formed solely on unprocessed intensity cues.

In these scenarios, the integration of covert reasoning processes must be implemented in order to reveal the underlying patterns present within the data."
"The phenomenon of 'The Mirror Effect' can be attributed to a multitude of factors, which have led researchers to propose various theories in order to explain this intriguing phenomenon. One such theory is the Criterion Shift, which postulates that the decision-making process is not solely based on a single criterion, but rather influenced by a range of factors that may shift the emphasis placed on various criteria in order to arrive at a final decision. Another theory known as Two-Process is also believed to play a role in this effect, which suggests that the decision-making process involves both an automatic and a controlled process, both of which work to influence the final decision. These theories offer valuable insights into how and why individuals arrive at certain decisions and can help to shape future research in this field.","'There exists an array of factors that can be linked to the emergence of 'The Mirror Effect'.

"Numerous scientific investigations have revealed that both WN and SN are mutable and may fluctuate. In these controlled trials, patients were asked to make strategic selections between WN and SN objects, leading to zero preferences. The resultant reports demonstrated a clear segregation between the two modern distributions SN and WN, with SN being distinctly lower than WN. Such findings were consistent across all five experiments mentioned in the study, where the dnn coefficients were negative, suggesting a definite division between the two recent distributions, and SN being inferior to WN by a distance of -dnn.","Recent scientific investigations have conducted comprehensive analyses of the mutability and fluctuation of both WN and SN.

"The Mirror Effect is often described through the two-process theory which is inherently linked to the lexical frequency Mirror Effect. The theory postulates that individuals utilize a familiarity/strength decision axis which results in low frequency new words being less familiar than high frequency new words. However, studies have shown that low frequency words are learned and recollected much more effectively than high frequency words which ultimately leads to the Mirror Effect inequality, HO < LO. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of how new words are acquired and processed in the brain.","The Mirror Effect phenomenon has been oft-associated with the dual-process framework that is tightly interwoven with the Mirror Effect of lexical frequency. This framework purports that people employ the axis of familiarity/strength to make decisions, with lower frequency words being less familiar than their higher frequency counterparts. Notably, however, empirical research has revealed that people learn and recall lower frequency words more effectively than higher frequency words, thereby generating an unequal distribution in the Mirror Effect: HO < LO. These findings have significant implications for how we comprehend the acquisition and processing of novel lexemes in the human brain.","The Mirror Effect is a well-known phenomenon that is often linked to the dual-process framework.

The implications of these findings are significant as they shed light on how the human brain processes and acquires new lexemes."
"The investigative results revealed that The Mirror Effect is a multifaceted phenomenon that can be deciphered using different approaches. For instance, when presented with stimuli that are faster than normal, the recollection process is disrupted, as evidenced by the H/FA Index. However, it's worth noting that the two-process explanation is only applicable to the word-frequency mirror effect and not the name familiarity mirror effect in subsequent experiments. Additionally, the explanation doesn't cover the Variance Effect and the Length Effect, which have their unique underlying mechanisms. These findings signify the complexity of The Mirror Effect and the need for further exploration.","The results of the investigation unveiled that The Mirror Effect is a multilayered sensation that emerges through various means. For example, when presented with stimuli that exceed normal pace, the recall process becomes fragmented, which is evident from the H/FA Index. Nevertheless, it must be highlighted that the two-process explanation holds ground specifically for the word-frequency mirror effect and not the name familiarity surrogate effect in later experiments. In addition, the explanation fails to account for the Variance Effect and the Length Effect, as they have underlying mechanisms unique to themselves. These findings demonstrate the intricacies of The Mirror Effect and emphasize the urgency for further exploration.","The results of the empirical investigation suggest that The Mirror Effect constitutes a complex phenomenon with multiple layers of features stemming from numerous factors. For instance, when participants are subjected to stimuli that exceed the normal processing speed, the retrieval process appears to be disrupted, as highlighted by the H/FA Index. However, it is important to note that the dual-process explanation is only applicable to the word-frequency mirror effect, and not to the name familiarity surrogate effect that emerged in subsequent studies. Furthermore, the theory cannot fully explain the Variance Effect and the Length Effect, which possess distinct underlying mechanisms. These empirical findings point to the intricate nature of The Mirror Effect and underscore the need for further research and investigations."
"It has been found that the extent to which mirror disruption caused by speeding affects word perception is highly dependent on the type of words being processed. Specifically, it has been observed that L words, which generally take longer to process than H words, are more susceptible to the effects of speeding. This is because when speeding is present, the accuracy of both L and H words is reduced, but the decrease is more pronounced for L words. As a result, the difference in accuracy between the two word types is reduced, which can have a significant impact on the H/FA Index in mirror effect studies. In fact, research conducted by Glanzer and colleagues (2009) in Experiment 5 found that a smaller difference in accuracy between L and H words can diminish the likelihood of observing the mirror effect in two-factor mirror disruption studies.","Recent studies have shown that the degree of mirror disruption caused by speeding has a significant impact on word perception, with L words being more vulnerable to such effects as compared to H words. This is because speeding affects the accuracy of both word types, but the reduction in accuracy for L words is more pronounced, thereby diminishing the difference in accuracy between L and H words, a crucial factor in mirror effect studies. Glanzer and colleagues' research (2009) in Experiment 5 further confirms this finding, as a smaller difference in accuracy between word types can lessen the likelihood of observing the mirror effect in two-factor mirror disruption studies. Thus, it is crucial to consider the differential impact of speeding on word perception and word type when studying the mirror effect.","Recent research has revealed that the extent to which mirror disruption occurs due to driving at high speeds has a significant influence on word perception, with low-frequency words being more susceptible to its effects than high-frequency words. The reason for this lies in how a fast driving speed impairs the accuracy of both word types, but with a more pronounced reduction in accuracy for low-frequency words, thus minimizing the gap between accuracy levels for these two types of words. This phenomenon carries particular significance in mirror effect investigations, with Glanzer et al.'s (2009) Experiment 5 supporting this notion further by demonstrating that a smaller gap in accuracy between word types can decrease the likelihood of observing mirror effect outcomes in two-factor mirror disruption studies. Therefore, when exploring the mirror effect, it is critical to account for how different driving speeds influence both word perception and word type."
"The current cohort of SDT, with its employment of the LR decision axis, can account for the empirical findings that uphold the two-process theory without the need to posit additional cognitive mechanisms such as familiarity and recollection. Unlike the two-process model, SDT is not restricted to elucidating the impacts of word frequency, as it can encompass a broader range of experimental manipulations relating to memory and recognition.","The current state of research on memory and recognition posits that there exist two distinct cognitive mechanisms that underlie these phenomena. The first process entails familiarity, whereby an individual is able to recognize stimuli based on their prior exposure to them. The second process is recollection, which involves recalling specific details or contextual information associated with the stimulus. While these two processes were initially thought to be independent, recent advances in SDT have suggested that they are in fact interdependent and can be mapped onto a single decision axis. Furthermore, unlike the simplistic two-process model, SDT is capable of explaining a wider range of experimental manipulations that relate to memory and recognition beyond just word frequency.","Recent research into the complex mechanisms behind memory and recognition has illuminated two distinct cognitive processes that underlie successful recall. Namely, the first process relates to familiarity, whereby a subject recognizes stimuli based on prior exposure. The second process is more intricate and involves recollection of specific details and contextual information associated with the stimulus. This interdependence between the two processes, which were once thought independent, indicates that they can now be mapped onto a single decision axis. Additionally, the sophisticated SDT approach offers a broader perspective from which to analyze experimental manipulations, allowing researchers to better understand memory encoding and retrieval beyond the mere influence of word frequency."
"Surprisingly, the findings from Experiments 2, 3, 4, and 5 contradict the established two-process model and any other hypotheses centering around a decision axis based on strength or familiarity. These competing explanations suggest that unfamiliar new names (UN) would naturally have lower values than familiar new names (FN) on the decision axis, which would preclude the occurrence of the mirror effect. However, the principles of SDT, which utilize a LR decision axis, yield an order that is the exact opposite, with FN having lower values than UN and producing a full mirror effect.","Despite previous models and hypotheses emphasizing decision axes based on strength or familiarity, Experiments 2, 3, 4, and 5 reveal surprising findings that contradict these established theories. Specifically, unfamiliar new names (UN) were expected to naturally have lower values than familiar new names (FN), which should preclude the mirror effect from occurring. However, utilizing the principles of SDT and a LR decision axis yields an order that is opposite to these assumptions, with FN actually having lower values than UN and consequently producing a full mirror effect.","Through conducting various experiments, researchers have discovered that the existing hypotheses related to decision axes based on strength or familiarity are not always accurate. In fact, the findings from Experiments 2, 3, 4, and 5 contradict these established theories and reveal some surprising insights.

The data suggests that FN actually has lower values than UN, which results in a full mirror effect."
"Several research studies have substantiated the veracity of the ""Mirror Effect"" that is evoked by familiarity. These investigations have probed varying degrees of familiarity with terms, monikers, visages, and melodies.

"'The current generation of researchers, led by Rouder and his colleagues, have voiced skepticism regarding the validity of claims linking the asymmetry of ROCs to variations in the underlying distribution's variance.

Despite introducing alternative z-ROCs from different models with matching variances to Mickes et al.'s findings, Rouder et al. ultimately concluded that no methodology currently exists to evaluate the relative variability of latent mnemonic strength distributions.

Nevertheless, Wixted and Mickes (2010) have called into question this conclusion, and additional studies are necessary to resolve this debatable area of research.","The present generation of researchers, led by Rouder and his colleagues, have expressed reservations when it comes to accepting claims that link ROC asymmetry and variations in the distribution's variance. This skepticism is a direct result of Mickes et al.'s (2007) research, which seemed to demonstrate the connection between variable slopes and the SDT model's unequal variance. Despite the introduction of alternative z-ROCs from other models that have the same variance, Rouder et al. ultimately found that there are currently no available methods to assess the comparative diversity of hidden memory strength distributions. However, Wixted and Mickes (2010) have challenged this conclusion, and further research is needed to address this area of contention."
"The concern of Pratte, Rouder, and Morey (2010) centers around the potential issue of interpreting ROC asymmetries where z-ROC slopes are less than 1.0. They suggest this could be a result of data averaging rather than reflecting a true pattern. However, utilizing a hierarchical unequal-variance signal detection model, they were able to conclude that these asymmetries are indeed a valid phenomenon rather than a distortion stemming from averaging data.","The work of Pratte, Rouder, and Morey (2010) is centered on the potential issue of interpreting ROC asymmetries where the z-ROC slopes are less than 1.0.

"Automated methods for evaluating the similarity of scanpaths have been developed by Shepherd and her colleagues (2010). To enhance accuracy, the scanpaths are first transformed to have uniform time intervals and are then matched to the shorter of the two.

"The similarity score between two scanpaths is established through a measure that considers both the spatial and temporal dissimilarities between fixation locations. Nevertheless, this method does not take into account the fixation durations and leans towards resampling approaches to evaluate temporal similarity, neglecting the differences in fixations' durations. Therefore, two scanpaths employing the same spatial positions might differ in fixation durations, which could potentially result in a lower similarity score. A significant limitation of this method is the arbitrary radius threshold utilized, closely akin to other grid-based quantization approaches such as ScanMatch and string-edit.","While the quantization methods utilized in scanpath analysis consider the dissimilarities between fixation locations in space and time, they disregard the distinctive nature of fixation durations, resulting in lower similarity scores. Additionally, the resampling approach employed tends to overlook temporal variations, leading to an incomplete analysis of fixation dynamics. The use of arbitrary radius thresholds also poses a significant limitation to the method, similar to other grid-based quantization measures like ScanMatch and string-edit.","While examinations of scanpath data can be extremely beneficial in identifying and characterizing natural gaze patterns, the quantization procedures that are commonly used fail to fully consider the nuanced variances in both fixation location and duration. This shortcoming invariably leads to lower similarity scores and incomplete analyses of fixation dynamics, particularly as the resampling method typically applied neglects temporal changes. Furthermore, the inherent limitations of grid-based quantization measures, such as ScanMatch and string-edit, are also manifest in the arbitrary threshold radii employed in the process."
"The degree of fixation overlap can be influenced by the differing timing of two scanpaths, while the impact of positional variation is relatively negligible due to the incorporation of radius. These findings suggest that the efficacy of this metric may closely mirror that of the ScanMatch evaluation, which similarly incorporates both spatiotemporal similarities within scanpaths.","Despite the fact that the degree of fixation overlap can be influenced by the timing of two scanpaths, positional variation seems to have minimal impact due to its incorporation of radius. These results suggest that the efficacy of this metric may closely reflect that of the ScanMatch evaluation, which also takes into account spatiotemporal similarities within scanpaths. These findings may have significant implications for future research into eye-tracking analysis and suggest that there may be potential for more sophisticated and nuanced approaches to analyzing gaze behaviour.","Despite the inherent complexity of gaze behaviour analysis, recent advancements in eye-tracking technology have allowed for more precise measurement of fixation overlap and positional variation.

"The measurement of scanpath correlation is a highly sensitive process that takes into account both temporal and spatial variations of two given scanpaths. This attribute can be particularly beneficial when the timing of stimuli changes need to be accurately measured. Unlike other methods that only focus on fixation overlap, this technique doesn't require any spatial quantization, and it takes into account position similarities through correlation analysis. The process is also sequential, taking into account the order of fixations. It is worth noting, however, that this technique may not be as reliable with noisy data as other methods that employ a grid or radius.","The positional similarity correlation of scanpaths is a highly sophisticated measurement technique that can accurately assess both temporal and spatial variances between two given scanpaths. This method is particularly advantageous when it comes to measuring the precise timing of changes in stimuli. Contrarily, other techniques that focus solely on fixation overlap require spatial quantization, which is not essential in this method. Sequentially, the order in which fixations occur is of utmost importance. Although there is a possible drawback of this technique being less reliable when noisy, it has clear advantages over methods that are based on a grid or radius.","The employment of the positional similarity correlation of scanpaths as a technique for measurement is highly sophisticated and possesses a remarkable ability to evaluate the spatial and temporal variances that are distinctive between two different scanpaths. This method has a unique advantage in precisely determining alterations in stimuli by concentrating on the fixation order rather than fixation overlap, making spatial quantification redundant. Nonetheless, this method has a potential drawback in being less reliable in noisy circumstances. Nevertheless, it still presents considerable advantages over grid or radius-based methods."
"Researchers Shepherd et al. (2010) introduced a novel metric named gaze-shift, which assesses the saccade duration and distance between two separate scanpaths.

"The gaze-shift measure has been proven effective in determining similarity between amplitudes, and though it may coincide with the MultiMatch measure that also calculates eye movement likeness, studies have indicated that the latter measure is only reliable in comparisons within/between images.

"The distance-based approach to comparing scanpaths is often preferred over string-edit methods due to its lack of dependence on quantization. This method evaluates fixations based on spatial similarity rather than their order, but may overlook significant sequential information. To counteract this, a modified version has been introduced to establish an exclusive one-to-one mapping between two scanpaths, though the original method still averages out fixation clusters. Linear distance has been shown to effectively compare fixation patterns in previous experiments and is particularly useful for analyzing within-participant similarities.","It is common for researchers to prefer the distance-based approach to comparing scanpaths over string-edit methods.

"It has come to my attention that laminarity measures the frequency of fixations on a specific area in both scanpaths. This measurement is highly related to determinism and a high score indicates clusters of fixations in a particular region. If laminarity is high but determinism is low, it means that the number of fixations on a specific area was different between the two sets of sequences. To clarify, laminarity is simply a measure of fixation clustering in two distinct sequences.","I have recently gained insight into the fact that laminarity serves as a pivotal determinant of fixation frequency on a specific area in scanpaths. This form of analysis closely associates with determinism and is indicative of the presence of fixation clusters in a given region if the score is elevated. However, if the score displays high laminarity but low determinism, this suggests a lack of parallelism in the number of fixations on the same area in both sequence sets. To put it simply, laminarity allows for the evaluation of fixation clustering between two distinct scanpaths.","The recent acquisition of knowledge has led me to realize that laminarity plays a critical role in determining fixation frequency on a particular area within scanpaths.

"The center of recurrence mass (CORM) is a metric that gauges the predominant lag time between cross-recurrences of visual sequences. A small CORM value indicates that corresponding fixations occur near to one another, while a large CORM value implies a significant delay between cross-recurrences. The direction of the delay - either positive or negative - can signal which sequence takes the lead or follows the other. The CORM value, therefore, plays a crucial role in identifying this directional relationship. For the purposes of the study, the absolute value of CORM was utilized since there was no a priori hypothesis regarding which sequence would lead or follow. Low CORM values were anticipated when examining scanpaths produced by a participant while viewing the same image repeatedly or when scrutinizing scanpaths within a single image.","The identification and measurement of the center of recurrence mass (CORM) is pivotal in evaluating the prevailing time lag between cross-recurrences of visual sequences.

The direction of the delay, either negative or positive, is indicative of which sequence takes the lead or follows the other, thus adding to the significance of CORM in elucidating the directional relationship between the sequences. To account for the absence of a priori hypothesis regarding the leader or follower, the absolute value of CORM was employed in the research. This method is most suitable for investigating scanpaths of a participant while repeatedly viewing an image or scrutinizing scanpaths within a single image, as it provides low CORM values.","The utilization and quantification of the center of recurrence mass (CORM) plays a fundamental role in assessing the time lag between cross-recurrences of visual sequences.

For instance, while some studies have suggested that semantic memory enhances episodic memory performance, others have found no support for this claim. Notably, the Annis et al. (2013) study showed that the use of semantic memory did not increase OI in an episodic task. However, there is still a debate about whether OI occurs within semantic tasks. Despite the differences in their functions and structures, the two memory systems are interdependent, as they rely on each other heavily. Semantic knowledge is initially learned episodically and later becomes more generalized, resulting in a durable, resistant semantic memory that is less prone to interference from episodic events.","The relationship between semantic and episodic memory has been the focus of various studies, but the results have been ambiguous. Some studies have hinted at the likelihood of semantic memory enhancing episodic performance, whereas others have found no evidence to support this claim. Annis et al.'s (2013) research revealed that utilizing semantic memory did not heighten OI in an episodic task. Nonetheless, a dispute regarding whether OI happens in semantic tasks is still pervasive. Despite their distinct functions and compositions, the two memory systems have a strong interdependence, relying heavily on each other. Semantic information is first acquired episodically but eventually becomes generalized, leading to long-lasting semantic memory that is less susceptible to interference from episodic occurrences.","The complex relationship between semantic and episodic memory has been extensively researched, undeniably producing equivocal results. Certain studies suggest that semantic memory may enhance episodic performance, while others fail to confirm this assertion. Recent research conducted by Annis et al. (2013) indicates that the utilization of semantic memory does not impact OI in an episodic task. Nonetheless, the debate surrounding OI in semantic tasks persists. Despite their fundamental differences in structure and function, these two memory systems rely heavily on each other, displaying a strong degree of interdependence. Semantic information is initially acquired episodically, but over time becomes more generalized and solidifies into long-term semantic memory which is less susceptible to interference from episodic occurrences."
"To conduct their analysis, the researchers utilized a Bayesian approach in conjunction with a frequentist regression to ascertain the existence and extent of evidence supporting or refuting a null effect. Their investigation focused on changes in test performance across multiple trials, probing for the presence of a nonzero slope in performance change whilst also examining potential shifts in this slope across Test 1 and Test 2. Interpreting the model parameters from their Bayesian regression aligned closely with typical procedures employed within the frequentist tradition.","The researchers employed a Bayesian approach in conjunction with a frequentist regression in their analysis.

"The novel procedure formulated by our cohort, known as the Savage-Dickey approach, involves a discerning appraisal of the verisimilitude of observing a zero slope in the posterior distribution vis-a-vis the probability of the proposed inclination in the prior distribution. Our method hinges on the Bayes Factor (B01), which serves as the arbiter determining whether the null hypothesis holds true or if the alternative hypothesis prevails. Specifically, if the BF is less than 1, then the zero slope is more viable in the prior distribution, and the null hypothesis is strengthened. Conversely, if the BF exceeds 1, the hypothesis validating a non-zero inclination is supported. The computations were executed through the dependable system software of JAGS in tandem with the Brjags package implemented in R.","The efficacious method employed by our particular cohort, known as the Darian-LeGrand approach, facilitates an astute examination of the plausibility of detecting a null slope in the posterior distribution in relation to the possibility of the proposed inclination in the prior distribution. Our modus operandi centers around the Bayes Factor (BF01), which acts as the arbiter to determine whether the null hypothesis remains viable or if the alternative hypothesis prevails. Specifically, if the BF is less than one, then the null hypothesis is bolstered based on the more tenable zero slope in the prior distribution. However, if the BF exceeds one, the hypothesis which validates a non-zero inclination is supported. The procedure was executed via JAGS system software in conjunction with the Brjags package in R, thus ensuring dependable computations.","The method utilized by our distinguished cohort, labeled as the Darian-LeGrand approach, facilitates a meticulous analysis of the feasibility of detecting a null slope in relation to the potentiality of the proposed inclination. Our operative procedure revolves around the Bayes Factor (BF01), which serves as the adjudicator to ascertain whether the null hypothesis remains tenable or if the alternative hypothesis prevails. Notably, if the BF is less than one, then the null hypothesis is reinforced based on the more feasible zero slope in the prior distribution. Contrarily, if the BF surpasses one, the hypothesis that substantiates a non-zero inclination is substantiated. The methodology was implemented through JAGS system software jointly with the Brjags package in R, consequently ensuring reliable calculations."
"During the course of the experiment, two tests were administered and the results were analyzed. The findings, as depicted in Figure 2, indicate that Test 1 showed consistent performance across multiple trials, while Test 2 demonstrated a decline in performance with each trial. The profile plot denoted in Figure 2a plots the performance of Test 1 in a particular test block. Additionally, an interaction term was calculated between the two tests and it was observed that Test 2 had a higher value with a considerable decline in performance over time, while Test 1 remained steady. There were some indications of a difference between the slopes of the two tests.","During the experiment, two assessments were carried out and the outcomes were meticulously scrutinized. The findings, depicted in Figure 2, indicate that Test 1 exhibited consistent performance across multiple trials, while Test 2 displayed a gradual decline in performance with each trial.

Interestingly, certain observations hinted at the possibility of a difference in the slopes of the two tests, although this requires further investigation."
"It is possible that the observed OI in Test 2 is a result of both active knowledge search and recent memory, with the latter having a stronger influence on OI. In order to examine this theory, the accuracy of Test 1 response was analyzed; when the response was correct, OI was not present, but when it was incorrect, participants may have occasionally generated a correct response for Test 2 through guessing or by effectively using semantic memory search. There is also the possibility of using episodic memory for Test 1 feedback to generate a correct Test 2 response, which could explain the significant increase in accuracy. Given these conditions, it is likely that OI would be observed.","It is plausible that the presence of observed OI in Test 2 may be due to both active knowledge acquisition and recent memory retrieval, but the latter may have a more potent impact on OI occurrence. To test this hypothesis, the accuracy rate of responses in Test 1 was subjected to analysis. Findings show that OI was not apparent when the response given in Test 1 was correct. However, instances where responses were incorrect may have spurred a correct response for Test 2 through guessing or by effectively tapping into the semantic memory system. Moreover, utilizing episodic memory of Test 1 feedback to generate a correct Test 2 response could account for the marked increase in accuracy. In light of these dynamics, it is probable that the phenomenon of OI would manifest itself.","Given the observed OI in Test 2, it is reasonable to posit that the interplay of active knowledge acquisition and recent memory retrieval may have contributed to this phenomenon. However, it appears that the latter may have a stronger effect on OI occurrence. To further explore this theory, we analyzed the accuracy rate of responses in Test 1. Results indicate that OI was not present when Test 1 responses were correct. On the other hand, incorrect responses in Test 1 may have influenced a correct response in Test 2 through guessing or by accessing the semantic memory system. Additionally, incorporating episodic memory from Test 1 feedback into generating a response for Test 2 could also explain the significant increase in accuracy. Based on these dynamics, it seems apparent that the phenomenon of OI is highly likely to manifest itself under these conditions."
"The data presented in Figure 3a suggest that participants who provided correct answers in Test 1 appeared to maintain consistent performance on Test 2 regardless of its position. Conversely, those who provided incorrect answers in Test 1 exhibited a marked decrease in performance on Test 2 as its position varied, as evidenced by Figure 3b. The Bayesian analysis corroborated these findings, with the presence of a positive interaction term indicating a steeper slope for Test 2 when Test 1 responses were incorrect. Moreover, the slope for Test 2 when Test 1 responses were correct was flat, with evidence supporting the likelihood of both zero and nonzero values. Thus, null hypothesis testing was inconclusive in this instance.","The empirical evidence presented in Figure 3a appears to suggest that there is a strong positive correlation between the accuracy of responses in Test 1 and consistent performance on Test 2, irrespective of its position. On the other hand, participants who did not provide correct responses in Test 1 exhibited a significant decrease in performance on Test 2 with varying positions, as clearly demonstrated by Figure 3b. The Bayesian analysis lends further credence to this finding, as it reveals a positive interaction term that signifies a steeper slope for Test 2 when Test 1 responses were incorrect. Additionally, the slope for Test 2 when Test 1 responses were correct was found to be consistent, with evidence supporting both zero and nonzero values. Consequently, the results of the null hypothesis testing proved to be inconclusive in this respect.","The empirical evidence displayed in Figure 3a suggests a powerful and optimistic correlation between the accuracy of responses in Test 1 and sustained performance on Test 2, regardless of its placement. Nonetheless, those participants who failed to provide proper responses in Test 1 exhibited a substantial decrease in their performance on Test 2 with varying positions, as uncovered by Figure 3b. A Bayesian analysis further supports this discovery by highlight a positive interaction term, indicating a steeper slope for Test 2 when Test 1 responses were incorrect. Furthermore, the slope for Test 2 when Test 1 responses were correct remained consistent, with evidence supporting both zero and nonzero values. Thus, the null hypothesis testing produced inconclusive results in this regard."
"Upon performing Bayesian analysis, it was discovered that the results gathered were corroborated by a frequentist multiple regression on the amalgamated data of all the participants. When assessing the impact on performance, it was determined that Test Block and Test 1 accuracy had a noteworthy influence, while the Test 2 performance change across blocks was affected by the correctness of the response in Test 1. Interestingly, the slope of change was lower when Test 1 response was correct as compared to when it was incorrect.","A thorough Bayesian analysis was conducted, revealing significant convergence with a comprehensive frequentist multiple regression model applied to the pooled data of all participants. Examination of performance depicted Test Block and accuracy in Test 1 as instrumental factors while Test 2 progress across blocks was reliant on the precision of the Test 1 response. Notably, the slope of change was effected by whether the Test 1 response was correct or incorrect, the former resulting in a lower rate of change.","A rigorous Bayesian analysis was conducted, which discovered significant convergence with an extensive frequentist multiple regression model applied to the aggregated data from all the participants. An investigation of the results suggested that Test Block and accuracy in Test 1 were crucial factors, while progress in Test 2 across blocks relied on the precision of the Test 1 response. It should be noted that the magnitude of change was influenced by whether the response in Test 1 was correct or incorrect, with the former resulting in a slower rate of change."
"Analysis of participant responses to a set of queries revealed a marked shift in their approach between the first and second tests. During the initial round, there was no discernible pattern of output interference (OI), indicative of reliance on semantic memory. However, after receiving corrective feedback, there was a clear OI effect observed during the subsequent round, particularly evident in questions that had been answered incorrectly previously. This pattern implies a shift towards episodic memory use, leading to increased OI in the output.","Through the utilization of participant responses to an array of inquiries, a noteworthy alteration in their methodology emerged between the primary and secondary evaluations. Initially, there was no apparent output interference (OI) ascertained, which denotes reliance on semantic memory. However, after the provision of constructive feedback, a conspicuous OI effect transpired during the ensuing round, notably in questions previously answered inaccurately. This trend indicates a shift towards utilizating episodic memory, thereby facilitating increased OI in the output.","Through the implementation of an extensive survey instrument, a significant transformation in their approach emerged between the first and second evaluations. In the initial phase, no apparent output interference (OI) was observed, indicating a reliance on semantic memory. However, after receiving positive feedback, a noticeable OI effect was observed during the subsequent phase, particularly in areas where errors were present in previous responses. This pattern demonstrates a shift towards episodic memory utilization, resulting in enhanced OI in the output."
"It appears that individuals rely on two distinct types of memory- episodic and semantic- in order to accurately answer questions. Episodic memory is more susceptible to the influence of environmental factors, while semantic memory is comparatively resilient. Interestingly, attempting to remember the conditions in which information was originally acquired, a habit that is commonly advised in textbooks, may actually be detrimental to knowledge-based tests. This is because excessive emphasis on contextual factors can impede the mind's ability to recall relevant information, due to interference from other similar contextual cues.","It has been observed that individuals rely on two distinct modes of recollection, namely episodic and semantic memory, to accurately answer questions. While episodic memory can be more sensitive to environmental factors, semantic memory is relatively robust. It is noteworthy that attempts to recall the context in which information was originally acquired may not always be beneficial, as undue emphasis on contextual cues can disrupt the retrieval of relevant information by causing interference from similar cues. This realization may have implications for the development of more effective study strategies and test-taking techniques.","Individuals rely on two distinct forms of memory, episodic and semantic, to accurately answer questions.

These insights have direct implications for the development of more effective study techniques and test-taking strategies."
"The findings of our study demonstrate that the manifestation of OI appears to be unrelated to the extent of continuous knowledge searches, given that a set of shared knowledge questions were utilized. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that OI was observed to persist in situations where test participants were provided with corrective feedback during the preliminary examination, which potentially implies that semantic memory could be modulated by episodic information. In light of these observations, we can infer that there are certain limitations to how semantic and episodic memory are interrelated.","Based on the results of our analysis, it appears that the expression of outward influence does not appear to be correlated with the degree of continuous information retrieval, as measured by a set of standardized knowledge queries. However, it should be noted that instances of outward influence were still present even when subjects were given corrective feedback during the initial examination, suggesting that semantic memory may be affected by episodic information. These observations suggest that there may be limitations to the way in which semantic and episodic memory are interconnected.","""After conducting a thorough analysis, it appears that there is no discernible correlation between the outward expression of influence and the level of continuous information retrieval, as indicated by a variety of standardized knowledge queries. However, it should be noted that there were still instances of outward influence even in situations where participants received corrective feedback during the initial evaluation, which could suggest that semantic memory is indeed affected by episodic information. These findings lend support to the notion that there may be certain limitations regarding the interplay between semantic and episodic memory systems."""

"Through an evaluation of both retrospective and laboratory studies, it has been discovered that crying may yield both positive and negative effects on mood. To further understand this paradox, individuals were assessed on their mood before and after watching a emotionally charged film in a laboratory setting. Surprisingly, those who shed tears initially experienced a higher increase in negative emotions, but ultimately recovered quicker and ended with an overall improvement in their overall mood. These findings contribute to the idea that crying may indeed be a beneficial tool in restoring an individual's emotional well-being over an extended period of time.","After conducting a comprehensive analysis of both retrospective and experimental literature, it has been established that the act of shedding tears has the potential to evoke both positive and negative effects on mood. In an effort to gain deeper insights into this perplexing phenomenon, researchers conducted a study whereby participants were first assessed for their prevailing mood levels before and after being exposed to a highly emotional film in a laboratory setting. Strikingly, those who exhibited teary responses initially experienced a more pronounced surge in negative emotions, but ultimately managed to rebound faster, resulting in a marked improvement in their overall emotional well-being. These findings lend credence to the notion that crying may in fact serve as an effective means of restoring emotional equilibrium over an extended period of time.","After extensively reviewing both retrospective and experimental literature, it has been determined that the shedding of tears may elicit a range of positive and negative mood responses.

"Crying is a universal and complex behavior that can be interpreted in a variety of ways, depending on the context and culture. While humans are the only species that can shed emotional tears, crying can serve different functions for different individuals, ranging from a release of tension and stress to the expression of helplessness and the need for support. Some scholars argue that crying is a cathartic process that helps individuals cope with negative emotions, while others suggest that crying is a form of social signaling that elicits empathy and assistance from others. Regardless of its purpose, crying remains a fundamental aspect of human behavior that reflects our capacity for emotional expression and connection with others.","The concept of crying as a universal behavior is one that has been explored by scholars from a variety of fields, ranging from psychology to anthropology. While it is clear that humans are the only species that can shed tears in response to emotional stimuli, the underlying reasons behind this behavior are complex and multifaceted. Some experts argue that crying serves as a coping mechanism for individuals dealing with stress or trauma, while others suggest that crying may serve as a way to elicit empathy and support from others in a social context. Regardless of its purpose, the phenomenon of crying remains a fundamental aspect of human behavior that is deeply rooted in our emotional experience and ability to connect with others on a deeply emotional level.","The concept of emotional expression through tears is one that has been studied throughout many disciplines, including psychology, sociology, and anthropology. Scholars have explored the various purposes that crying may serve, from acting as a stress and trauma coping mechanism to eliciting social support from others.

Nevertheless, the capability to express emotion through tears remains an integral part of human social interaction and the ability to empathize and connect with others."
"Numerous factors can contribute to the variation in findings regarding the impact of crying on emotional well-being. The sample size, population demographics, and measurement techniques employed in studies all play a role in influencing the results. Additionally, the variability in how individuals interpret and respond to their crying experiences further complicates the picture. It is possible that crying can evoke a range of emotions, from relief and release to sadness and despair, depending on the individual, the situation, and the context surrounding the tears. Without a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of crying and its effects on psychological state, the debate regarding its therapeutic benefits is likely to continue.","It is essential to acknowledge the complex and multifaceted nature of crying when considering its impact on emotional well-being. Research findings have varied due to a variety of factors, including demographic differences in study populations, variations in measurement techniques, and differing interpretations of crying experiences. Furthermore, emotions evoked during crying can fall on a broad spectrum, ranging from relief and catharsis to feelings of despair and sadness. Until we gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms at play during crying, assertions regarding its therapeutic benefits will remain shrouded in ambiguity and will lack the necessary groundedness to be confidently recommended for individuals seeking emotional support.","Despite the growing recognition of crying's potential impact on emotional well-being, it remains a subject of debate within the scientific community. Studies have yielded divergent results due to methodological differences and variations in population characteristics, while interpretations of the emotions experienced during crying are often subjective and multifaceted.

"The research outcomes indicated that the changes in mood were notably different over time and there was a significant interplay between time and group, signifying that the groups who cried and didn't cry displayed varying patterns of mood changes. Although, there was no significant overall difference between the two groups. This confirms the hypothesis that distinct emotional responses emerge in relation to crying.","The research findings revealed intriguing patterns in mood changes over time, with a significant interplay between the time and group variables.

Astonishingly, participants who cried versus those who refrained from shedding tears manifested divergent emotional reactions. Nonetheless, the comprehensive analysis indicated no essential variance between the two groups. These findings confirm the initial hypothesis that crying evokes disparate emotional experiences."""
"The team of researchers executed two divergent ANOVA assessments to deduce if there was a discernible shift in emotions in each of the groups. They deduced that there was no noteworthy alteration within the non-crier group over the course of four dimensions; however, in the crier group, there was an evident influence of time. Consequently, post-hoc comparisons illustrated that NA augmented from T1 to T2 only to descend as T3 and T4 approached, which consolidated their preliminary hypothesis. They revealed a remarkable reduction in NA from T1 to T4, signifying comprehensive mood upliftment after shedding tears. Lastly, the anticipated declines in NA endured verifiable even when NA variation from T1 to T2 was accounted for as a covariate in a supplementary ANOVA.","The research team conducted two distinct ANOVA evaluations to ascertain if an observable change was prevalent in emotions among the different groups studied. After conducting the tests, they found that there was no significant difference within the non-weeping group in the four dimensions explored. However, in the group displaying crying behavior, the team observed a clear effect of time. Subsequently, post-hoc comparisons showed that negative affect (NA) increased from T1 to T2 but subsequently declined as the study progressed to T3 and T4, effectively reaffirming the research team's hypothesis. Furthermore, the team identified a prominent reduction in NA from T1 to T4, indicating a general mood upliftment after experiencing tears. Lastly, the expected decreases in NA persisted even when NA changes from T1 to T2 were factored in as a covariate in a supplementary ANOVA.","The group of researchers conducted a set of distinctive ANOVA tests to detect any noticeable variations in emotional responses within various groups under observation.

Follow-up comparisons demonstrated that negative affect (NA) increased from T1 to T2 but ultimately decreased over time, thus confirming the research team's initial hypothesis. Additionally, the researchers observed a marked decrease in the negative affect (NA) from T1 to T4, implying an overall improvement in mood after experiencing tears. Notably, this positive outcome persisted even after considering any changes in NA from T1 to T2, as a covariate in a supplementary ANOVA analysis."
"Recent research suggests that crying may have a beneficial effect on mood. There appears to be a significant decrease in negative affect after crying, which may be attributed to a return to baseline levels after initial increases. This supports the idea that crying has cathartic effects and could potentially have long-term mood-enhancing effects. It remains unclear, however, whether these effects are due to the same mechanisms as those observed in previous studies on the effects of emotion expression on well-being. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms behind the observed effects of crying on mood.","Recent studies indicate that there are possible psychological benefits associated with crying. Apparently, there is a notable reduction in negative emotions after crying, which could be attributed to a return to pre-cry levels following initial spikes. These findings lend credence to the notion that crying may serve as a cathartic release, and potentially have a profound impact on one's emotional state over the long term. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain if these effects are related to those observed in earlier research concerning the influence of expressing emotions on overall well-being. Additional investigation is warranted to better understand the underlying mechanisms through which crying affects mood.","Recent studies suggest that crying may yield psychological benefits. It has been noted that negative emotions are reduced after a bout of crying, potentially due to a return to baseline levels once the intense emotional release subsides. This supports the idea that crying can act as a cathartic release, potentially leading to long-term improvements in emotional well-being. However, it is unclear if these findings are related to earlier research on the impact of expressing emotions on overall health. More investigation is necessary to fully understand the underlying mechanisms at play when it comes to the mood-altering effects of crying."
"It is possible to contend that the reduction in negative affect (NA) observed in those who shed tears during the study's final assessment could have been attributed to the heightened tension and anxiety that participants experienced at the start of the study, as they were in an unfamiliar situation. However, the reasoning behind why non-criers did not exhibit a mood enhancement during the final measurement is not entirely clear. Additionally, it should be noted that both cohorts had similar levels of NA at the onset of the study.","It may be posited that the observed decrease in negative affect (NA) among those who shed tears during the final assessment of the study was potentially due to the initial heightened anxiety and tension that participants experienced upon entering the unfamiliar experimental setting. Despite this, the underlying rationale for the lack of a mood uplift among non-criers at the final measurement remains somewhat ambiguous. It is notable, however, that both groups exhibited comparable levels of NA at the outset of the experiment.","Upon examination of the collected data, it is plausible to suggest that the decline in negative affect (NA) documented in participants who shed tears during the termination of the study may be attributed to the initial elevated state of tension and unease that they experienced upon being introduced to an unfamiliar experimental environment. Nonetheless, elucidating the precise rationale for the lack of a noticeable mood elevation in non-criers at the final measurement remains somewhat obscure. It is pertinent to note, however, that both cohorts displayed comparable levels of NA at the commencement of the investigation."
"Researchers are grappling with uncertainty over the reasons behind the decrease in NA observed in their study. It remains to be determined whether this can be attributed to a shift in mood triggered by crying or a change in the participants' perception of their emotional state. This phenomenon of response shift is a known challenge for cancer patients, who often report an improvement in their quality of life after diagnosis, but retrospective analysis reveals a contrasting decrease in their overall well-being. In order to address this methodological issue, future research will need to employ direct comparisons between the mood states of participants before and after exposure to stimuli, accounting for factors that influence how individuals remember emotional events and regulate their moods.","Researchers are currently grappling with the observed decrease in NA and the underlying reasons for it.

"The connectivity between information-based incentives and elevated cognitive control may not solely arise from momentary neurological reactions to promising rewards. Emerging evidence suggests that information about potential incentives can have a consistent impact on cognitive processing and associated neural activity that persists throughout the task. Recent studies have highlighted the potential for incentive-related motivational states to modulate cognitive performance, showcasing heightened and sustained brain activity across blocks of similar trials displaying incentive information. These findings suggest that rewards may augment cognitive control through both immediate, cue-driven responses and sustained, ongoing responses.","The integration of information-related incentives and elevated cognitive control may not be solely attributed to fleeting neurological reactions to promising rewards. Recent research proposes that information about potential incentives can engender a consistent influence on cognitive processing and associated neural activity that endures throughout the task. Novel studies reveal the capacity for incentive-related states to modulate cognitive performance, exemplifying enhanced and prolonged brain activity across similar trials displaying incentive information. These discoveries propose that rewards could enhance cognitive control not only through prompt, cue-driven responses, but also through sustained, ongoing responses.","Despite existing research pointing to the influence of incentive-based cues on cognitive function, newer investigations suggest that this effect is not solely due to temporary neurological reactions to potential rewards. Instead, evidence suggests that the information related to incentives can have a lasting impact on cognitive processing and the corresponding neural activity, persisting throughout the entirety of a given task. The latest studies have also demonstrated the ability of incentive-driven states to shape cognitive performance, with sustained and elevated brain activity observed across multiple trials containing incentive cues. Taken together, these findings imply that rewards may not simply boost cognitive control through immediate responses to cues, but also by eliciting prolonged, ongoing effects on cognitive function."
"""Recent research has shown that the provision of rewards and incentives may not produce uniform changes in behavior and neural activity. This is believed to be due to variations in reward sensitivity at the individual level, which may affect the way in which people respond to both primary and secondary incentives. Several studies have noted a relationship between personality traits associated with reward drive and neural responses to incentives. For example, individuals who score higher on measures of approach and self-control are more likely to display greater neural activity in response to appetizing food in certain brain regions, while those with more extraverted personalities tend to demonstrate greater neural responses to monetary rewards. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of understanding the individual differences in reward sensitivity when predicting how people may respond to incentives or make decisions about their behavior.""","Recent scientific inquiry has illuminated the notion that offering rewards and incentives may not always elicit consistent behavioral and neural shifts. This lack of uniformity has been attributed to variations in how individuals process and respond to primary and secondary incentives, which in turn is speculated to be tied to interindividual differences in reward sensitivity. Numerous studies have unveiled correlations between certain personality traits, specifically those linked to reward drive, and patterns of neural activity in response to incentives. For instance, individuals deemed more likely to approach rewards and exert self-control may exhibit heightened neural activation in certain brain regions when presented with delicious food, whereas those with more extroverted tendencies might demonstrate greater neural reactivity to financial incentives. Overall, it is becoming increasingly clear that a better grasp of these individual dissimilarities in reward sensitivity is critical to forecasting individuals' responses to incentives and decisions about their own behavior.","Recent research in the field of neuroscience has provided valuable insights into the complex relationship between rewards and behavior. While traditional assumptions suggest that incentives always result in consistent changes in neural and behavioral responses, recent scientific inquiry has shed light on the variability of this phenomenon, highlighting the intricate ways in which individuals process and respond to different types of incentives. Specifically, interindividual differences in reward sensitivity and personality traits have been shown to strongly influence the way that people react to both primary and secondary incentives, with certain traits being linked to specific patterns of neural activity when presented with rewards. By better understanding these individual differences, it may be possible to improve the efficacy of incentive-based interventions and tailor treatment approaches to better fit the needs of each individual."
"Another critical aspect that influences reward processing is anhedonia, which denotes a diminished ability to experience pleasure. The recognition of rewards as positive or pleasurable is imperative for people to pursue their objectives successfully and retain upbeat emotions. Anhedonia is demonstrated by individual variances in clinical and non-clinical groups of people, and individuals with reduced reward satisfaction are less inclined to modify their conduct to attain their goals. Individuals who exhibit high levels of anhedonia may display weaker cognitive control, less regulation of motivation-related brain activity, or both.","Research has underscored the critical role of anhedonia in modulating reward processing, which is instrumental in facilitating reward-related learning and behaviour. Specifically, decreased pleasure sensitivity is found to exert a robust influence on individuals' ability to perceive and respond to reward outcomes, leading to reduced motivation and goal-directed action. This effect seems to be mediated by deficits in cognitive control and decreased regulation of reward-related neural activity, with behavioural and neural evidence pointing to the involvement of multiple neural circuits and pathways in mediating reward processing and anhedonia. Overall, the complex interplay between pleasure sensitivity, reward processing, and motivation highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying the processing and representation of rewards in the human brain.","Recent studies have identified anhedonia as a critical factor that modulates reward processing, a process that plays a vital role in facilitating reward learning and behavior. Research suggests that decreased pleasure sensitivity has a potent impact on individuals' ability to perceive and respond to reward outcomes, resulting in reduced motivation and goal-directed action. These effects appear to be mediated by deficits in cognitive control and decreased regulation of reward-related neural activity. Further behavioral and neural evidence suggests that multiple neural circuits and pathways are involved in mediating reward processing and anhedonia. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the complex interplay between pleasure sensitivity, reward processing, and motivation and their underlying mechanisms in the human brain."
"The study aimed to investigate the influence of rewards on cognitive control, specifically examining sustained and incentive cue-related effects using fMRI. The DLPFC and striatum were of particular interest due to their past involvement in reward-related cognitive processes. Participants completed a response conflict processing task that was modified to include both mixed state-item designs, allowing for assessments of contextual stability, and reward blocks, in which monetary incentives were provided on select trials. The study hypothesized that the motivational states evoked by reward conditions would elicit greater sustained activation in the DLPFC versus non-incentive baseline conditions and that incentive cues would elicit increased transient activation in both cortical and subcortical reward-related regions.","The present research aimed to investigate the impact of reinforcement on cognitive control processes, with a specific focus on examining sustained and incentive cue-related effects through the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Given previous research implicating the prefrontal cortex and striatum in reward-related functions, these regions were of particular interest. To achieve this aim, participants completed a modified version of a response conflict task featuring both mixed state-item paradigms, allowing for assessments of contextual stability, and reward blocks involving the provision of monetary incentives on select trials. The central hypothesis posited that the motivational states induced by the incentive conditions would be associated with greater sustained activation within the prefrontal cortex in contrast to non-incentive baseline conditions, and that incentive cues would elicit increased transient activation in both cortical and subcortical reward-related regions.","The study aimed to investigate the impact of reinforcement on cognitive processes through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

"The researchers had a dual objective for their investigation. Firstly, they aimed to study the efficacy of rewards in enhancing cognitive control and analyze its impact on brain functionality. Secondly, they aimed to evaluate the influence of anhedonia, a trait in individuals that represents their inability to derive pleasure or enjoyment, on the correlation between rewards, cognitive control, and brain activity.

"The imaging data was subject to thorough analysis and processing via the FIDL analysis package, a software tool developed by Washington University. Signal stabilization was taken into account by disregarding the first four images of each run. Preprocessing measures included correcting for slice-dependent time shifts, eliminating odd/even slice intensity differences arising from interpolated acquisition, compensating for rigid-body motion through data realignment, normalizing image intensity, registering the 3-D structural volume to an atlas template that followed the Talairach coordinate system, coregistering the fMRI volume to the structural image, transforming fMRI data into voxel atlas space, and spatial smoothing.

"The results of the study demonstrated a significant relationship between anhedonia and activation in the lateral globus pallidus when participants were presented with cues indicating potential rewards. Specifically, individuals who reported higher levels of anhedonia exhibited lower levels of activation in this region, whereas those with greater hedonic tone demonstrated increased activation. However, it should be noted that the correlation for hedonic tone did not meet the statistical significance threshold for the Bonferroni correction. These findings suggest that an individual's ability to experience pleasure may be linked to their brain's response to reward cues.","A significant positive correlation was observed between anhedonia and reduced activation in the lateral globus pallidus upon presentation of potential reward cues, indicating that individuals with decreased ability to experience pleasure had lower levels of activation in this region. Conversely, those with higher levels of hedonic tone showed increased activation in this region, although the correlation did not reach statistical significance after Bonferroni correction. These findings suggest that variations in the brain's response to reward cues may be associated with differences in individuals' capacity to experience pleasure.","It has been discovered that an exceedingly strong and positive correlation is present between anhedonia and decreased activation within the lateral globus pallidus when confronted with potential cues of reward, leading to the inference that people who lack the ability to derive pleasure tend to exhibit lower levels of activation in this particular region. In contrast, individuals who possess a heightened level of hedonic tone showcase an increase in activation, albeit not significantly after being subjected to the Bonferroni correction. On account of these discoveries, it appears that fluctuations in the brain's response to reward cues could very well be closely linked to disparities in people's capacity to experience joy."
"Recent research has explored the dynamic neural correlates of reward processing, revealing distinct activation patterns among various brain regions. The DLPFC and BG exhibited attenuated activation during the Reward-Choice (RC) condition compared to the RC-Exploit (RCXT) and Benefit-Choice (BCXT) conditions, while other DLPFC regions showed greater activation during the RC condition relative to BCXT. Interestingly, subcortical regions did not display any significant changes in activation across reward-related tasks during Time Point 4, although they presented higher levels of deactivation during RC trials at Time Point 7. These findings suggest that reward processing may be modulated by the participation of multiple neural circuits, as well as the temporal dynamics of available choices.","Recent advancements in the field of neuroscience have provided insights into the dynamic neural correlates of reward processing, revealing distinct patterns of activation among various brain regions. Findings from recent studies have demonstrated attenuated activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia during Reward-Choice (RC) conditions, as compared to RC-Exploit (RCXT) and Benefit-Choice (BCXT) conditions, while other regions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex exhibited greater activation during the RC condition relative to BCXT.

"The results elucidated by the study exhibit amplified activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as well as several subcortical regions, including the lateral globus pallidus and caudate, in response to incentive cues as opposed to no-incentive cues. The identified findings align with prior studies which have identified increased activation in regions associated with cognitive regulation following exposure to incentive cues.","The findings of the investigation display heightened activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and various subcortical areas, such as the lateral globus pallidus and caudate, when presented with incentive stimuli versus no-incentive stimuli.

"Recent studies have suggested that the DLPFC not only plays a crucial role in cognitive control, but also encodes crucial information about both reward-related and task-related value. The DLPFC is highly interconnected with other key brain regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex that are essential in value representation. The DLPFC also sends projections to the BG, which is made up of the caudate nucleus and globus pallidus, and in turn sends feedback to the thalamus, premotor and motor cortices. This circuitry may suggest that the increased activation in response to incentive cues in the DLPFC and striatum could result in superior neural representations of reward value, thereby improving top-down control of activations.","Recent scientific findings have indicated that the DLPFC plays a crucial role in the regulation of cognitive control while also encoding essential data related to both reward and task-related values. This region is known to have strong connections with other vital brain areas such as the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, which are necessary for the representation of value. Additionally, the DLPFC sends projections to the BG, including the caudate nucleus and globus pallidus. Feedback from these structures is then sent to the premotor and motor cortices, as well as the thalamus. This circuitry is believed to contribute to the DLPFC and striatum's increased activation in response to incentive cues, resulting in improved neural representations of reward value and greater top-down control of activation.","Recent scientific research demonstrates that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays a critical role in the regulation of cognitive control while also encoding essential data related to both reward and task-related values.

"The neuroscientific investigation revealed that certain regions in the brain display consistent activity in reward contexts, which further builds upon prior studies demonstrating that certain areas in the fronto-parietal network can exhibit a continual increase in response to reward-related stimuli. This investigation utilized a hypothesis-driven methodology, which may have enhanced the ability to detect sustained effects in the prefrontal and striatal regions. The persistent activity seen in the basal ganglia may be indicative of its involvement in reward-based learning and goal-directed behavior. The heightened activity noted in the dorsal striatum in reward contexts may signify increased effort to maintain information associated with reward, which can facilitate preparatory responses throughout the duration of reward scenarios.","The utilization of a neuroscientific approach unveiled the existence of specific brain regions that exhibit consistent activity in contexts related to rewards, thus complementing previous findings that suggested certain areas in the fronto-parietal network could present a persistent increase in response to stimuli associated with rewards. By adopting a methodology grounded on hypotheses, the study might have increased the potential for detecting sustained effects in the prefrontal and striatal regions. The sustained activity observed in the basal ganglia could imply the involvement of this structure in shaping reward-driven learning and guiding goal-directed behavior. The elevated activity detected in the dorsal striatum in reward-based contexts may suggest a greater effort in retaining information related to reward, which, in turn, might facilitate preparatory responses throughout the entire reward scenario.","The discoveries made via a neuroscientific lens have unveiled the presence of specific areas of the brain that consistently exhibit heightened activity during circumstances related to rewards, thereby complementing earlier findings that suggested certain parts of the fronto-parietal network might persistently react to stimuli associated with rewards. By implementing a scientific approach grounded in hypotheses, this study likely expanded the possibility of uncovering long-lasting effects in the prefrontal and striatal regions. The protracted activity witnessed in the basal ganglia may suggest its involvement in molding reward-centered learning and steering purposeful conduct. The heightened activity found in the dorsal striatum in reward-linked contexts may indicate a more significant investment in retaining reward-related information, which, in turn, could facilitate preparatory responses spanning the entire reward sphere."
"Our study revealed intriguing results surrounding the correlation between anhedonia and neural response to reward-predicting cues. Participants with higher levels of anhedonia displayed reduced neural activation in response to such cues, though no significant relationship was observed between sustained, context-dependent activation in reward contexts and anhedonia. It appears that anhedonia may alter the way rewards affect brain activation and how individuals behave in response to explicit reward cues, but does not seem to have a discernable effect on more comprehensive incentive effects. Further, our findings suggest that anhedonia may impair goal-directed behavior by rendering pursuit of rewards more challenging due to a lack of pleasurable experiences or associated expectations.","Our empirical investigation yielded compelling findings concerning the relationship between anhedonia and neural reactivity to predictive indicators of reward. We discovered that individuals with higher levels of anhedonia exhibited diminished neural activation in response to such cues, although we did not observe any significant association between sustained, context-dependent activation in reward contexts and anhedonia. These outcomes imply that anhedonia may alter the way rewards influence brain activation and modulate individuals' behavior in reaction to explicit reward indicators, while not appreciably affecting broader incentive mechanisms. Additionally, our outcomes suggest that anhedonia may impede purposeful behavior by making the pursuit of rewards more arduous due to a paucity of pleasurable experiences or associated expectations.","Our investigation identified intrinsically linked relationships between a state of anhedonia and the neural reactivity elicited by predictive markers of rewards, serving to establish a noteworthy and compelling conclusion. Our findings demonstrated that individuals with elevated levels of anhedonia exhibited diminished neural activation when presented with such cues, though a significant correlation was not observed linking sustained or context-dependent activation in reward scenarios and anhedonia. The implications of our research indicate that anhedonia can fundamentally change how the experience of rewards influences brain activation, and may influence an individual's behavior with regard to explicit markers of reward, while having a lesser impact on their broader incentive mechanisms. Furthermore, we discerned from our outcomes that anhedonia could disrupt purposeful behavior by increasing the difficulty in pursuing rewards because of the scarcity of pleasurable experiences and associated expectations."
"The findings of the investigation yielded valuable insights into potential neural mechanisms underlying anhedonia, although there were certain limitations. Despite observing swift reaction times in response to reward, conflict effects were not significantly reduced. The study honed in on the DLPFC and basal ganglia, and no areas of interaction effects were observed.

"Although the experiment presented a limitation regarding the order of presentation that could have potentially influenced the context-dependent effects, previous empirical studies, including Chiew and Braver's, suggest otherwise. Chiew and Braver conducted a similar design with randomized incentive trials and concluded that practice effects dissipate after the first epoch, while incentive effects remain significant. Hence, the observed differences between the reward conditions in this study cannot be attributed to practice-related effects. Furthermore, the interleaved RCXT and RC trials were immune to practice effects, adding to the study's robustness.","Although the study did present a limitation with regard to the ordering of the presentation which could have potentially led to context-dependent effects, it is important to note that previous empirical studies conducted by Chiew and Braver suggest otherwise.

"The present study has successfully distinguished between the immediate effects and long-lasting effects of rewards on performance. However, additional research may be conducted to further differentiate these effects through the use of alternative methods. While the current study design accounted for the impact of immediate rewards on individual trials, it did not investigate the potential impact of continuous rewards on participants' overall performance throughout a series of trials. To address this gap in literature, a future study could involve notifying participants of a bonus at the end of a block of trials based on their overall performance. This design would allow for the examination of both sustained, general incentives and individualized, transient reward cues on performance outcomes.","The present study has effectively distinguished between the immediate and long-term effects of rewards on performance, providing valuable insights into the impact of incentivization.

Nonparametric testing was also implemented, relying on Mann-Whitney U test and Binomial test, in cases where smaller groups were involved or the data did not meet the necessary assumptions.","The study aimed to examine the possible links between various factors, including an individual's age, gender, IQ, specific types and degrees of parent-reported ASD symptoms, along with medication use and intermediate mental health care, and the stability of different psychiatric disorders. The groups were analyzed, including those who displayed persistent disorders, those who transitioned from disorder to non-disorder, those who continued to be free of any disorders, and those who developed a disorder after previously not exhibiting any. The data were subjected to a range of statistical tests, including T-tests, Chi Square tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and Binomial tests, depending on the size of groups, the nature of the data, and meeting necessary assumptions.","The current study sought to explore potential associations between a variety of factors, encompassing an individual's age, gender, IQ, specific types and severities of ASD symptoms reported by parents, as well as medication usage and intermediary mental healthcare, in relation to the robustness of different psychiatric disorders. The sampled groups were comprehensively examined, comprising of those who maintained ongoing disorders, those who transitioned from a state of disorder to one of non-disorder, those who remained free of disorders, and those who developed a disorder subsequent to not previously exhibiting any symptoms. To analyze the data, diverse statistical methods were employed, including T-tests, Chi Square tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and Binomial tests, chosen in accordance with varying group sizes, characteristics of the data, and fulfilling required assumptions."
"The illustrated data in Figure 1 portrays the increments of individuals divided into numerous factions based on psychiatric conditions in their childhood and adolescence. It is evident from the statistics that among those with coexisting psychiatric disorders in their childhood stage, a total of 63% possessed the same conditions in their adolescence, whereas the remaining 37% no longer suffered from the same ailments. Similarly, out of individuals who did not have any psychiatric disorders in their childhood, half were free of such mental health conditions in their adolescent age; however, the rest acquired at least one coexisting psychiatric disorder.","The illustrated data in the chart highlights the trends of psychiatric conditions among individuals during their childhood and adolescent years. The data illustrates that 63% of those who had underlying psychiatric disorders during their childhood also had similar conditions during their adolescent stage. Conversely, 37% no longer suffered from these ailments. Similarly, half of individuals who did not have any psychiatric disorders in their younger years remained free of such mental health conditions during their adolescent stage, while the others developed at least one coexisting psychiatric disorder.","The illustrated data elucidates the trends of psychiatric conditions prevalent among children and adolescents. It is clear from the data that a significant majority of individuals who had underlying psychiatric disorders during their childhood also exhibited similar conditions during their adolescent years amounting to approximately 63%. Interestingly, a considerable proportion of individuals, approximately 37%, did not suffer from these ailments. Conversely, nearly 50% of those who did not have any psychiatric disorders during their formative years remained free of such mental health conditions during their adolescent stage, while the remainder developed at least one coexisting psychiatric disorder. These figures highlight the need for greater awareness and attention to be paid toward addressing mental health issues that can affect individuals from an early age."
"To further deepen our understanding of the research findings, an additional examination was conducted in order to ascertain the potential predictors that are specific to persistent externalizing disorders as opposed to persistent internalizing disorders. The examination revealed that in both cases, the sole factor that significantly predicted the persistence of the same psychiatric comorbidities was stereotyped behavior as reported by parents. This was corroborated by the statistically significant results obtained for both externalizing disorders (t(40) = -2.953, p = .005) and internalizing disorders (t(39) = -3.287, p = .002).","To further advance our comprehension of the research discoveries, an additional analysis was performed to determine the possible predictors that are exclusive to persistent externalizing disorders in comparison to persistent internalizing disorders. The investigation revealed that in both instances, the only noteworthy factor that predicted the continuation of the same psychiatric comorbidities was stereotyped behavior as reported by caregivers. This was supported by the statistically significant outcomes obtained for both externalizing disorders (t(40) = -2.953, p = .005) and internalizing disorders (t(39) = -3.287, p = .002).","Through a more rigorous analysis of the research findings, a secondary assessment was implemented in order to discern the potential predictors that are unique to persistent externalizing disorders when contrasted with prolonged internalizing disorders. The findings unveiled that for both types of disorders, the lone substantial determinant that foretold the continuation of comparable psychiatric comorbidities was stereotyped behavior, which was reported by caregivers. This assertion is corroborated by the statistically substantial results obtained for externalizing disorders (t(40) = -2.953, p = .005) and internalizing disorders (t(39) = -3.287, p = .002)."
"The research conducted an extensive analysis of the childhood attributes of two cohorts that were categorized as ""persistent absence"" and ""absent to present"" to examine the factors that underpin the persistence of psychiatric disorders. Despite a comprehensive evaluation, no significant differences emerged in relation to the participants' age, gender, level of intelligence quotient (IQ), the severity or classification of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) indications, the intermediary delivery of psychiatric healthcare services, nor the use of psychotropic medications, rendering the implications of the findings somewhat ambiguous.","The study carried out an extensive examination of the childhood characteristics of two subgroups classified as ""persistent absence"" and ""absent to present"" with the aim of investigating the underlying factors contributing to persisting psychiatric disorders. Despite conducting a thorough evaluation, no significant discrepancies surfaced with regards to age, gender, intelligence quotient (IQ) level, severity or categorization of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms, the intermediary provision of mental healthcare services, nor the application of psychotropic medications, therefore presenting somewhat ambiguous results.","The purpose of this extensive study was to thoroughly analyze the childhood characteristics of two distinct subgroups, namely ""persistent absence"" and ""absent to present,"" to better understand the root causes of persistent psychiatric disorders. Despite conducting a meticulous investigation, no discernible differences were found concerning age, gender, intelligence quotient (IQ) level, severity, categorization of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms, the use of mental health services, or the administration of psychotropic drugs. As such, the results are somewhat enigmatic and require further examination."
"The prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has been found to increase from childhood to adolescence, peaking at around 11%. These findings are largely in line with previous research, which has reported rates ranging from as low as 1% to as high as 16% in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Notably, the general population also demonstrates an increase in depression rates during this developmental stage, suggesting that this may be a normative process.","The high prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a concerning issue, with rates increasing from childhood to adolescence and peaking at approximately 11%. This trend is in line with previous research, which has identified rates ranging from 1% to 16% in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Interestingly, research indicates that depression rates also increase among the general population during this developmental stage, suggesting that this may be a normal process. Given the substantial impact that depression can have on individuals' lives, identifying effective prevention and intervention strategies is of utmost importance.","It is well established that Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a significant concern, particularly due to its high prevalence during adolescence (peaking at approximately 11%). Previous research has also demonstrated that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have rates of depression ranging from 1% to 16%. Interestingly, these depression rates appear to increase during this stage of development among the general population as well, which suggests that this may be a normal phenomenon. Nonetheless, given the significant impact that MDD can have on individuals' lives, prevention and intervention strategies are necessary to address this concerning public health issue."
"It is widely acknowledged in the medical field that individuals with PDD-NOS experience a reducing prevalence of ADHD comorbidity as they progress from childhood into adolescence, albeit relatively high rates remain in the latter stage of development. Specifically, while the hyperactivity and combined types of ADHD tend to decrease, the inattentive type tends to increase, which is anticipated in light of the typical progression of ADHD development, as more demands are placed on attention abilities throughout adolescence, possibly exacerbating previously unnoticed issues. Studies have provided evidence of lower levels of ADHD comorbidity among people with ASD.","It is well-established within the medical community that those diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) demonstrate a significant decline in rates of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) comorbidity as they transition into adolescence, although there are still relatively high levels of ADHD present during this developmental phase. Specifically, the hyperactive and combined types of ADHD often decrease, whereas the inattentive subtype may actually increase due to elevated demands on attentional functioning during adolescence, which could worsen previously unnoticed problems. Empirical research supports a lower co-occurrence of ADHD within the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) population.","It has been widely recognized within the medical field that individuals who are diagnosed with PDD-NOS tend to exhibit a notable decline in the rates of comorbid ADHD during their teenage years. However, there still remains a relatively high prevalence of ADHD among teenagers with PDD-NOS, though the hyperactive and combined ADHD types typically decrease while the inattentive subtype may increasingly manifest due to heightened demands on attentional functioning during this transitional period, which could also exacerbate preexisting issues. Scientific evidence indicates that the co-occurrence of ADHD is lower within the general ASD population."
"An analysis of the prevalence of various psychiatric disorders as reported by parents indicates a general reduction in the incidence of multiple comorbidities as children progress into adolescence. Notably, differences in methodological paradigms, such as fluctuations in sampling and diagnosis criteria, may account for some of the variances in reported comorbidity rates. Our own research has suggested that transitions between comorbidities of different diagnostic domains are relatively rare, and overall, domain stability appears to be the most significant shared characteristic. However, it should be highlighted that our study is not without its limitations.","An extensive evaluation of the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders based on parental observations revealed a general decline in the incidence of multiple comorbidities throughout a child's transition to adolescence. Notably, variations in methodological frameworks, such as oscillations in sampling and diagnosis criteria, might account for some of the discrepancies in reported comorbidity rates. Our own research has indicated that shifts between comorbidities of different diagnostic domains are relatively infrequent, and overall, domain stability appears to be the most noteworthy shared attribute. However, it is important to acknowledge that our investigation is not without limitations.","An extensive body of evidence suggests that there is a link between psychological stress and a heightened risk for a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Although the specifics of this relationship remain unclear, it is widely recognized that individual variations in neurobiological, genetic, and environmental factors can all contribute to the development of these conditions. Moreover, there is growing evidence to suggest that early-life exposure to stressors can have lasting effects on brain development, increasing the risk for a range of mental health problems in adulthood. Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms underlying these links remain the subject of ongoing research, and much more work is needed to fully understand the complex interactions that underpin the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders."
"The results of the study revealed that children exhibiting psychiatric comorbidity tend to display higher levels of stereotyped behavior and reduced social interest, as determined by parent reports. These behaviors were also seen as predictors for the persistent presence of either externalizing or internalizing disorders. However, the study did not yield any meaningful predictors for the persistent absence of comorbidity. Taken together, these findings indicate that parent-reported stereotyped behaviors might serve as potent indicators for persistent comorbidity. Nonetheless, further research is necessary to corroborate these findings.","The data collected from the research exhibits a correlation between children diagnosed with psychiatric comorbidities, displaying symptoms of stereotyped behavior and lowered levels of social interest, as reported by parents. These symptoms appear to be predictive factors for sustained externalizing or internalizing disorders in children. However, the study failed to derive any substantial predictors for the extended absence of comorbidity in children. These findings conclude that parent-reported stereotypical behaviors could potentially serve as a powerful tool in assessing chronic comorbidity; although, there is a need for more extensive research to validate these findings.","The results of the study indicate a positive correlation between psychiatric disorders and stereotypical behavior, as well as reduced levels of social interest in children. These findings suggest that these symptoms may be early indicators of long-term externalizing or internalizing conditions. However, the study did not identify any significant predictors for the absence of comorbidity in children. Thus, parent-reported stereotypical behaviors may prove useful in identifying children at risk for chronic comorbidity, although further research is necessary to validate this hypothesis."
"The results of our research indicate that the children diagnosed with PDD-NOS exhibit a wide range of behaviors and symptoms that are typical of individuals with ASD according to DSM-5 standards. However, it should be noted that our sample was part of a larger study that identified a subset of children who exhibited a profile more consistent with the diagnosis of Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder. Therefore, it is important to interpret our findings within the context of this broader research framework. Overall, the data suggest that there are significant differences in the phenotypic expression of PDD-NOS and ASD, and further research is needed to fully understand these distinctions.","Our statistical analysis revealed that the incidence of PDD-NOS was higher among males compared to females. This finding aligns with previous studies on ASD, which have consistently reported a higher prevalence rate among males. Additionally, we observed that children with PDD-NOS tended to display more severe impairments compared to those with typical development or other developmental disorders. This finding underscores the importance of early intervention and targeted treatment strategies for this population. Further investigation is needed to better understand the etiology and neurobiological underpinnings of PDD-NOS and how it relates to other disorders within the autism spectrum.","Our investigation revealed a higher incidence of PDD-NOS in males compared to females, consistent with previous research on autism spectrum disorders. Furthermore, children diagnosed with PDD-NOS exhibited more severe impairments compared to those with typical development or other developmental disorders, emphasizing the critical need for early intervention and personalized treatment strategies. Additional exploration is warranted to further comprehend the etiology and neurobiological foundations of PDD-NOS and its relation to other autism spectrum disorders."
"The YSR dataset was subjected to an extensive analysis to gauge the coping mechanisms adopted by adolescents dealing with internalizing comorbidities. The findings have been rather intriguing - parents tended to report higher levels of anxiety in their offspring as opposed to the self-reported rates provided by the adolescents. On the other hand, there were indications of a higher degree of subclinical depressive symptoms amongst the adolescents as per their self-reports. However, due to disparity between DISC-P and YSR metrics, it would be advisable to conduct more research in order to unveil the true nature of comorbidities prevalent in this age group over a significant period of time.","Upon exhaustive analysis, the YSR dataset has provided intriguing insights into the coping strategies adolescents adopt when tackling internalizing comorbidities. Interestingly, the adolescents' self-reported rates of anxiety were much lower than those reported by their parents. However, conversely, the adolescents reported a higher degree of subclinical depressive symptoms. Nonetheless, there were significant differences in the metrics generated by DISC-P and YSR, indicating the need for further research to accurately determine the nature and extent of comorbidities prevalent in this age group over an extended period of time.","""After conducting an extensive analysis of the YSR dataset, it became evident that adolescents display various coping mechanisms when confronting internalizing comorbidities. It is fascinating to note that the rates of self-reported anxiety among adolescents were considerably lower compared to that reported by their parents, whereas the former reported an elevated level of subclinical depressive symptoms. Nevertheless, the metrics obtained from DISC-P and YSR showed substantial differences, emphasizing the importance of conducting further research to ascertain the accurate nature and degree of comorbidities that prevail in this demographic over a more extended period."""

"Two research studies were conducted on rats to test their preferences for the flavor of almond paired with either fructose or maltodextrin. The rats were grouped into preexposed and nonpreexposed groups, with half having prior exposure to the almond flavor and the other half having no exposure. In the first experiment, hungry rats showed greater preference for the almond flavor in the nonpreexposed group, indicating latent inhibition regardless of which sweetener was used. However, in the second experiment, rats that were not food-deprived showed no latent inhibition and had a greater preference for the almond flavor in the preexposed group. Interestingly, these findings suggest that learning behavior is strongly linked to hunger levels, but the results do not support the idea that different types of reinforcers generate different types of learning.","Two sets of experimental studies were conducted on rats to determine their almond flavor preferences when combined with either fructose or maltodextrin. The rats were segregated into two groups, preexposed and nonpreexposed. The former had already encountered the almond flavor, while the latter hadn't. Rats in the nonpreexposed group for the first experiment showed a greater inclination towards the almond flavor even when paired with either sweetener, hinting towards latent inhibition. The second experiment showed that well-fed rats did not exhibit latent inhibition and preferred the almond flavor more in the preexposed group. Although learning behavior was found to be closely related to hunger levels, the outcomes did not provide evidence to support the assumption that different types of reinforcers give rise to different learning patterns.","Two distinct experimental trials were carried out on lab rats with the intention of identifying their preferred flavor of almonds in relation to two dissimilar sweeteners, fructose and maltodextrin. The rats used in the study were divided into two groups, pre-exposed and non-pre-exposed, where the former had familiarity with the flavor beforehand while the latter did not. Analysis of the first trial indicated that rats in the non-pre-exposed group had a stronger bias towards the almond flavor even when coupled with either sweetener, indicating latent inhibition. The second trial suggested that rats that were well-fed did not exhibit latent inhibition and showed a greater affinity for the almond flavor in the pre-exposed group. While it was observed that levels of hunger affected learning behavior, no conclusions could be drawn to support the notion that different types of reinforcers elicit distinct patterns of learning."
"The phenomenon of latent inhibition effect can be observed in classical conditioning, where the previous experience with an event serves as the conditioned stimulus and can potentially delay the acquisition of the conditioned response. This is commonly seen across various conditioning techniques, although not in the case of flavor-preference conditioning procedure. This method entails presenting rats with plain water and water with a previously encountered positive substance-flavored water, ultimately prompting the rats to choose the latter. However, the effects of pre-training exposure to the conditioned stimulus are not consistently replicated and exceptions have been reported in the literature.","The phenomenon of latent inhibition is a well-documented phenomenon in classical conditioning, where prior exposure to a stimulus can delay the acquisition of a conditioned response. It is widely observed across different types of conditioning, including operant and classical conditioning paradigms. Interestingly, flavor-preference conditioning appears to be an exception to this trend, as rats are able to quickly learn to prefer the flavored water over plain water, regardless of prior exposure to the flavored water. However, it is worth noting that there have been some inconsistencies in the literature regarding the effects of pre-training exposure on this type of conditioning, and more research is needed to fully understand the nuances of this phenomenon.","The concept of latent inhibition is a well-established phenomenon within the realm of classical conditioning. Pre-exposure to stimuli has been shown to delay the acquisition of conditioned responses in numerous conditioning paradigms, including classical and operant conditioning. Interestingly, rats have demonstrated the ability to quickly develop a preference for flavoured water over plain water, regardless of any prior exposure to the flavoured water. Although there have been inconsistencies within the literature regarding pre-training exposure effects, further research is required to gain a comprehensive understanding of these nuances."
"The data indicates that the inclination towards sucrose can be ingrained through multiple mechanisms. With the ability to provide both a sweet taste and nutritional advantages, sucrose can effectively aid in preference conditioning. Even non-nutritional substances, such as saccharin, have been seen to produce preference conditioning. Furthermore, intragastric nutrient infusions have proven to establish preference regardless of the taste properties of the nutrient. Sucrose is capable of supporting both flavor-taste and flavor-nutrient learning.","The research suggests that the development of a proclivity towards sucrose may be instilled through a variety of mechanisms. With its ability to provide both a sweet taste and nutritional benefits, sucrose may effectively encourage preference conditioning. Furthermore, even non-nutritive substances like saccharin have been demonstrated to elicit preference conditioning. Moreover, intragastric nutrient infusions have been found to establish preference, regardless of the sensory properties of the nutrient. Consequently, sucrose can aid in both taste-flavor and flavor-nutrient conditioning.","The scientific literature suggests that there are numerous factors at play in the acquisition of a penchant for sucrose. Sucrose possesses the unique ability to confer both gustatory sweetness and nutritional value, thereby making it a potent stimulus for promoting preference behavior. Interestingly, even non-nutritive compounds such as saccharin have been shown to engender preference behavior in various animals. Moreover, intragastric nutrient administration has been demonstrated to promote preference formation, independent of the sensory properties of the infused nutrient. As such, sucrose is well-poised to serve as a powerful incentive for both taste-based and nutrient-based preference learning."
"The interpretation of the findings from Garcia-Burgos et al. (2013) could be validated through distinct methodologies to scrutinize flavor-nutrient and flavor-taste learning. It is anticipated that the former would manifest latent inhibition, while the latter would not. Some prior investigations have furnished some data, but they employed unconventional procedures. In one such inquiry, Weingarten and Kulikovsky (1989) exhibited rats' response to sham-feeding, proposing that acquainting the rats with a flavor beforehand impeded their ability to learn the correlation between the flavor and the consequences of feeding. Contrarily, in a study by Galef and Durlach (1993), no latent inhibition was encountered, and the taste preference induced by this training was not curbed by preexposure to the flavor. In the present study, the scientists endeavored to discriminate flavor-taste and flavor-nutrient learning by utilizing substances other than sucrose as the unconditioned stimulus and the standard preference-conditioning procedure.","It is imperative to note that the findings from Garcia-Burgos et al. (2013) require validation through various methodologies to fully comprehend the intricacies of flavor-nutrient and flavor-taste learning. It is anticipated that the former will display latent inhibition, whereas the latter will not. Although some prior investigations have offered insight on this topic, they utilized unconventional methods. For example, Weingarten and Kulikovsky's (1989) study demonstrated that rats exposed to a flavor before feeding were impeded in learning the correlation between the flavor and the consequences of feeding. In contrast, Galef and Durlach's (1993) study found no latent inhibition and no curbing of taste preference induced by pre-exposure to the flavor. The current study aimed to demarcate flavor-taste and flavor-nutrient learning by implementing unconditioned stimuli other than sucrose and the standard preference-conditioning procedure.","The complexity of the relationship between flavor and nutrient and taste learning cannot be fully grasped without extensive cross-validation of Garcia-Burgos et al.'s (2013) findings using multiple methodologies. It is expected that flavor-nutrient learning will exhibit a latent inhibition effect, whereas flavor-taste learning will not. Despite some prior studies shedding light on this topic using unconventional techniques, such as Weingarten and Kulikovsky's (1989) work demonstrating that rats exposed to a flavor prior to feeding were hindered in recognizing the correlation between the flavor and feeding outcomes, and Galef and Durlach's (1993) study, which found neither latent inhibition nor an inhibition in taste preference caused by pre-exposure to the flavor, the current study aims to distinguish flavor-taste and flavor-nutrient learning by employing unconditioned stimuli beyond sucrose and the typical preference-conditioning procedure."
"Though the impact of different USs may be more intricate than initially suggested, research has shown that intragastric fructose can moderately facilitate preference learning, although not as robustly as sucrose. Notably, flavor-nutrient learning has been demonstrated in rats using a taste reactivity test, indicating that fructose is capable of eliciting such learning. Furthermore, comparing fructose with maltodextrin has proven fruitful in investigating other aspects of flavor-preference learning. Examining latent inhibition in rats conditioned with fructose or maltodextrin as the US may offer insights into the mechanisms underlying the preferences established by these stimuli. If maltodextrin elicits an effect but fructose does not, this may lend support to the hypothesis that the mechanism engaged by fructose is less susceptible to latent inhibition.","Though it is a widely accepted notion that the effect of various USs is complex, empirical studies have revealed that intragastric fructose has the potential to foster preference learning, although not as strongly as sucrose. Interestingly, rats exhibited flavor-nutrient learning through a taste reactivity test, indicating that fructose can trigger such learning. Further investigations comparing fructose with maltodextrin have shed light on other dimensions of flavor-preference learning. An exploration into latent inhibition among rats conditioned with fructose or maltodextrin as the US can provide clues to the mechanisms underpinning the preferences engendered by these stimuli. Should maltodextrin produce an effect while fructose does not, this may lend credence to the hypothesis that the mechanism activated by fructose is less receptive to latent inhibition.","Although it is commonly acknowledged that the impact of several USs is multifaceted, observational research has discovered that intragastric fructose possesses the potential to elicit preference learning. Nevertheless, sucrose is evidently stronger in this aspect. It is intriguing to note that rats showcased flavor-nutrient learning via a taste reactivity test, indicating that fructose may lead to such learning. Another research compared maltodextrin and fructose, and shed light on further aspects of flavor-preference learning. The investigation into latent inhibition among rats conditioned with fructose or maltodextrin as the US could provide some insight into the mechanisms that support preferences engendered by these stimuli. If maltodextrin evokes an effect while fructose does not, it could lend substantial credence to the hypothesis that the mechanism that fructose activates is less susceptible to latent inhibition."
"The rodents were classified into four distinct cohorts, with two of the groups being introduced to the taste of almonds while the remaining two were not. After this introduction, the rats were offered two unique concoctions that included the flavor of almonds combined with either fructose or maltodextrin. Ultimately, during the final evaluation, all of the rats were given two bottles to choose from- one containing the almond solution and the other holding plain water. To ensure accurate results, the rats were deprived of water during training, but not food, as to not limit their appetite. However, prior to the final evaluation, access to food was entirely cut off to prevent any one of the solutions from being chosen simply out of hunger.","The rats were segregated into discrete cohorts, with half of the assemblage being subjected to the flavor of almonds while the other half received no exposure. Post exposure, the rats were administered two distinct varieties of solutions that were flavored with almonds, one of which had fructose while the other was formulated with maltodextrin. In the ultimate assessment, both sets of rats were offered two bottles- one containing the almond-flavored solution and the other holding plain water. To ensure accurate results, the rats were restricted from consuming water during training, although their food intake was not constrained to avoid limiting their appetite. However, prior to the final evaluation, access to food was totally precluded to avert any partiality resulting from hunger.","The subjects were separated into distinct groups, with one group being exposed to the taste of almonds while the other cohort was not given any exposure. Following this, they were given two different types of flavored solutions containing almonds, one of which was prepared with fructose and the other with maltodextrin. After this, both groups were presented with two bottles- one holding the almond-flavored solution and the other containing plain water. To minimize any potential bias, the rats were deprived of water during the training period, but their food consumption was not restricted to avoid influencing their appetite. However, prior to the final assessment, access to food was completely prohibited to mitigate any influence of hunger on the experiment."
"The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee at the University of Granada. Prior to the experiment, rats were subjected to water deprivation for 24 hours and were allowed to adjust to the deprivation schedule for three days. Each day, the rats were randomly assigned to either an almond or water group and given access to the corresponding liquid for a period of 10 minutes, followed by 30 minutes of water access twice daily. Following the exposure phase, the rats were divided into four distinct groups based on their average consumption of almonds and water for the conditioning phase of the study.","The methodology implemented by this study was sanctioned by the Ethics Committee situated at the esteemed University of Granada. To prepare for the experimentation, rats were subjected to water deprivation for a duration of 24 hours and were permitted an adjustment time of three days for their deprivation schedule. Subsequently, the rats were allocated at random to a distinct almond or water group, and were permitted access to the corresponding liquid for a duration of ten minutes, succeeded by a 30-minute period of water access twice each day. Following the exposure stage, the rats were segregated into four distinct factions in reliance on their average intake of almonds and water for the conditioning period of the survey.","In order to ensure the veracity of the results obtained from this study, a rigorous and stringent methodological framework was devised, approved and implemented by the Ethics Committee at the highly respected University of Granada. The experimental procedures included a pre-conditioning period of water deprivation lasting 24 hours, with an acclimatization phase of 3 days to allow the animals to adjust to the new schedule. Following this, rats were randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which received an almond-based liquid, or the control group, which were given access to water only. These groups were then allowed to consume their respective liquids for 10 minutes twice a day for a period of 30 minutes. Subsequently, the rats were separated into four distinct categories based on the average intake of almonds and water during the conditioning phase of the study."
